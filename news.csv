Sign up for TechCrunch Early Stage in Boston on April 25 and don't miss out on this fantastic show.
In this week's edition of Startups Weekly, we have some interesting stories to share with you. Let's dive right in!
Firstly, Stability AI has lost its founder and CEO, Emad Mostaque, who has decided to chase the decentralized AI dream. The company, known for burning through cash faster than a teenager with their first debit card, is now in the hands of interim co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte. Mostaque, in a dramatic exit, took to X to proclaim his departure was all about fighting the ""centralized AI"" bogeyman because, apparently, the real problem in AI isn't rogue robots but who gets to control them.
Microsoft has orchestrated a heist worthy of a Hollywood plot, snagging the co-founders and much of the staff of Inflection AI, along with the rights to use their tech, for a cool $650 million. The deal, which to me seems more like a ransom payment than an M&A push, includes $620 million for the privilege of using Inflection's tech and an extra $30 million to ensure Inflection doesn't sue for Microsoft's bold talent grab. Reid Hoffman, Microsoft board member and Inflection co-founder, took to LinkedIn to assure everyone that Inflection's investors would sleep well tonight, with early backers getting a 1.5x return and later ones a modest 1.1x, despite the math not quite adding up.
In other news, Facebook (now Meta) was caught red-handed with its digital hands in the Snapchat cookie jar. Dubbed “Project Ghostbusters,” Facebook’s covert operation aimed to snoop on Snapchat’s encrypted traffic, seeking to decode user behavior and gain a competitive edge.
Finally, Robinhood unveiled its Gold Card, a credit card so packed with features it might just make Apple Card users pause for a hot second. For the low, low price of being a Robinhood Gold member (because who doesn't want to pay $5 a month for the privilege of spending more money?), you too can earn 3","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1127591772.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-03-29 19:05:49,"1% cashback on all purchases, get a $100 sign-up bonus, enjoy exclusive perks like discounts on streaming services, and access to insider information on Robinhood's IPO.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Outdoor Days Lost by 2100: MIT Tool Shows Climate Change Impact"" ","Climate change is a complex and often overwhelming concept to understand. That's why a group of researchers at MIT have developed a tool that could help us make sense of what's happening to our planet's weather systems. The tool allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked.

The results of this tool are both alarming and comforting, depending on where you live. For people in California, France, Germany, and the UK, the climate won't be as hospitable in the summers, but it will be a little more clement in the spring and fall. This means that people in these regions will gain anywhere from a few days to nearly a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records.

However, some temperate places like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. In Illinois, people will lose more than a month of outdoor days by the 2080s as the summers grow unbearably hot. Texas will lose a month and a half for the same reason.

The countries with the most vulnerable populations will suffer the most. Nigeria's summers will grow even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India will lose almost two and a half months.

Despite these concerning predictions, there is hope. Even if the world fails to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but still manages to by 2070, the situation will improve dramatically. The tool is a relatable application of a field of study known as climate scenario analysis, a branch of strategic planning that seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics.

The MIT tool is just one example of how startups are using this relatively newfound predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern are all focused on providing investors, lenders, and insurers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. These startups also determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought and deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/instagram-is-developing-blend-recommended-reels-for-you-and-a-friend/,"Instagram is developing 'Blend,' recommended Reels for you and a friend",Instagram's 'Blend' Feature: A Personalized Reel Experience,"

Exploring Instagram's Innovative 'Blend' Feature for Reels

In the dynamic world of social media, Instagram is once again at the forefront of innovation with its development of a new feature known as 'Blend.' This feature, still in the prototype phase, is designed to curate a private feed of Reels tailored to you and a friend's shared interests.

The Genesis of 'Blend'

The existence of 'Blend' came to light through the investigative work of Alessandro Paluzzi, a reverse engineer known for uncovering upcoming social media features. Paluzzi's findings reveal that 'Blend' aims to offer a collection of Reels recommendations influenced by the content you and your friend have mutually enjoyed and shared.

A Personalized Social Experience

Imagine inviting a friend to join your 'Blend.' Instagram would then craft a feed brimming with Reels that resonate with both of your preferences. This concept mirrors Spotify's 'Blend' feature, which allows two users to merge their musical tastes into a single, harmonious playlist.

Privacy and Control

Privacy is a cornerstone of the 'Blend' experience. The feature ensures that the curated Reels remain a private affair between you and your chosen friend. Moreover, it offers the flexibility to exit the 'Blend' at any moment, giving users complete control over their participation.

The Potential Impact on Reel Discovery

Instagram's strategic move with 'Blend' could significantly enhance the discovery and viewing duration of Reels. By leveraging the data from Reels shared in direct messages, Instagram intends to proactively present content that pairs of users are likely to find appealing.

The Competitive Landscape

Should 'Blend' make its way to the public, it would introduce a collaborative dimension to Instagram Reels that is currently absent from TikTok, its main competitor. While TikTok remains a powerhouse in the short-form video arena, 'Blend' could provide Instagram with a nuanced advantage, fostering a more interactive and shared user experience.

Conclusion

As we await further details and the potential release of 'Blend,' it's clear that Instagram is not resting on its laurels. By continually seeking ways to enrich user engagement and content discovery, Instagram is poised to maintain its position as a leader in the social media landscape.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/openai-custom-voice-engine-preview/,"OpenAI built a voice cloning tool, but you can’t use it… yet"," ""OpenAI's Voice Engine: Potential for Fake News Combat, but Ethical Considerations"" ","As the world becomes increasingly focused on combating the spread of fake news and deepfakes, OpenAI is at the forefront of the movement to develop more sophisticated technologies to combat these threats. The company's latest innovation is a new tool called Voice Engine, which allows users to upload a 15-second voice sample and generate a synthetic copy of the voice. However, OpenAI is not rushing to make Voice Engine available to the public just yet, giving them time to respond to any potential misuse of the technology and develop mitigations to prevent abuse.

Training the Voice Engine model

The model that powers Voice Engine is already in use in other OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT's voice and ""read aloud"" capabilities, and Spotify's podcast dubbing service. The model was trained on a combination of licensed and publicly available data, with OpenAI keeping details of the training data close to the vest to avoid potential lawsuits.

OpenAI has licensing agreements in place with some content providers and allows webmasters to block their site from being scraped by the company's web crawler. However, the company does not offer an opt-out scheme for other products, and in a recent statement to the U.K.'s House of Lords, OpenAI suggested that it is ""impossible"" to create useful AI models without copyrighted material.

Synthesizing voice

Voice Engine does not use user data or fine-tuning controls. Instead, it generates speech by analyzing a combination of speech data and text data, producing a realistic voice that matches the original speaker. The audio generated is dropped after the request is complete, making it difficult to track or trace the source of the voice.

Although Voice Engine is not a novel technology, it has the potential to deliver higher-quality speech than its competitors, and it will be priced aggressively, with a cost of $15 per one million characters or around $1 per hour. While this is less expensive than some of its competitors, it does come at the expense of some customization.

Conclusion

OpenAI's latest innovation, Voice Engine, has the potential to be a powerful tool for combating fake news and deepfakes. However, the company must be careful to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and ethically. By taking a proactive approach to mitigating potential misuse and developing licensing agreements","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/openAI-pattern-04.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 17:00:58,"Optimized Meta Description:

Seamless solution eliminates inefficiencies, fostering trust and adoption among truckers.","Title: Streamlining Short-Haul Trucking with Iron Sheepdog: A Simplified Solution

Introduction

Iron Sheepdog, a company co-founded by Will Lawrence and Mike Van Sickel, has set its sights on simplifying the short-haul trucking industry through innovative technology. Headquartered in Williamsburg, Virginia, Iron Sheepdog's software aims to create a seamless and efficient experience for contractors, short-haul truckers, and brokers alike. The company recently secured a $10 million Series B round led by SJF Ventures, Grand Ventures, Supply Chain Ventures, and strategic partners. This investment signifies the growing need for efficient solutions in the short-haul trucking sector.

The Problem: Inefficiency in Short-Haul Trucking

The short-haul trucking industry traditionally relies on outsourcing short-distance jobs to truckers booked through brokers. This process often lacks transparency and efficiency, causing frustration for both contractors and truckers. To address these challenges, Iron Sheepdog offers a simple-to-use software solution that benefits all parties involved.

Iron Sheepdog's Seamless Solution

Iron Sheepdog's software provides contractors with real-time tracking for their contracted trucks, increasing transparency and efficiency. The platform enables contractors to monitor job progress, truck locations, and pay accurately while ensuring a user-friendly app for truckers to accept jobs and receive payments online.

Building Trust and Adoption

A crucial element of Iron Sheepdog's growth strategy is fostering trust and adoption among short-haul truckers. According to Mike Van Sickel, trust is the most important feature, as it encourages truckers to use the app. By focusing on the needs of the truckers first, Iron Sheepdog creates a ripple effect, leading brokers and contractors to adopt the platform.

Inspiration from Personal Experience

The idea for Iron Sheepdog emerged from the co-founders' personal experiences working for companies that hired short-haul truckers. Despite software solutions available for various aspects of their businesses, they noticed a lack of efficient options for managing short-haul truckers. This gap in the market inspired the creation of Iron Sheepdog.

A Unique Approach to Building Software

Unlike competitors, Iron Sheepdog took a bottom-up approach, starting with the short-haul truck drivers themselves. The company developed a simple app for truckers, offering 24-hour pay as an incentive for adoption. This approach differentiated Iron Sheepdog from its competitors and contributed to its consistent yearly growth.

Opportunities for Improvement

Now that Iron Sheepdog has amassed a substantial number of brokers and truckers on its platform, the company can focus on better utilizing these resources. By optimizing truck usage, companies can reduce the number of trucks needed, leading to cost savings and lower emissions. This strategy mirrors the approach taken by companies like Uber Eats, which optimizes deliveries to make the most of their drivers' time.

The Investment Landscape

Iron Sheepdog's recent funding round highlights growing investment in construction tech startups. However, this particular segment of the industry has not received as much attention. Software solutions that speed up job site planning are only effective if coordinating trucks can keep pace. Innovation in trucking has generally overlooked this area, but companies such as TruckIT, Loadtraxx, and Iron Sheepdog are working to change that.

Conclusion

Iron Sheepdog's mission to simplify the short-haul trucking industry has resonated with contractors, truckers, and investors alike. By focusing on trust, adoption, and optimization, the company is well-positioned to address inefficiencies in the sector and create a more seamless experience for all parties involved.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ISD_broker-truck.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 16:00:39,"Streamline your short-haul trucking operations with Iron Sheepdog, a simplified solution that empowers contractors, truckers, and brokers alike.

As AI continues to grow in popularity, the demand for energy-efficient semiconductor technology with a fast operational speed is on the rise. Traditional computing devices with their von Neumann architecture and separate computing and memory units have limitations in terms of speed and energy efficiency due to data processing bottlenecks. This has led to a surge in interest in neuromorphic devices that can perform both computing and memory functions simultaneously, similar to biological neurons.

Prof. Hyuk-Jun Kwon's team developed synaptic field-effect transistors using hafnium oxide, which has strong electrical properties, and thin layers of tin disulfide. This resulted in a three-terminal neuromorphic device capable of storing multiple levels of data in a manner similar to neurons.

The research successfully replicated biological characteristics such as short- and long-term properties, leading to a highly efficient device that responds 10,000 times faster than human synapses and consumes very little energy.

""This research represents an important step toward next-generation computing architecture, which requires low power consumption and high-speed computation,"" said Prof. Hyuk-Jun Kwon of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. ""We have developed high-performance neuromorphic hardware using two-dimensional channels and ferroelectric hafnium oxide, and the innovation is expected to have various AI and machine learning-related applications in the future.""

https://venturebeat.com/security/can-generative-ai-help-address-the-cybersecurity-resource-gap/,Can generative AI help address the cybersecurity resource gap?, How Generative AI is Transforming the Cybersecurity Workforce ,"Title: How Generative AI is Transforming the Cybersecurity Workforce

Are you tired of the challenges of finding, hiring, and maintaining a skilled cybersecurity workforce? Generative AI is here to help. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the cybersecurity industry by addressing the skills gap and enabling organizations to maximize their efforts in mitigating cyber risk.

One way generative AI can help is by lowering the bar to entry for new hires. Traditionally, the cybersecurity industry requires specialized training and certifications, which can be barriers to entry for many people. However, with the help of generative AI, technical documents and other cybersecurity information can be transformed into more dynamic training that meets new hires where they are, without requiring them to do extensive work before joining an organization.

Another way generative AI can make a difference is by creating more user-friendly documentation. Today, there are pages and pages of technical documentation for almost every cybersecurity tool on the market. Users often feel overwhelmed and rely on vendors to train them on how to use their solutions. Generative AI can be used to process and distill this same information into something much more precise and meaningful for the user. For example, instead of a customer spending hours combing through technical documentation to run a query in a specific tool, security teams can use generative AI to quickly provide the three to five steps required to do so.

Generative AI can also reduce the risk of burnout for security professionals. Large language models (LLMs) are designed to analyze and synthesize data. This capability can be applied to an organization's vast internal and external documentation, reducing the time that security analysts need to find information to do their job and communicate with their broader team. By reducing the administrative burden, security teams can focus on increasing time spent remediating and reducing risk.

Another area where generative AI can make a significant impact is in continual education. The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly evolving, and security professionals must stay up-to-date with the latest threats, attack vectors, and bad actors. However, too often, security professionals are bogged down handling incidents, writing policies, and drafting architectures and don't have the time to educate themselves on what's happening outside their organization. Generative AI can be used to gather and distill information relevant to an industry vertical from trusted sources, such as favorite trade publications, industry associations, and other preferred research and resource sites.

Finally, generative AI can improve cross-team organizational security communications. For example, if an organization sees persistent phishing attempts, generative AI can analyze the text and create custom messaging based on each department's function to best equip them to mitigate the risk. This can save time for the security organization and reduce incident load.

In conclusion, generative AI has the potential to transform the cybersecurity workforce by addressing the skills gap and enabling organizations to maximize their efforts in mitigating cyber risk. However, with any cutting-edge technology, it's crucial to carefully consider how it should be used and put the proper policies and safeguards in place. We recommend that organizations choose a gen AI platform and put in place a paid, contractual relationship so the vendor can provide guidance on the tool and help troubleshoot any issues.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/this-week-in-ai-let-us-not-forget-the-humble-data-annotator/,This Week in AI: Let us not forget the humble data annotator, Annotator Essential for AI Development: Scale AI ,"In the world of AI, keeping track of the latest developments can be a daunting task. This week in AI, we'll turn the spotlight on labeling and annotation startups, which are essential for the development of modern AI models. These startups, such as Scale AI, are reportedly in talks to raise new funds at a $13 billion valuation.

Labeling and annotation platforms are not as flashy as generative AI models like OpenAI's Sora. However, they play a crucial role in the development of AI models. Data on which many models train has to be labeled. Labels, or tags, help the models understand and interpret data during the training process. For example, labels for an image recognition model might take the form of markings around objects or captions referring to each person, place, or object depicted in an image.

The accuracy and quality of labels significantly impact the performance and reliability of the trained models. Annotation is a vast undertaking, requiring thousands to millions of labels for larger and more sophisticated data sets.

Despite the importance of annotation, many data annotators are not treated well. They are often paid low wages and lack access to benefits, mental health resources, and fair working conditions. Some companies, such as OpenAI, have relied on annotators in third-world countries, who are paid only a few dollars per hour and exposed to disturbing content.

Recently, Scale AI, which recruits annotators in countries such as Nairobi and Kenya, has come under scrutiny. Some of the tasks on Scale AI take labelers multiple eight-hour workdays, with no breaks, and pay as little as $10. These workers are also beholden to the whims of the platform, which sometimes goes long periods without providing work or unceremoniously boots off contractors.

Some annotation and labeling platforms claim to provide fair-trade work. However, there are no regulations or industry standards for ethical labeling work, and companies' definitions of ethical labeling work vary widely.

The need to annotate and label data for AI training is not going away. While self-regulation by these platforms is possible, policymaking seems to be the best shot at improving working conditions and ensuring ethical labeling work.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-optimization-based-method-autonomous.html,An optimization-based method to enhance autonomous parking, Revolutionize parking with OCEAN: Autonomous parking optimization-based planner ,"Title: Revolutionizing Autonomous Parking: Introducing the OCEAN Planner

Autonomous vehicles have been a topic of interest for both the robotics research community and the automotive industry. While there have been advancements in this area, self-driving cars are yet to be widely deployed. One specific application of autonomous driving that has garnered significant attention is Automated Valet Parking (AVP). This function allows a car to drive itself from a parking entrance to an available parking spot without human intervention. However, realizing this reliably has proven to be a challenge thus far.

Researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai have recently developed a solution to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous parking. Introducing the Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner (OCEAN), an optimization-based trajectory planner designed to improve the ability of cars to reach a parking spot without colliding with objects in their path. This innovative planner addresses the two primary shortcomings of previous approaches: inaccurate collision prediction and poor real-time performance.

The OCEAN planner is an evolution of the Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA) method, overcoming its limitations by improving its ability to avoid collisions, robustness, and speed in real-time applications. The researchers achieved this by carefully splitting optimization variables into groups, formulating ADMM sub-problems as Quadratic Programming (QP), Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved.

The OCEAN planner was tested in hundreds of simulated scenarios and real-world experiments in public parking areas. The results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed various autonomous parking approaches. Its superior system performance makes it possible to deploy large-scale parking planners on low computing power platforms requiring real-time performance.

The potential impact of this technology is significant. The OCEAN planner could be further refined and tested in additional real-world trials, eventually paving the way for its deployment by automotive companies. This development would contribute to the introduction of automated vehicle parking technologies, making parking safer, more efficient, and more convenient for everyone.

In conclusion, the OCEAN planner is a promising innovation in the field of autonomous parking. By addressing the limitations of previous approaches, this optimization-based trajectory planner significantly enhances the ability of cars to navigate parking areas safely and efficiently. As research in this area continues to progress, we can look forward to a future where autonomous parking is not only a reality but also a widely adopted and preferred method for parking our vehicles.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/x-confirms-plans-for-nsfw-communities/,X confirms plans for NSFW Communities, Twitter Embraces Adult Content with Community Labels ,"Today, Twitter announced that it will be allowing Community admins to set an “Adult Content” label in their settings, which will prevent their communities’ content from being auto-filtered by default. This change confirms earlier tests of NSFW communities on the platform and signifies that Twitter is now more directly embracing the adult content that has always been present on the platform.

NSFW content plays a significant role on Twitter, which has been a primary advertising venue for sex workers and a home to a large amount of adult content-focused bots and spam. According to internal documents obtained by Reuters in 2022, roughly 13% of all Twitter posts included NSFW content, such as nude and explicit photos, videos, and other pornography. Additionally, the documents revealed that adult content was one of the fastest-growing genres on the platform, even as news and sports were declining.

A recent report by New York Intelligencer detailed the rise of spam bots on the service, which promoted NSFW content with links in their profiles and bios. These bots regularly replied to posts with messages like “nudes in bio,” “pics in bio,” and other explicit terms.

As part of the updates to X’s Communities, Twitter has confirmed that NSFW-focused communities will now be allowed to designate themselves as such to avoid having their content filtered automatically, similar to other Communities. This change, posted on Twitter by an engineer, was reshared by Elon Musk, who commented, “Many upgrades to X Communities!”

X Communities are a key part of Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino’s growth plans for the platform. During an all-hands meeting last fall, Musk explained that the Communities product was growing fast but “there’s a lot of work to do to make Communities compelling.” He also shared that X was seeing “rapid percentage growth” in Communities, and had been adding new features, such as the ability to include any X account’s feed in the Community feed. For example, a video game-focused community may want to include the X accounts of notable video game reviewers or commentators.

If X is able to make Communities a successful product, it could potentially serve as a competitor to larger forum sites like Reddit and host training data for Musk’s xAI-run chatbot Grok, which has exclusive access to X content.

In addition to the ability to label adult content, Twitter is also introducing a Ban button alongside Keep and Hide buttons on the Reported posts page, along with more detailed messages explaining why you’re not eligible to join a given Community, and temporary and permanent bans for spammers. Users will soon be able to explore top posts and top communities across all Communities, and tools to discover top communities and posts by topic. Communities will also be promoted and recommended to potentially interested users on the For You tab, allowing them to grow more of a following. Mods will have access to Community Analytics and will be able to pin multiple members’ posts. There will also be support for spam filter levels set by admins, simplified reporting and moderation pages, and audio Spaces in Communities, among other things.

Twitter’s latest updates to X’s Communities signify a shift towards embracing adult content more directly on the platform. With the ability to label adult content and the introduction of a Ban button, it’s clear that Twitter is taking steps to improve the user experience for its communities while still maintaining a safe and respectful environment. As Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino continue to grow the platform, it will be interesting to see how X Communities evolve and what new features and updates are on the horizon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 16:07:11,"Meta Description: Twitter has announced that it will now allow Community admins to set an ""Adult Content"" label in their settings to prevent their communities' content from being auto-filtered.

Web3 startup Space and Time, founded by Scott Dykstra, aims to provide a solution through verifiable computing. This means that data can be indexed both off-chain and on-chain, making it more accessible and secure.

Dykstra’s concern is that AI data is not easily verifiable, which can lead to manipulation and fraud. This can be prevented by creating a decentralized, but globally available database that is operated by the community. This ensures that the data is readily available and uncensorable.

In the case of OpenAI, for example, it cannot be the proprietor of a database of a journal, as journalists are creating content. Instead, it must be owned by the community and operated by the community in a way that is readily available and uncensorable.

This is a crucial step towards ensuring that the world of AI is built on trust and integrity, and that data is not manipulated for personal gain.

","In recent years, the gig economy has become increasingly popular, thanks to the proliferation of computer-based platforms that connect individuals with temporary jobs. The gig economy was born out of a confluence of technological advancement and financial anxiety following the 2008 recession, and companies like Uber have taken advantage of this climate to become major players in the industry. While the gig economy has its benefits, it has also led to concerns about the commoditization of skills and assets, as well as the exploitation of workers. In this blog post, we will explore the rise of the gig economy, the impact it has had on the traditional taxi industry, and the challenges faced by workers in this new economy.

The Gig Economy: A Brief History

The gig economy predates the internet, with traditional forms of self-employment such as plumbing and handyman services being offered in local classified ads and newspapers. However, the proliferation of broadband internet allowed for the creation of computer-based gig platforms like Mechanical Turk, Fiverr, and Elance, which connected individuals with temporary jobs around the world. As smartphones became more popular, the gig economy took off, and everyone became an office and everything became a gig.

Mechanical Turk, founded in 2005, was one of the first gig platforms and was acquired by Amazon in 2010. Other companies such as Fiverr and Upwork also emerged, offering a range of services from freelance writing and graphic design to programming and software development.

Uber, founded in 2010, took the gig economy to the next level. The company quickly became infamous for its aggressive tactics, including railroading into new markets without getting approval from regulators. Uber's success was driven by its ability to disrupt the traditional taxi industry and turn it into a contractor-based model.

The Impact of Uber on the Taxi Industry

Uber's success had a significant impact on the traditional taxi industry, particularly in cities where it operated. The company's model of using a fleet of drivers and vehicles to provide rides on-demand disrupted the traditional taxi industry, which relied on medallions to regulate the number of cabs in a given market.

In many cities, taxi medallions were seen as a retirement plan for cab drivers, as they could be sold to new",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1_Kh9h_P4emCAe45VfYL_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/70ebe730-e083-11ee-adb4-2a4cdea0f515,2024-03-29 16:45:28,"Meta Description: Explore the rise of the gig economy, its impact on the traditional taxi industry, and the challenges faced by workers in this new economy.

Stripe's RFA unit, which helps businesses manage billing, tax, and revenue recognition, has seen significant growth in recent years. The company has announced that its RFA unit will reach a $500 million annual run rate this year. To further invest in this area, Stripe has also completed an ""acqui-hire"" of a four-person team from Supaglue, a startup that helps companies centralize data from third-party sources into their own applications.

Supaglue's founders, George Xing and Thomas Chen, were inspired to build the platform after working on the data teams at Lyft and Uber. They realized that managing data and business metrics across teams was inconsistent and fragmented, leading to bad decisions and worse business outcomes. The company's product aims to solve this problem by importing and centralizing customer data from various sources into a unified platform, providing relevant insights to end-users via dashboards, alerts, customer reporting, and real-time analytics.

Stripe's acqui-hire of Supaglue is one of several things the company has been up to this year. The employee stock sale deal and partnerships with companies like Clerk and Navier have also kept the company busy. Given the growth that Stripe has announced in its annual letter, it's likely that Supaglue will quickly find a home within Stripe's ecosystem and continue to grow in the RFA space.

In conclusion, Stripe's RFA unit is a fast-growing area for businesses, and the company's acquisition of Supaglue is a testament to its commitment to investing in this area. Supaglue's product is designed to help companies centralize and analyze data from various sources, providing valuable insights to end-users. With the growth of e-commerce and the need for businesses to manage their revenue and finance more efficiently, the RFA space is likely to continue to grow, and companies like Stripe and Supaglue will play a crucial role in this growth.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1110.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 13:30:19,"""Maximize Revenue and Efficiency with Stripe's RFA Unit and Supaglue's Data Centralization Solutions""","""Stripe's RFA Unit Growth""",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/google-pushes-podcasts-users-in-u-s-to-move-to-youtube-music-by-april-2/,"Google Podcasts is shutting down soon, users urged to move to YouTube Music", Google Podcasts Shutdown: Users Urged to Move to YouTube Music,"[INTRODUCTION]

Google has recently announced that it will be closing down its Podcasts app in the United States in the coming days. Users have been advised to transfer their subscriptions to YouTube Music by April 2 to ensure uninterrupted access to their favorite podcasts. This shift is part of Google's broader strategy to consolidate its audio services under the YouTube brand. Let's delve deeper into the reasons behind this decision and what it means for podcast enthusiasts.

[GOOGLE PODCASTS APP: A BRIEF OVERVIEW]

The Google Podcasts app, which has been installed over 500 million times on Android devices worldwide, has been a popular choice for podcast lovers for over half a decade. Its user-friendly interface and robust features made it an ideal platform for discovering, following, and listening to podcasts. Users could also add podcasts via RSS feed, providing them with a wide array of content to explore.

[THE TRANSITION TO YOUTUBE MUSIC]

In 2020, Google began encouraging users to migrate from Google Play Music to YouTube Music, a move that ultimately led to the demise of Google Play Music later that same year. Google Podcasts, however, continued to operate independently due to YouTube Music's inability to support podcasts until the end of 2023. By February 2024, YouTube Music had rolled out global support for podcasts and the ability to upload RSS feeds.

[REASONS BEHIND THE SHUTDOWN]

The decision to shift podcast services to YouTube can be attributed to various factors, such as the desire to centralize audio services and sharpen the company's focus on podcasting. Moreover, the growing interest in video podcasts presents an opportunity for Google to expand its presence in the space. Spotify, a major competitor in the podcasting market, recently announced a deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) to bring video podcasts to U.S. users, following earlier tests in 11 other markets.

[IMPACT AND TIMELINE]

According to Bleeping Computer, Google Podcasts users in the U.S. will be unable to use the app after the end of March 2024. However, Google has confirmed that users will have additional time to save their subscriptions by utilizing the app's export feature through July 2024. Google has yet to announce a timeline for the global discontinuation of the app, but it has previously stated that it plans to shut down the service worldwide in 2024.

[CONCLUSION]

While it is unfortunate that Google Podcasts will no longer be available in the U.S., the consolidation of audio services under YouTube may lead to enhanced features and greater focus on podcasting. For those affected by the change, transferring subscriptions to YouTube Music or exploring alternative podcast platforms is recommended. As the podcasting landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for users to stay informed and adapt to these shifts in the industry.

Effective immediately, the AI chatbot is officially prohibited due to concerns over the risk of leaking sensitive House data to non-House approved cloud services. This policy applies to all Windows devices owned by the Congress, but staffers are still allowed to use Copilot on their own laptops and phones.

This is not the first time that the Congress has set restrictions on the use of ChatGPT, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models. Last year, the Congress banned staffers from using the free version of the chatbot on House computers but allowed them to continue using the paid (ChatGPT Plus) version for research and evaluation.

The White House has also released guidelines for federal agencies when it comes to generative AI. These rules ensure that any tool used by agencies ""do not endanger the rights and safety"" of Americans. Microsoft has recognized the need for higher security requirements and has announced a roadmap of tools and services designed for government use. These include an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant, both of which feature higher levels of security.

Introduction

Orbit Fab, a visionary Colorado-based startup, is pioneering the future of in-space refueling with its flight-qualified docking mechanism, RAFTI (Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface). This cutting-edge technology, priced at just $30,000 per port, aims to transform the way satellites operate by enabling refueling in orbit. Orbit Fab's CEO and co-founder, Daniel Faber, bring decades of space industry experience, steering the company since its inception in 2018.

The Emergence of In-Space Refueling

Before founding Orbit Fab, Faber led Deep Space Industries, a firm focused on asteroid mining. The company's work on satellite thrusters for orbital maneuvering sparked Faber's interest in in-space refueling. As conversations with customers and colleagues unfolded, it became apparent that this technology could generate up to $1 million in marginal revenue for satellite missions with an extra kilogram of propellant.

The 2010s saw the emergence of satellite servicing companies, such as Astroscale, focusing on space debris removal, satellite life extension, and last-mile satellite delivery. Faber refers to these capabilities as ""tow truck applications"" and realized the potential need for orbital gas stations to complement this fleet.

Funding and Growth

Orbit Fab secured a $6 million seed round in its first year, with backing from investors like Bolt and Munich Re Ventures. A $28.5 million Series A round followed in 2023, fueling the company's ambitious vision. Orbit Fab's business model revolves around selling fuel and fueling ports, with the majority of revenue expected to come from fuel sales.

The RAFTI Design

The RAFTI design involves equipping customer satellites with refueling ports during the manufacturing process on Earth. These ports can also be used for ground fuelling before launch. Orbit Fab's tankers will deliver fuel from orbital depots to customer satellites when they run out of propellant.
