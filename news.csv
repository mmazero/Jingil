Introduction

In the realm of biology and robotics, the study of animal movements and their translation into innovative technological applications is a fascinating field. Professor Stanislav N. Gorb and his team at Kiel University's Institute of Zoology are known for their expertise in this area. They have created robot grab arms based on insects and a detachable adhesive film inspired by the adhesive organs of insects, spiders, and geckos. In a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Gorb and his collaborators from China examined the Chinese rice grasshopper (Oxya chinensis) to understand its unique ability to swim and jump out of water, offering valuable insights for advanced robotics.

Unraveling Water Acrobatics

The Chinese rice grasshopper is a remarkable creature, particularly adept at water acrobatics for a land animal. This ability is crucial for its survival, as it often resides in China's rice-growing regions along the Yangtze River. To study the mechanics of the grasshopper's aquatic acrobatics, Gorb and his team conducted an experiment involving 15 grasshoppers. They were placed in a glass tank full of water and filmed using high-speed cameras, capturing a total of 102 attempts to jump or swim.

The researchers found that body weight support through hydrostatic pressure and controlled interactions between the grasshopper's limbs and water (hydrodynamics) were responsible for facilitating water acrobatics. This dual mechanism allowed the grasshopper to support its weight through static forces while moving its body forward using hydrodynamics.

A New Drive Strategy for Robotics

Previous research has primarily focused on two types of locomotion on the surface of the water: locomotion supported by surface tension and locomotion dominated by the special dynamics of the limbs. However, neither strategy is ideal for bioinspired technical applications. The Chinese rice grasshopper's ability to jump out of the water presents a new drive principle based on a combination of static hydro forces and hydrodynamics.

A significant development is underway as seven open source foundations join forces to create common specifications and standards for Europe's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). This alliance includes the Apache Software Foundation, Blender Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, OpenSSL Software Foundation, PHP Foundation, Python Software Foundation, and Rust Foundation. Their primary objective is to align existing security best practices in open source software development, ensuring that the software supply chain is prepared for the CRA implementation within the next three years.

Software Components and the Cyber Resilience Act

Studies suggest that between 70% and 90% of today's software comprises open source components, many of which are created by independent programmers in their spare time. The Cyber Resilience Act, adopted by the European Parliament last month, aims to establish best cybersecurity practices for hardware and software products sold across the EU. This legislation requires manufacturers to keep up with all patches and security updates, imposing fines for noncompliance. These penalties can reach up to €15 million or 2.5% of global turnover.

Initial criticism of the CRA from open source industry bodies, including more than a dozen open source organizations, centered on potential liability for security defects in downstream products, which might deter volunteer maintainers from contributing to critical components due to legal concerns. However, the final regulation addressed these concerns by clarifying open source project exclusions, exempting developers not involved in commercial activities.

The Role of Open Source Foundations

As the CRA won't take effect until 2027, the seven open source foundations have collaborated to meet the requirements and refine expectations. Key challenges include inconsistent documentation and diverse best practice standards, with many open source projects using unique methodologies and terminologies. This collaboration aims to standardize open source software development and ensure comprehensive documentation for audits and downstream developers.

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), a fascinating insight has emerged: massive AI programs contain smaller sections that can perform the total program's tasks more efficiently. This concept, known as the ""lottery ticket hypothesis,"" has been gaining traction as companies find ways to shrink AI to fit on fewer GPU chips, requiring less memory and bandwidth. This blog post delves into the practical applications of this hypothesis and how it can revolutionize AI performance.

The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: A Brief Overview

The lottery ticket hypothesis, introduced by Jonathan Frankle and Michael Carbin in a 2019 paper, posits that large AI programs have smaller sub-networks capable of performing the same tasks with higher efficiency. This discovery has paved the way for companies to optimize AI performance by identifying and utilizing these ""winning tickets.""

Practical Applications: Slimming Down AI

A team of researchers from Meta's AI lab, MIT, Cisco Systems, and start-up Zyphra has taken significant strides in implementing the lottery ticket hypothesis in real-world scenarios. In a recent paper, they demonstrated that removing up to half of Meta's open-source Llama 2 large language model led to a 75% reduction in memory usage, enabling the program to run on consumer-grade Nvidia or AMD GPUs instead of massive server racks.

This achievement showcases the potential of the lottery ticket hypothesis in making AI more accessible and cost-effective. By identifying and removing ineffectual layers, AI programs can become more streamlined and efficient, requiring fewer resources to achieve the same level of performance.

The Ineffectiveness of Deeper Layers

Gromov and team's paper, titled ""The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers,"" highlights the discovery that the latter parts of a neural network, referred to as ""deep layers,"" often contribute minimally to the network's output. In the context of a neural network as a marching band, this would mean that the ""percussion instruments"" and some ""tubas"" have little impact on the overall sound produced by the band.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-team-biofilm-resistant-glass-marine.html,Research team creates biofilm-resistant glass for marine environments, UV-Emitting Glass: 98% Less Biofilm in Underwater Surfaces ,"Title: Revolutionary UV-Emitting Glass: A Game Changer in Underwater Biofilm Management

Introduction

Imagine a world where underwater surfaces remain consistently clean and free from harmful biofilm, without the need for harsh chemicals or constant maintenance. This vision is now one step closer to reality, thanks to a groundbreaking invention by a team of engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They have developed an innovative ultraviolet (UV) rays-emitting glass that significantly reduces biofilm growth on underwater surfaces, offering a promising solution to a problem that costs the US Navy alone between $180 and $260 million each year.

What is Biofilm and Why is it Problematic?

Biofilm is a thin, slippery layer composed of various microorganisms that adhere to damp surfaces. It is prevalent in underwater environments, posing challenges for numerous applications, including shipping, oceanography, and aquaculture. Existing countermeasures involve chemical agents like biocidal coatings, which can negatively impact the ecosystem and have limited longevity.

Introducing the UV-Emitting Glass

In response to these limitations, the UMass Amherst team introduced an eco-friendly alternative – UV-emitting glass. Utilizing UVC radiation, the shortest and most efficient wavelength of UV radiation for disinfection purposes, this novel material substantially decreases biofilm development on underwater surfaces.

Dr. Mariana Lanzarini-Lopes, Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UMass Amherst and a corresponding author on the paper, states, “Our UV side-emitting optical fiber has already shown promise in distributing UVC radiation in narrow channels, such as medical equipment, home appliances, and water storage/distribution systems, to eliminate pathogens and prevent bacterial growth.”

Challenges of Using Traditional UV Light Sources

Despite the established benefits of UV light for sterilization purposes, implementing UV lighting in underwater settings presents unique difficulties. Conventional light sources struggle to uniformly distribute UV light over expansive surface areas due to diminishing intensity as distance from the source increases and interference caused by turbid water. To tackle these hurdles, the researchers devised an ingenious strategy involving a silica-nanoparticle coating applied to the glass.

How Does the Silica-Nanoparticle Coating Work?

Leila Alidokht, Postdoctoral Research Associate in Dr. Lanzarini-Lopes’ lab and the lead study author, explains, “By scattering UV internally from within the glass via light-scattering nanoparticles, we create an evenly ‘glowing’ glass surface that maintains its effectiveness despite potential interruptions from exterior factors.” Importantly, the silica particles do not absorb the UV rays; instead, they enable consistent dispersion throughout the glass interior, thereby preventing biofilm attachment and proliferation.

Testing and Results

Subsequent submersion tests conducted in conjunction with Florida Tech and the Navy revealed that the UV-emitting glass displayed a remarkable 98% reduction in visible biofilm growth compared to untreated glass after twenty days in seawater. Furthermore, unlike conventional techniques requiring continuous exposure to UV light, this cutting-edge glass continues to impede biofilm formation even when not actively emitting UV rays.

Potential Applications and Future Developments

With implications ranging from marine transportation to scientific instrumentation, the inventors envision widespread adoption of this transformative technology. Possible uses include disinfection of transparent surfaces such as ship windows, floatation spheres, buoys, camera lenses, and sensors employed in agriculture, water management, and oceanography. Currently, the team holds a provisional patent for their invention, setting the stage for further advancements in large-scale production and long-term application evaluations. As research progresses, this revolutionary innovation promises to profoundly influence our interaction with underwater environments, fostering sustainability and efficiency gains for years to come.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-team-creates-3.jpg,2024-04-02 16:32:33,"Discover a game-changing UV glass that reduces underwater biofilm by 98%.

Revolutionary Ultraviolet (UV) Rays-Emitting Glass: A Game Changer in Underwater Biofilm Management

A new era of underwater surface maintenance has arrived, thanks to a pioneering UV glass invention by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This breakthrough offers a promising solution to manage biofilms in marine environments, potentially saving millions in annual expenses.

Biofilm refers to slimy layers formed by microorganisms on wet surfaces. Commonly found in underwater settings, biofilms pose problems across industries such as shipping, oceanography, and aquaculture. Current methods rely on chemical agents like biocidal coatings, which may harm ecosystems and provide only temporary relief.

The newly developed UV-emitting glass harnesses UVC radiation—the shortest, most effective UV wavelength for disinfection purposes—to significantly reduce biofilm growth on submerged surfaces. According to Dr. Mariana Lanzarini-Lopes, ""Our UV side-emitting optical fiber has proven successful in distributing UVC radiation in confined spaces, making it suitable for various applications.""

Traditionally, using UV light sources underwater presents specific challenges, such as uneven distribution and reduced intensity over distance. By incorporating a silica-nanoparticle coating into the glass design, scientists addressed these issues effectively. Leila Alidokht notes, ""Silica particles scatter UV internally, enabling consistent dispersion throughout the glass interior and hindering biofilm attachment.""

Experiments conducted in collaboration with Florida Tech and the Navy showed a striking 98% decrease in visible biofilm growth on UV glass samples compared to controls after 20 days in seawater. Unlike existing strategies relying on continuous UV exposure, this advanced material remains effective at inhibiting biofilm formation even when not actively emitting UV rays.

Aside from marine transport and scientific tools, other possible applications include sanitizing transparent surfaces in agriculture, water management, and oceanography.

Google Settles Privacy Suit: Blocks Third-Party Tracking Cookies in Incognito Mode","Title: Google to Overhaul User Privacy Measures: A Groundbreaking Settlement and New Policies

Introduction

In a significant move to protect user privacy, Google has committed to modifying its data collection practices and settling a class-action lawsuit concerning its Incognito Mode. This development comes after revelations indicating that Google continued to track users even when they utilized the private browsing feature. As part of the settlement, Google will revamp its approach to cookies, implementing new measures aimed at enhancing user privacy.

Body

Google's Proposed Changes Following Class-Action Lawsuit

Last month, Google agreed to modify its data handling procedures significantly to resolve a class-action lawsuit alleging deceptive tracking practices (AFP, 2024). According to the agreement, if approved, Google will remove or rectify billions of data records related to users accessing the internet via Chrome's Incognito Mode (AFP, 2024). By taking these actions, Google strives to ensure transparency regarding user data utilization and promote trust among its users.

The lawsuit stemmed from claims that Google misled users into believing their activities remained anonymous during Incognito sessions (Knight, 2020). However, internal communications revealed Google still monitored such activity for ad targeting purposes (Knight, 2020). Consequently, the company faces criticism for exploiting user expectations surrounding privacy protection.

Settlement Details and Implications

Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Google won't pay any cash damages; instead, affected users can seek financial compensation independently through separate lawsuits (AFP, 2024). Notably, the initial lawsuit demanded at least $5 billion in damages—a figure reflecting potential consumer harm resulting from perceived privacy violations. Despite avoiding a substantial fine, Google acknowledges the importance of addressing user concerns and fostering confidence in its platforms.

One critical aspect of the settlement involves blocking third-party tracking cookies in Incognito Mode for the subsequent five years (AFP, 2024). These tiny files enable websites to monitor visitors' navigation habits across different domains and tailor targeted advertisements accordingly (Ghosh & Kashyap, 2020). With growing regulatory scrutiny over cookie use, Google aims to assuage user concerns about unwanted surveillance and bolster its reputation as a responsible custodian of personal data.

Additionally, Google plans to phase out support for third-party cookies entirely within two years (Ghosh & Kashyap, 2020). Although initially announced in early 2020, implementation faced delays due to pushback from web publishers reliant on ad revenue generated through cookie tracking. Nonetheless, recent policy updates demonstrate progress toward a cookieless future, thereby alleviating user anxieties surrounding invasive monitoring techniques.

Addressing EU and Californian Regulations

As regulators worldwide intensify efforts to curb intrusive digital marketing strategies, Google has responded proactively. Specifically, the European Union implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, granting citizens increased control over their personal information and imposing stringent penalties for violations (European Parliament and Council, 2016). Similarly, California enacted legislation designed to safeguard residents' online privacy rights (California Legislative Information, 2018).

By embracing sweeping changes to its data management protocols, Google demonstrates commitment to complying with evolving privacy standards established both domestically and internationally. Moreover, these modifications signal the company's intent to prioritize user trust above short-term profit maximization tactics, thus reinforcing its position as a leading global technology provider.

Conclusion

Google's decision to alter its data collection practices and settle the class-action lawsuit marks a pivotal moment in promoting user privacy. Through commitments like discontinuing third-party cookies and enhancing transparency around Incognito Mode, Google seeks to strengthen relationships with its customers while maintaining compliance with burgeoning privacy laws. Ultimately, these developments underscore the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing ethics and the necessity for organizations to remain vigilant in protecting user data rights.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/google-has-said-it-is.jpg,2024-04-01 16:00:22,"Meta Description: Google to Overhaul User Privacy: Blocks Third-Party Cookies & Settles Class-Action Lawsuit | Learn about Google's new measures to enhance user privacy, including blocking third-party cookies in Incognito Mode for 5 years and settling a class-action lawsuit concerning Incognito Mode tracking.

The researchers have informed peers and competitors, and are exploring mitigation strategies to prevent this exploitation while maintaining model performance.","Title: Unveiling the ""Many-Shot Jailbreak"": A New Vulnerability in Large Language Models

Introduction

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, so are the techniques to exploit it. A new vulnerability has been discovered in large language models (LLMs), allowing them to be manipulated into providing harmful or inappropriate responses. This ""many-shot jailbreak"" technique, as described by Anthropic researchers, involves priming the model with a series of less-harmful questions before eventually coaxing it to generate inappropriate content. This article will delve into the details of this discovery and discuss potential mitigation strategies.

The Many-Shot Jailbreak Technique

Anthropic researchers recently uncovered a new vulnerability in LLMs that involves a process called ""many-shot jailbreaking."" This technique convinces a large language model to generate harmful content, such as instructions on building a bomb, by first presenting it with a list of less-harmful questions. The model, which has an increased context window, allowing it to hold more data in its short-term memory, performs better when there are multiple examples of a task within the prompt.

In-Context Learning and Its Unintended Consequences

The latest generation of LLMs utilizes ""in-context learning,"" which enables the model to improve its performance on tasks as more examples are provided within the prompt. This learning mechanism allows the model to gradually activate latent powers related to the task at hand, such as trivia knowledge or, in this case, the ability to generate inappropriate content.

When presented with a series of 99 less-harmful questions, the model becomes more likely to comply with a subsequent inappropriate request, such as providing instructions on building a bomb. This unexpected extension of in-context learning highlights the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that allow LLMs to hone in on user intent.

Mitigation Strategies and Responsible Disclosure

The Anthropic team has taken a proactive approach in addressing this vulnerability by informing their peers and competitors about the attack. They hope that this open sharing of exploits will foster a culture of transparency and collaboration in AI security.

In terms of mitigation, the team found that limiting the context window has a negative impact on the model's performance.

Imagine a world where windows not only illuminate our interiors but also actively help reduce cooling costs, maintaining functionality and efficiency regardless of the sun's position. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame have made this vision a reality by developing an innovative window coating that blocks heat-generating ultraviolet and infrared light while allowing visible light to pass through, regardless of the sun's angle. This groundbreaking invention promises to cut air-conditioning cooling costs by more than one-third in hot climates, revolutionizing the way we think about energy efficiency.

Traditional window coatings are often designed with a specific angle of light incidence in mind, typically at a 90-degree angle. However, the sun's position is seldom consistent, particularly during the hottest times of the day when the sun's rays enter vertically installed windows at oblique angles. To address this challenge, researchers Tengfei Luo, the Dorini Family Professor for Energy Studies at the University of Notre Dame, and his postdoctoral associate Seongmin Kim, designed a transparent window coating by stacking ultra-thin layers of silica, alumina, and titanium oxide on a glass base. A micrometer-thick silicon polymer was added to enhance the structure's cooling power by reflecting thermal radiation through the atmospheric window and into outer space.

To ensure the coating would accommodate multiple angles of solar light, the researchers turned to an unconventional approach: quantum computing and quantum annealing. This cutting-edge technology helped shuffle the layers into an optimal configuration, maximizing visible light transmission while minimizing the passage of heat-producing wavelengths. The resulting coating maintained transparency and reduced temperature by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees Celsius (about 41 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit) in a model room, even when light was transmitted in a broad range of angles.

The significance of this achievement extends beyond energy-efficient windows. Luo explained, ""The active learning and quantum computing scheme developed to create this coating can be used to design a broad range of materials with complex properties.""

Meanwhile, in the startup realm, Lucid Motors aims to produce just 9,000 luxury sedans in 2024—a conservative figure considering earlier predictions. Similarly, Fisker has encountered numerous setbacks, managing to sell merely half of the 10,000 electric SUVs manufactured in 2023. Consequently, Rivian finds itself contending not only with traditional powerhouses but also fellow newcomers vying for market share and brand recognition.

Strategic Priorities

To traverse this complex terrain successfully, Rivian needs to prioritize several strategic objectives:

1. Accelerate production ramp-up: Ensuring smooth line transitions following facility downtime is imperative for sustaining momentum and minimizing potential disruptions caused by extended pauses.

2. Implement effective cost reduction measures: Successfully executing planned factory updates to reduce manufacturing costs without compromising product quality will significantly impact future profitability prospects.

3. Strengthen supply chain resilience: Establishing robust relationships with suppliers and fostering agility in response to component availability fluctuations will aid in mitigating risks associated with volatile input markets.

4. Cultivate customer loyalty: Delivering exceptional ownership experiences across all touchpoints will foster trust and advocacy among early adopters, bolstering word-of-mouth referrals and reinforcing positive brand associations.

Conclusion

As Rivian moves further into 2024, addressing pressing concerns regarding production volume, cost management, and overall competitiveness becomes increasingly vital. By focusing on enhancing operational efficiencies, fortifying supplier networks, and providing outstanding customer experiences, Rivian stands poised to navigate choppy waters and ultimately secure its position within the rapidly shifting EV sector.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rivian-test_large_ysttpj.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-02 14:49:42,"Meta Description:

Introduction

Rumors have been swirling around the internet, suggesting that Meta (formerly known as Facebook) granted Netflix access to its users' private messages. These claims gained traction when Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to several posts regarding this issue on Twitter. According to him, such actions violate user privacy and raise concerns about data protection practices. However, both Meta and Netflix have since issued statements dismissing these rumors. So, what is the truth behind these allegations? Let's delve deeper into the story and find out.

Allegations of Private Message Access

Recently, a court filing surfaced during the discovery phase of a class-action lawsuit against Meta concerning its data privacy policies. Among various accusations related to the misuse of user data, one particular point caught everyone's attention—the alleged partnership between Meta and Netflix. As per the document, Netflix enjoyed ""special treatment"" from Meta, with the former gaining access to the latter's ""Inbox API."" This supposedly enabled Netflix to view users' private message inboxes programmatically.

Musk's Reactions and Backlash

When Musk came across these reports, he expressed his disbelief through tweets, stating, ""Wow"" and ""Yup,"" thereby drawing widespread criticism towards Facebook. Netizens accused the platform of selling user data, raising questions about privacy breaches.

Denial of Privacy Invasion

Despite the growing outrage, Meta maintains that it never shared users' private messages with Netflix. Instead, the company states that the collaboration permitted Netflix users to send messages to their friends on Facebook, informing them about shows and movies available on the streaming platform. Although Netflix indeed had access to certain features of Facebook Messenger, Meta insists that it was solely utilized for enabling communication between users.

Previous Claims Regarding Third-Party Apps

Interestingly enough, similar accusations arose in 2018 involving Netflix and another major tech giant, Spotify. At that time, internal documents revealed that both companies accessed APIs permitting them to read users' private messages. Nevertheless, Meta quickly dismissed these allegations, asserting that neither firm was privy to personal conversations without explicit consent. Moreover, the social media titan published a blog post clarifying its stance on messaging partnerships and emphasizing its commitment to maintaining user privacy.

A History of Close Ties Between Meta and Netflix

It appears that the connection between Meta and Netflix goes beyond mere speculation. By 2015, Netflix invested heavily in Facebook ads, allocating approximately $40 million annually. Furthermore, the streaming platform collaborated closely with Facebook executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Elliot Schrage, and Andrew Bosworth. Interestingly, Netflix continued sharing user data with Meta for targeted advertising purposes.

Conclusion

Amidst the controversy surrounding the alleged sharing of private messages, it remains essential to distinguish facts from assumptions. While the court filings indicate some form of cooperation between Meta and Netflix, both parties deny granting unauthorized access to users' private messages. To ensure better transparency and accountability, platforms must prioritize user privacy while fostering mutually beneficial relationships with third-party services.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/meta-distorted-glitched.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-02 19:09:22,"Meta Description:

Introduction

Rumors about Meta allowing Netflix access to users' private messages have recently resurfaced due to a court filing in a class-action lawsuit against Meta. With Elon Musk joining the fray by expressing concern over potential privacy invasion, it is crucial to separate fact from fiction. Here's our take on the situation.

Court Filing Details

The disputed court filing reveals that Netflix received ""special treatment"" from Meta, including access to the Inbox API. Critics argue that this allowed Netflix to view users' private messages without permission. However, Meta has consistently denied these allegations, claiming that the partnership facilitated friend-to-friend communication about Netflix content only.

Elon Musk's Take

As the story unfolded, Elon Musk voiced his opinions on Twitter, which further fueled public skepticism. Despite Musk's reaction, no concrete evidence supports the claim that Netflix could read users' private messages without authorization.

Past Incidents and Partnerships

In 2018, there were allegations that both Netflix and Spotify used APIs to read users' private messages. Meta refuted those claims then, just as they are doing now. Additionally, Netflix maintained close ties with top Meta executives, investing significantly in Facebook advertisements and sharing user data for targeted promotions.

Addressing User Privacy Concerns

Both Meta and Netflix continue to assure users that their private information remains secure. It is important to note that any collaboration between two entities requires clear guidelines on how user data will be handled and protected. Users can take steps to safeguard their online privacy by managing app permissions and staying informed about corporate data usage policies.

Final Thoughts

While the court filing does suggest some level of collaboration between Meta and Netflix, there is currently no solid proof indicating unauthorized access to users' private messages. Companies engaging in partnerships need to maintain transparency regarding data handling practices and uphold stringent measures to protect user privacy.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

In today's rapidly evolving world, artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way into various industries, offering endless possibilities. However, this technological invasion might have severe implications for the music industry. Recently, more than 200 artists, representing different genres and eras, joined forces to address the significant dangers AI poses to music.

The Artist Rights Alliance, an organization advocating for musicians, drafted an open letter, initially published by Variety, highlighting the perils of AI for music creation. Among the notable signatories were Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, the estates of Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra, Billie Eilish, Jon Bon Jovi, and Smokey Robinson. To view the full list of signees, click here.

The letter strongly condemns two critical aspects concerning AI and music:

1. Using artist voices without permission to train AI models, essentially exploiting their identities;
2. Predatory utilization of AI, described as an ""assault on human creativity,"" threatening the very essence of artistic expression and jeopardizing artists' income sources.

As the letter aptly puts it, ""We call on AI developers, technology companies, platforms, and digital music services to cease the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.""

Indeed, AI holds immense potential to foster creativity. Our own David Gewirtz utilized AI to effortlessly distribute his music through major platforms. Nevertheless, misusing such powerful technology may lead to undermining artists, songwriters, musicians, and other stakeholders involved in creating music. Ultimately, this abuse endangers their livelihoods.

Major corporations employ artist voices to train AI systems intending to replace human performers. Such actions blatantly disregard the authentic contributions made by hardworking musicians who dedicate themselves to honing their craft. The open letter concludes:

""Unchecked, AI will set in motion a race to the bottom that will degrade the value of our work and prevent us from being fairly compensated for it. This assault on human creativity must be stopped. We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal professional artists' voices and likenesses, violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem.""

To preserve fair compensation for artists, the letter urges companies, platforms, and digital music services to commit not to developing or deploying AI-generated music technologies, tools, or content.

Lately, discussions around AI's role in entertainment have intensified, leading to congressional hearings, legal measures, strikes, and policy changes. In 2023, Hollywood writers protested AI-generated content, while Spotify removed AI imitations of actual voices. Although completely eliminating AI-generated music appears unlikely, ensuring fair remuneration for artists remains crucial.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/48e24404db64d2ff95a8af9ca3b1f712a1954aa4/2024/04/02/286d31a4-7b19-456e-9073-4a5d3fc79d72/rovotmusicgettyimages-1471299905.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-02 12:38:00,"""Join musicians fighting unfair AI intrusion!

MusicAI ArtisticIntegrity"," Title: Musicians Unite Against Unfair AI Intrusion: The Fight for Artistic Integrity and Income

A growing number of musicians across various genres and generations are raising concerns about the negative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the music industry. An open letter signed by over 200 artists highlights the threats that AI poses to creative freedom and financial stability. High-profile figures like Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, the estates of Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra, Billie Eilish, Jon Bon Jovi, and Smokey Robinson are among those demanding action.

The crux of the issue lies in two primary areas:

1. The unauthorized usage of artists' voices to train AI models, effectively capitalizing on their identity without consent;
2. Exploitative application of AI, deemed as an attack on human creativity, which could fundamentally alter artistic expression and diminish artists' revenue streams.

The appeal emphasizes these issues, stating, ""We request AI developers, tech firms, platforms, and digital music providers to refrain from utilizing AI to breach the intellectual property rights of human artists.""

Undoubtedly, AI offers numerous benefits when employed ethically. For instance, our contributor David Gewirtz successfully harnessed AI to disseminate his compositions via popular channels. Conversely, if abused, AI can significantly harm the careers and wellbeing of artists, producers, songwriters, and others associated with musical endeavors. Major entities often utilize renowned singers' voices to develop AI systems aimed at supplanting genuine performers, thereby belittling the hard work invested by dedicated professionals perfecting their art form.

To ensure just recompense for artists, the letter calls for businesses, platforms, and online music service providers to pledge against designing or implementing AI-generated music technologies, instruments, or material.

Recently, debates surrounding AI's influence on entertainment have gained momentum, culminating in legislative proceedings, litigation, labor disputes, and regulatory shifts. During 2023, Hollywood scribes staged walkouts opposing AI-manufactured content, whereas Spotify deleted AI mimicking real personalities. While purging all AI-produced music seems improbable, safeguarding appropriate payment for artists retains paramount importance.
