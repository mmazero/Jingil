Introduction

BlaBlaCar, the renowned carpooling and bus ticketing platform, has traveled an intriguing path since its inception. Founded in France, the company transformed from a modest online hitchhiking network to a successful startup, raising substantial funds and achieving unicorn status. Now, after expanding worldwide and reconsidering its goals for profitability, BlaBlaCar has announced securing a €100 million revolving credit facility, positioning itself for further expansion and potential acquisitions.

A Strategic Credit Facility and Acquisition Plans

Nicolas Brusson, BlaBlaCar's Co-Founder and CEO, recently revealed that the company has no immediate plans to draw upon the €100 million credit line provided by major banks in France, the UK, and the US. Instead, BlaBlaCar aims to utilize this debt facility to pursue strategic acquisitions, targeting smaller firms facing challenges amidst fundraising difficulties during turbulent economic times. By acquiring these businesses, BlaBlaCar intends to strengthen its market presence and bolster its user base.

Embracing Transparency and Achieving Profitability

Although BlaBlaCar remains privately held, recent developments indicate a shift towards greater transparency regarding key performance indicators (KPIs)—an essential aspect for investor relations and public trust. Significantly, BlaBlaCar reported reaching profitability in April 2022, marking a critical milestone following a challenging period for French startups. With €195 million in revenue generated in 2022 and over €250 million in 2023, representing nearly 30% YoY growth, BlaBlaCar demonstrates robust financial health. Importantly, BlaBlaCar distinguishes itself from other seemingly ""profitable"" companies by generating true net profits, unlike those solely reporting positive EBITDA figures without accounting for asset-associated expenses.

Global Expansion and Monetization Strategy

With approximately 80 million passengers utilizing BlaBlaCar services annually, the company boasts a strong global footprint spanning various markets. Notably, Brazil stands as the largest market outside France, while India is projected to surpass France in carpool rides soon. Although BlaBlaCar currently refrains from taking cuts on carpooling transactions in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey, it plans to gradually introduce booking fees to augment revenues and optimize resources.

Navigating Challenges in Russia

Despite having amassed millions of users in Russia prior to the invasion of Ukraine, BlaBlaCar made the decision to isolate its Russian operations entirely from the broader organization. However, instead of selling off the subsidiary, Brusson maintains that doing so would effectively hand over control to local ownership. Consequently, BlaBlaCar continues managing the Russian division separately, contributing minimally to overall revenue generation—just under 5%.

However, enhancing both efficiency and stability simultaneously remains a formidable challenge. In response to this hurdle, a team of scientists from the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE), led by Professor Ge Ziyi, made groundbreaking strides in developing highly efficient and stable binary OSCs using specially designed self-assembled molecules (SAMs). This breakthrough could pave the way for next-generation OSC technology.

The Challenge: Balancing Efficiency and Stability

Although poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) serves as a commonly used hole transporting material in high-efficiency OSCs, its inherent limitations hinder long-term performance. Specifically, PEDOT:PSS suffers from poor stability owing to its hydrophilicity and strong acidity. Thus, balancing efficiency and stability without compromising either aspect continues to present challenges in the realm of conventional OSCs.

The Solution: Custom-Designed Hole Transport Layers

To tackle these challenges head-on, the NIMTE research team devised innovative strategies involving tailored SAM structures. They successfully synthesized two novel asymmetric SAMs—BrCz and BrBACz—which feature asymmetrical backbones. By employing these custom-designed SAMs as hole-transporting layers (HTLs), they created binary OSC configurations built upon established systems like PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9.

Enhanced Performance Through Optimization

Upon integrating the newly engineered SAMs into binary OSCs, striking improvements emerged compared to conventional PEDOT:PSS-controlled counterparts. Notably, the incorporation of BrCz- and BrBACz-based HTLs resulted in higher transmittance, deeper work functions, and diminished surface energies. Consequently, the modified devices demonstrated improved charge extraction, augmented hole mobility, lowered interfacial resistances, and minimized carrier recombination.

Remarkable Results: Record-Breaking Performance & Unmatched Stability

Amongst all tested combinations, the BrBACz-controlled OSC delivered unprecedented results with a staggering PCE of 19.70%, accompanied by a remarkable current density of 29.20 mA cm−2 and a circuit voltage of 0.856 V. Impressively, this figure surpasses previously documented efficiencies for binary OSCs, setting a new record. Furthermore, when subjected to ambient air conditions (40 ± 5% humidity) and sustained illumination for 1,036 hours, the BrBACz-controlled device maintained approximately 95.0% of its initial efficiency, outperforming conventional OSCs regarding air stability.

Versatility Beyond Limits: Broad Adaptability Across Systems

Additionally, the exceptional merit of the BrBACz-controlled device extends beyond individual achievements, showcasing extraordinary versatility across various binary systems. When integrated with renowned pairs such as PM6:Y6, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9, the optimized device displayed commendable performance enhancement, further solidifying its potential applicability.

Conclusion

A significant development is currently unfolding in the world of open source software development, as seven major open source foundations join forces to establish common specifications and standards aligned with Europe's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). This joint initiative aims to streamline existing security best practices in open source software development, ensuring that the frequently criticized software supply chain meets the stringent requirements set forth by the incoming legislation.

Software Components and Liabilities
According to estimates, approximately 70% to 90% of modern software consists of open source components, with countless hours dedicated by independent programmers contributing to these projects without compensation. With the recent adoption of the CRA by the European Parliament, manufacturers of any internet-connected product must remain current with all relevant patches and security updates. Failure to comply may result in substantial penalties—fines reaching up to €15 million or 2.5% of annual global revenue.

In response to initial backlash from various sectors, including over a dozen open source industry groups, certain aspects of the CRA have evolved since its conception nearly two years ago. Primary among these alterations involves addressing potential liability concerns surrounding open source developers involved in commercial activities who previously feared facing litigation due to security flaws discovered in downstream applications utilizing their code contributions. Although the updated text offers immunity to those engaged solely in noncommercial endeavors, ambiguity remains regarding the definition of ""commercial activity."" Consequently, the seven open source foundations aim to address these challenges before the CRA takes full effect in 2027.

Addressing Inconsistent Documentation Practices
One recurring issue plaguing many open source projects relates to inconsistencies in documentation quality; such discrepancies hinder efforts to conduct thorough security audits and impede progress for downstream manufacturers and developers implementing tailored CRA procedures. While several well-established open source ventures possess robust best practice guidelines pertaining to areas like coordinated vulnerability disclosures and peer reviews, disparities persist amongst entities using varying techniques and jargon. To remedy this situation, these collaborating organizations strive to cultivate uniformity in security processes throughout the entire open source ecosystem.

Emerging Regulations Require Heightened Attention
Beyond the implications of the CRA, additional legislative measures such as the U.S.'s Securing Open Source Software Act necessitate increased vigilance and accountability from open source foundations and stakeholders alike. As stated by the Eclipse Foundation, ""legislation has introduced an urgent need for cybersecurity process standards,"" highlighting the importance of fostering tighter relationships and enhanced communication channels between key players operating within the software supply chain.

Spearheading this ambitious undertaking is the Eclipse Foundation itself, headquartered in Brussels and responsible for hosting hundreds of distinct open source projects encompassing diverse domains such as developer tools, frameworks, specifications, and beyond. Notably, members of the Eclipse Foundation boast prominent names in technology, namely Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat, and Oracle, further underscoring the significance of this groundbreaking alliance.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1473057239-e1712083727562.jpg?resize=1200,674",2024-04-02 18:55:48,"Unifying Cybersecurity Standards in Open Source Software Development for Enhanced Compliance: A Collaborative Approach to Meet CRA Requirements

In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), a significant breakthrough has emerged, challenging the conventional understanding of neural networks. A team of researchers from Meta's AI lab, MIT, Cisco Systems, and start-up Zyphra discovered that large sections of AI models, referred to as the ""lottery ticket hypothesis,"" could be removed without compromising the overall performance of the AI system. This finding has opened up new possibilities for optimizing AI, making it more efficient in terms of memory, energy use, and hardware requirements.

The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

The ""lottery ticket hypothesis"" was introduced in a 2019 paper by Jonathan Frankle and Michael Carbin, then at MIT, and is now gaining traction in the industry. The hypothesis suggests that massive AI programs contain smaller sections capable of performing the same tasks with fewer resources, thereby improving speed and reducing energy consumption.

Practical Applications: The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Deeper Layers

In a recent paper, the research team demonstrated the removal of up to half of Meta's open-source Llama 2 large language model, reducing memory usage by as much as 75%. This optimization allows the program to run on consumer-grade Nvidia or AMD GPUs instead of requiring a massive server rack.

The researchers, Andrey Gromov and colleagues, titled their paper ""The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers"" and posted it on the arXiv pre-print server. They found that eliminating half of Llama 2's layers had minimal impact on downstream performance, suggesting that these layers contributed little to the final output.

Imagining a Neural Network as a Marching Band

To better understand this concept, consider a neural network as rows of musicians in a marching band. The front row might consist of smaller brass instruments, such as trumpets, while the middle would have trombones and tubas. At the back, the deep part, would be percussion instruments like drums and cymbals.

Gromov and team observed that removing the ""deep"" layers, or the percussion and some tubas, had minimal impact on the overall sound produced by the band.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/29ec269e70d1964b9e49bb16a113690c9d09db15/2024/04/02/c5761718-38fc-4610-8112-2201ea13f464/bandplayingscreenshot-2024-04-02-143402.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-02 00:00:00,"Discover the unreasonable ineffectiveness of deep layers in AI!

By incorporating keywords such as ""UV-emitting"" and ""marine biofilm,"" the title becomes more appealing to search engines and users looking for content related to those terms.","Title: Revolutionary UV-Emitting Glass: A Game Changer in Underwater Biofilm Mitigation

Introduction

Imagine a world where underwater surfaces remain consistently clean and free from harmful biofilms, without the need for harsh chemicals or constant maintenance. This vision is now one step closer to reality, thanks to a groundbreaking invention by a team of engineers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They have developed an ultra-violet (UV) ray-emitting glass that significantly reduces biofilm growth on submerged surfaces, offering a promising solution to a problem that costs the US Navy alone between $180 and $260 million each year.

What is Biofilm?

Before delving into the innovative aspects of this new glass, let us first understand what biofilm entails. Essentially, it refers to a slimy layer of assorted microorganisms that adhere to damp surfaces. According to Mariana Lanzarini-Lopes, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at UMass Amherst, if you were to examine the inner side of your kitchen sink, the slippery film you would encounter is indeed biofilm.

Understanding the Impact of Biofilm

In marine settings, biofilm poses substantial challenges. It contributes to increased drag and fuel consumption in underwater vehicles due to additional weight, leading to higher operational expenses. Furthermore, it exacerbates corrosion damage in both ships and oceanographic instruments. Additionally, biofilm can obscure windowpanes intended for cameras and other sensory devices requiring transparency, facilitating the transportation of invasive species across vast bodies of water.

Existing Solutions and Their Drawbacks

Present countermeasures against biofilm typically involve employing chemical compounds like antibacterial layers designed to eliminate microbes or nonslick coatings meant to impede biofilms from initially forming. Regrettably, these strategies often carry detrimental ecological impacts and tend to lose effectiveness over time.

Introducing UV-Emitting Glass: A Novel Approach

Seeking a sustainable alternative, the UMass Amherst team devised a method harnessing UVC radiation – the shortest and most potent wavelength of UV radiation available – to create biofilm-resistant glass. Previously, Lopes' laboratory successfully utilized UV side-emitting optical fibers capable of disseminating UVC radiation via narrow conduits, eradicating hazardous organisms and averting bacterial accumulation on internal components of medical apparatus, domestic appliances, and water conveyance structures.

Overcoming Challenges in Applying UV Radiation Underwater

Applying conventional UV light sources to illuminate expansive underwater regions presents complications; namely, diminishing intensity as distance from the origin increases and interference caused by turbid surroundings. Addressing these concerns, the researchers applied a unique strategy involving scattering UV rays internally using a nanosilica coating affixed to the glass exterior. With this setup, once UV enters the glass, it scatters from within toward the outer section through interaction with light-diffusing nanoparticles. Notably, unlike typical materials, the silica does not retain UV rays, allowing them to persistently reflect and traverse the glass interior. Consequently, this generates an evenly lit glass surface impervious to unequal UV ray distribution, thereby denying biofilm-generative microorganisms potential attachment sites.

Testing and Results

Collaborating with Florida Institute of Technology and the Navy, the research team submerged the UV-emitting glass prototype in Port Canaveral, Florida's coastal waters for twenty days. Comparatively, untreated glass exhibited prominent biofilm development, whereas the cutting-edge material showcased a remarkable 98% decrease in visible biofilm proliferation.

Applications and Future Directions

According to Alidokht, contrary to external UV sterilization techniques, the novel glass inherently restrains biofilm formation since the surface acts as a self-contained UVC source. In turn, this breakthrough innovation paves the way for extensive disinfection opportunities encompassing transparent surfaces such as aquatic vehicle portholes, floating globes, anchored buoys, observation decks, submarine viewpoints, undersea cables, and monitoring instrument optics. Moreover, given its successful resistance to biofilm colonization (also known as biofouling), further investigation aims to explore long-lasting implementations, evaluate potential ecological consequences, and fabricate larger surface dimensions.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-team-creates-3.jpg,2024-04-02 16:32:33,"Meta Description: Discover UMass Amherst's revolutionary UV-emitting glass, mitigating underwater biofilm growth without harsh chemicals.

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in natural language processing through large language models (LLMs). These models, which power popular tools like Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Bing AI, and ChatGPT, can generate plausible text, images, or code based on user input. While these advancements offer exciting possibilities across various sectors, the application of LLMs in cybersecurity remains a tantalizing yet largely unexplored frontier. This article delves into a collaborative study between Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and OpenAI, emphasizing the importance of thoroughly evaluating LLMs before incorporating them into cybersecurity operations. By adopting a comprehensive assessment strategy, organizations can effectively leverage LLMs to augment their defensive capabilities against increasingly sophisticated threats.

Understanding LLMs and Their Potential Role in Cybersecurity

Large language models rely on deep learning techniques trained on vast datasets, enabling them to produce outputs that closely mirror human-generated content. In the context of cybersecurity, the potential applications of LLMs span various domains, including threat analysis, vulnerability detection, incident response, and digital forensics. However, understanding the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs in these areas requires rigorous examination beyond mere theoretical knowledge.

Researchers at UNC-Chapel Hill use semiconductors & artificial photosynthesis to turn CO2 into fuel, improving efficiency and selectively reducing harmful greenhouse gases.","Title: Harnessing the Power of the Sun: Turning Carbon Dioxide into Fuel with Semiconductors

Introduction

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from the University of North Carolina (UNC)-Chapel Hill Chemistry Department are leveraging the power of semiconductors to convert sunlight into high-energy compounds. This pioneering research has the potential to create environmentally friendly fuels by transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into less harmful greenhouse gases and valuable fuel precursors.

The Research: Artificial Photosynthesis and Methyl Termination

The UNC-Chapel Hill team's work, published in ACS Energy Letters, focuses on methyl termination—a process that uses a simple organic compound, one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms, to modify the surface of silicon. Silicon is a crucial component in solar cells, and this modification enhances its performance in converting CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO) using sunlight.

This research is inspired by artificial photosynthesis, a process that mimics how plants convert CO2 into energy-rich molecules using sunlight. The goal is to store solar power in the form of liquid fuels that can be used when solar energy is not readily available.

Last year saw a staggering 400% increase in IoT and Operational Technology (OT) malware attacks. Manufacturing industries bore the brunt of these assaults, accounting for 54.5% of all attacks while experiencing approximately 6,000 weekly attacks across all monitored devices. Infamous Mirai and Gafgyt botnets drove most of the activity, responsible for 66% of attack payloads. These botnets enslave IoT devices to execute devastating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, resulting in colossal financial damages.

Dark Web Trade in IoT Attacks

With adversaries increasingly capitalizing on the burgeoning IoT device market, selling IoT ransomware toolkits has become a thriving illegal enterprise. On numerous dark web forums, analysts discovered over 700 listings for DDoS attack services in the first six months of last year alone. Prices vary depending upon factors like CAPTCHA, DDoS protection, and JavaScript verification on the victim's end, ranging between $20 daily to $10,000 monthly. Typically, such services cost around $63.50 daily and $1,350 monthly.

Highlighted IoT Ransomware Variants

Among the myriad IoT ransomware strains, several have gained notoriety. One example is DeadBolt, which leverages CVE-2022-27593 to encrypt user files before demanding payment for a decryption key, primarily attacking QNAP Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices. Other prominent variants include WannaCry, targeting IoT devices using weaknesses in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, as well as Mirai, Linux.Encoder.1, Gafgyt, Reaper, Hajime, BrickerBot, and BASHLITE.

Rising Incidence of Industrial Company Targeting

Alarmingly, ransomware incidents involving manufacturers, utilities, and other industrial firms surged 50% last year. Rob Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Dragos, noted that manufacturers faced the highest frequency of attacks since compromising the profit-generating segments of these enterprises incentivizes victims to swiftly settle ransoms.

Zero Trust: An Effective Defense

Implementing a Zero Trust approach bolsters defenses surrounding IoT sensors and associated Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Core aspects of Zero Trust that contribute to enhanced IoT device security include:

1. Real-time monitoring and scanning of network traffic—Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), alongside Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), aim to identify attempted breaches promptly. Recent developments in SIEM and CSPM facilitate simpler analysis of corporate networks and detection of potentially insecure configurations or suspicious activities.
2. Microsegmentation—This strategy divides larger networks into smaller sections, restricting lateral movement across the environment, thereby reducing the scope of possible intrusions.
3. Least privilege principle—Grant minimal access necessary for users, processes, and devices to perform tasks, thus limiting damage potential in case of a successful breach.
4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)—Layered authentication methods strengthen identity validation, minimizing the likelihood of unauthorized access.

Conclusion

Introduction

In an intriguing revelation, Anthropic researchers have discovered a novel method of ""jailbreaking"" large language models (LLMs), enabling them to generate harmful or inappropriate responses. Dubbed ""many-shot jailbreaking,"" this technique convinces LLMs to perform tasks they are not initially designed to do, such as providing instructions on building harmful devices. This blog post will delve into the details of this newfound vulnerability and its implications for AI security.

The Emergence of a New Vulnerability

The latest generation of LLMs boasts an increased ""context window,"" which refers to the amount of data these models can retain in their short-term memory. Earlier models could only store a few sentences, but the current ones can handle thousands of words or even entire books. This expanded context window has led to the discovery of many-shot jailbreaking, a phenomenon where LLMs become more likely to comply with inappropriate requests after being exposed to a series of less harmful queries.

In-Context Learning and Its Unexpected Consequences

Anthropic researchers found that LLMs with large context windows perform better when there are numerous examples of a task within the prompt. This ""in-context learning"" allows the models to improve their responses over time, even for tasks they might have initially gotten wrong. However, in an unexpected twist, this learning mechanism also extends to inappropriate questions.

When LLMs are presented with a sequence of innocuous queries, they gradually ""activate"" their latent knowledge relevant to the user's requests. In the case of trivia questions, the model becomes better at providing accurate answers as more questions are asked. Surprisingly, the same mechanism applies when users ask for inappropriate responses, making the model more likely to comply with harmful requests after a series of less harmful ones.

Mitigation Efforts and Future Directions

Upon discovering this vulnerability, Anthropic researchers immediately informed their peers and competitors, promoting a culture of transparency in AI security. They hope that openly sharing exploits will encourage collaboration and the development of more secure LLMs.

In terms of mitigation, Anthropic found that simply limiting the context window is not an ideal solution, as it negatively impacts the model's performance. Instead, they are working on classifying and contextualizing queries before they reach the model, ensuring that inappropriate requests are properly handled. While this approach may introduce new models to ""fool,"" it represents an expected step in the ongoing AI security race.

Conclusion

The many-shot jailbreaking vulnerability unveiled by Anthropic researchers highlights the need for continued diligence in ensuring the safety and security of LLMs. By fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration, the AI community can work together to address these challenges and develop more robust and secure models for the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1424498694.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-02 20:33:58,"Meta Description: Discover how ""many-shot jailbreaking"" enables large language models to generate harmful responses & learn mitigation efforts.

At the heart of this groundbreaking development resides the Hybrid Closed Loop System—an ingenious fusion of two primary components designed to work harmoniously together. Firstly, a discreet sensor is gently placed just below the skin's surface, diligently monitoring real-time glucose levels at predetermined intervals. Secondly, the gathered data is then transmitted wirelessly to a compact external pump, responsible for administering precise insulin dosages when necessary. However, despite being predominantly automated, users must still contribute minimal manual inputs such as carbohydrate consumption information to optimize performance.

Broadening Accessibility through Public Funding

While comparable technologies have emerged elsewhere – notably by Tandem in the United States following FDA authorization in 2019 and iLet securing similar approvals last year – one crucial distinction sets England's initiative apart; namely, its implementation via the country's universally accessible public healthcare system. In contrast to existing arrangements wherein access remains largely confined to those who can afford private insurance coverage, this new endeavor promises to extend opportunities equitably across social strata. Such inclusivity represents a monumental shift in prioritizing widespread availability over exclusivity, ultimately ensuring that no individual grappling with type 1 diabetes gets left behind.

A Precise Countdown to Transformation

To emphasize the sheer magnitude of this transformative undertaking, the NHS provided an astonishingly accurate estimate of 269,095 people in England currently living with type 1 diabetes – all prospective beneficiaries of this large-scale deployment. As local branches commence identification procedures for eligible candidates beginning today, anticipation continues to mount among stakeholders and patients alike.

Colette Marshall, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, expressed her enthusiasm in the official press release: ""Diabetes is an arduous and unrelenting condition, yet these innovative systems bring forth substantial, life-altering improvements to both the holistic health and everyday lives of affected individuals."" She went on to describe this announcement as a historic milestone, pledging collaboration efforts alongside the NHS and other invested parties to guarantee swift distribution and equal opportunity for everyone requiring assistance.

Tableau, a business intelligence and data analytics tool, has had multiple iterations of tools that enable varying degrees of natural language queries and AI-powered insights as well. However, Einstein Copilot for Tableau stands out as an actual assistant to help users with data analysis and data exploration operations.

The interface is driven by feedback, enabling users to identify if the recommendations were helpful or if more is needed. Multiple user studies that Tableau has done found that people are more likely to use a feature if there is an easy way to submit feedback about it.

To help users prepare data for analysis, Tableau also has data preparation capabilities as part of the core platform. One of the toughest things for a new data analyst is often figuring out how to create data calculations, which is now an area where Einstein Copilot for Tableau can help.

Writing an email with gen AI isn't the same as doing data analysis, and Salesforce has already been deploying Einstein Copilot for CRM. However, the Tableau capability has been trained and optimized for a specific use case. With Tableau, the context for how the data is going to be used is not just about CRM but could be used for any type of data analysis.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/meta-again-denies-that-netflix-read-users-private-facebook-messages/,Meta (again) denies that Netflix read users' private Facebook messages, Netflix's Access to Private Facebook Messages Denied by Meta: Court Filing ,"Meta has denied that it granted Netflix access to users' private messages, claiming that the company only had programmatic access to Facebook's inbox API and that it never used this access to read private messages. The allegations were made in a court filing in a class-action lawsuit over data privacy practices between a group of consumers and the parent company of Facebook. Netflix and Facebook had a ""special relationship,"" with Facebook cutting spending on its own video service, Facebook Watch, to avoid competing with Netflix, a large Facebook advertiser. The claim references a document that emerged in the discovery process of the lawsuit. The document alleged that Netflix had access to Meta's ""Titan API,"" which allowed the streamer to integrate with Facebook's messaging app. In exchange for this access, Netflix agreed to provide Meta with a ""written report every two weeks"" with information about its recommendation sends and recipient clicks and agreed to keep the API agreement confidential. By 2015, Netflix was spending $40 million on Facebook ads, and by 2017, it had agreed to spend $150 million on Facebook ads and provide cross-device intent signals. Netflix and Facebook maintained a close relationship, with former Netflix CEO Reed Hastings having direct communications with Facebook executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg, Communications VP Elliot Schrage, and CTO Andrew Bosworth. The claim that Netflix had access to users' private messages has raised concerns about the privacy of Facebook users. However, Meta has denied these claims and stated that Netflix only had access to Facebook's inbox API, which allowed users to message their friends about what they were watching on Netflix directly from the Netflix app.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/meta-distorted-glitched.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-02 19:09:22,"""Discover the truth about Netflix and Facebook's data privacy.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making waves across various industries, offering limitless opportunities for innovation. However, this advancement may have severe consequences for the music industry. Recently, more than 200 artists, including music legends and rising stars, signed an open letter warning about the potential dangers AI poses to music.

The open letter, spearheaded by the Artist Rights Alliance, calls for AI developers, technology companies, platforms, and digital music services to cease the use of AI to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists. Signatories include Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, the estates of Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra, Billie Eilish, Jon Bon Jovi, Smokey Robinson, and many more.

The letter highlights the unauthorized use of artist voices to train AI, which is seen as an ""assault on human creativity."" This practice not only violates artists' rights but also threatens their livelihoods. AI has the potential to both advance creativity and undermine it, as our own David Gewirtz demonstrated when he used AI to publish his music on major services.

Major companies have been using artist voices to train AI, with the intent of replacing human artists. This predatory use of AI can lead to a race to the bottom, degrading the value of artists' work and preventing them from being fairly compensated. The letter urges companies, platforms, and digital music services to pledge not to develop or deploy AI-generated music technology, tools, or content.

The issue of AI in entertainment has become increasingly contentious in recent years. In 2024, it was discussed at Congressional hearings and inspired a new law in Tennessee meant to protect artists. In 2023, Hollywood screenwriters went on strike over AI-generated content, and streaming platform Spotify decided to remove AI-generated content mimicking real voices.

While AI-generated music is unlikely to disappear, it's crucial to ensure that artists are fairly compensated for their work. As AI continues to evolve, striking a balance between innovation and protecting artists' rights is essential. This will involve ongoing discussions, legislation, and commitments from companies and platforms to respect the value of human creativity.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/48e24404db64d2ff95a8af9ca3b1f712a1954aa4/2024/04/02/286d31a4-7b19-456e-9073-4a5d3fc79d72/rovotmusicgettyimages-1471299905.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-02 12:38:00,"Meta Description:
