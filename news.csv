The Future of Wireless: Bending Light Around Obstacles

In the realm of wireless communication, we stand on the brink of a transformative leap. As our current cellular networks and Wi-Fi systems nudge closer to their bandwidth ceilings, the quest for broader frequencies is paramount. The answer lies in the untapped potential of terahertz waves, poised to carry data at rates 100 times that of today's microwaves.

Yet, this advancement is not without its challenges. Terahertz signals, unlike their microwave counterparts, are stymied by solid barriers, demanding an unobstructed path between sender and receiver. This requirement has long been a stumbling block—until now.

A groundbreaking study by researchers from Brown University and Rice University, published in Communications Engineering, unveils a pioneering technique to navigate this hurdle: curving light around obstructions. This innovation could catapult wireless communication into a new era, where terahertz frequencies reign supreme.

Imagine a Wi-Fi base station today; it bathes a room in signals, ensuring connectivity regardless of your location within. Daniel Mittleman, a leading figure from Brown's School of Engineering, explains that with terahertz frequencies, the scenario changes dramatically. Connectivity would rely on a focused beam, tracking your movements to maintain the link. Any obstruction, and the signal fades.

The solution? Self-accelerating beams. These are not your ordinary waves; they possess the unique ability to curve autonomously as they travel. By harnessing this property, the researchers have crafted transmitters capable of directing electromagnetic waves with precision. When an obstacle looms, the signal deftly shifts, maintaining an unbroken connection.

This method doesn't just circumvent blockages; it redefines the approach to wireless network reliability. Hichem Guerboukha, the study's lead and now an assistant professor at the University of Missouri—Kansas City, asserts that while not a panacea for all interference issues, this strategy outperforms previous attempts.

Through meticulous simulations and real-world trials, the team has substantiated their claims. Their vision is clear: a future where wireless networks thrive, unhampered by the clutter of our modern environments. Offices and urban landscapes, often riddled with signal-disrupting obstacles, could witness a surge in internet stability and speed.

As we edge closer to realizing this vision, the implications are profound. A world where data flows unhindered, where connectivity is a given, and where the invisible highways of information are as robust as they are invisible.

Whistleblowers Accuse Faraday Future of Misrepresentation and Retaliation

Two former employees of Faraday Future, an embattled electric vehicle (EV) start-up, have recently filed lawsuits claiming that the company has falsified sales figures and engaged in retaliatory practices against whistleblowers. The plaintiffs, Jose Guerrero and Victoria Xie, allege wrongful termination, breach of contract, and infliction of emotional distress. Additionally, they argue that Faraday Future's founder, Jia Yueting, maintains undue influence over the company despite being sidelined due to an internal investigation.

Falsification of Sales Figures and Retaliation Claims

In their respective lawsuits, Guerrero and Xie accuse Faraday Future of lying about several sales of its flagship electric SUV, the FF91. According to the whistleblowers, the company announced these sales prematurely—before the completion of the sales process. Furthermore, they allege that most of these transactions remained partially or entirely unpaid even after the public announcement. In response to objections raised by sales personnel regarding these questionable sales tactics, management, under Jia's direction, reportedly threatened and subjected dissenting employees to adverse human resources actions.

Additionally, Guerrero and Xie claim that Faraday Future sold its early customer vehicles without conducting mandatory pre-delivery inspections. This alleged practice raises questions about the condition of the delivered units and may potentially violate consumer protection laws. Moreover, the plaintiffs state that the company installed ""non-road approved software"" in customer vehicles, neglecting to inform relevant authorities like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Such behavior might represent a violation of federal regulations such as the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act.

Loss of Employment and Legal Countermeasures

As a consequence of raising awareness about these concerning business practices, both Guerrero and Xie faced employment repercussions. Xie was dismissed from the company merely two days following submission of her internal whistleblower report; meanwhile, Guerrero received his termination notice on January 18. Both individuals subsequently initiated legal proceedings, pursuing justice via arbitration filings. However, owing to the company's failure to settle associated costs and meet deadlines, they ultimately resorted to submitting separate lawsuits in the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Unresolved Issues Surrounding Founder Control

A significant source of friction inside Faraday Future revolves around Jia's ongoing involvement in the company's affairs. Despite stepping away from day-to-day operations in 2022 amidst an internal review, the lawsuit contends that Jia still wields considerable authority behind closed doors. These revelations emerge as Faraday Future grapples with financial troubles, SEC and DOJ investigations, and struggles to maintain occupancy of its LA headquarters due to outstanding rental obligations.

Founder Jia vehemently denies the accusations levied against him, threatening to take legal action against the involved parties. Meanwhile, Faraday Future issued a formal statement asserting confidence in its defense against the litigation and expressing support for its employees during this challenging period.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-team-explores-subterranean-storage-hydrogen.html,Team explores the subterranean storage of hydrogen, Storing Carbon-Free Hydrogen in Depleted Oil Reservoirs: A Feasible Solution? ,"Title: Transforming Depleted Oil Reservoirs into Carbon-Free Hydrogen Storage: A Viable Solution?

Introduction

Imagine harnessing the potential of vast subterranean sandstone reserves, previously filled with oil and natural gas, now repurposed to store a different kind of carbon-free fuel – hydrogen. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are employing cutting-edge computer simulations and lab experiments to explore the possibility of utilizing depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs for storing climate-neutral hydrogen fuel. With its capacity to generate electricity, power industries, and even serve as a fuel source for cars, hydrogen emerges as a promising candidate in the quest for cleaner energy alternatives. Furthermore, surplus hydrogen can be stored for extended periods, providing valuable backup during times when renewable energy production dwindles.

The Challenge: Storing Hydrogen Efficiently

Although hydrogen offers numerous benefits, one significant challenge remains—it requires immense volumes to match the energy provided by conventional fossil fuels, making traditional aboveground storage methods impractical. To tackle this issue, scientists like Matthew Paul and Tuan Ho are investigating the suitability of subsurface geological formations for hydrogen storage. Their primary focus involves understanding the behavior of hydrogen in porous rock structures similar to those commonly observed in oil and natural gas reservoirs.

Exploring Underground Storage Options

While salt caverns represent one possible option for storing hydrogen, they are not universally available throughout the United States. As such, researchers are examining alternative options, including depleted oil and gas reservoirs. In particular, Ho's team aims to address concerns surrounding the risk of hydrogen becoming trapped within rock pores, seeping out, or becoming tainted.

A Twofold Approach: Leakage and Contamination Risks

To evaluate the likelihood of hydrogen leakage, Ho's team analyzed the properties of two prevalent rock types involved in oil and gas formation—sandstone and shale. While sandstone typically comprises larger mineral and rock fragments pressed together over time, shale consists primarily of fine clay-rich mineral particles. Interestingly, shale can act as an effective barrier, preventing hydrogen migration beyond designated storage zones.

Upon analyzing experimental data gathered by colleagues at the University of Oklahoma, Ho discovered that up to 10% of hydrogen remained trapped within the shale specimens following extraction attempts. Computer simulations further corroborated these observations, suggesting that hydrogen molecules do not readily penetrate certain clays frequently encountered in shale formations. Consequently, minimal losses occur due to entrapment or movement through clay barriers.

In addition to evaluating leakage risks, Ho's team also investigated the potential for contaminants to affect hydrogen purity during storage. Experiments revealed that residual natural gas present in depleted natural gas reservoirs may mix with incoming hydrogen supplies, potentially releasing trace quantities of carbon dioxide upon combustion. Further studies are underway to assess the impact of residual oil in depleted oil reservoirs on hydrogen quality and safety.

Conclusion

As the world continues to seek viable solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, innovations in clean energy storage assume critical importance. By exploring the potential of depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs for carbon-free hydrogen storage, researchers like Tuan Ho contribute significantly to advancing our knowledge and capabilities in sustainable energy management.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/edps-gdpr-principles-attacks/,"As AI accelerates, Europe's flagship privacy principles are under attack, warns EDPS", EDPS Warns: AI Threatens Europe's GDPR Privacy Principles ,"THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION REGIME FACES STIFF CHALLENGES FROM INDUSTRY LOBBYISTS

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiórowski, issued a stark warning recently about the impending threats to the bedrock principles of Europe's data protection and privacy regime. According to him, the cornerstone elements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are under assault from various quarters, notably industry lobbyists. These groups pose a severe threat to the GDPR's guiding principles such as data minimization and purpose limitation. This article delves deeper into these concerns and explores what the future holds for the EU's data protection landscape.

THE CRUX OF THE MATTER: GDPR PRINCIPLES UNDER FIRE
---------------------------------------------------

During a recent interaction with members of the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee, Wiewiórowski expressed concern about intensifying efforts to undermine two crucial GDPR principles – data minimization and purpose limitation. Specifically, he pointed out that the concept of ""purpose limitation"" would likely come under scrutiny during the upcoming debates in the new parliament.

Purpose limitation refers to the idea that each data activity must align with a particular objective. While further data usage might be feasible, it often necessitates securing consent from the individual concerned or establishing another legitimate justification. By incorporating deliberate obstacles into data activities, the purpose limitation philosophy aims to safeguard users' privacy rights. However, certain industries view this as an impediment to seamless data utilization, leading them to challenge its legitimacy.

PREPARING FOR A SEISMIC SHIFT
------------------------------

With elections to the European Parliament scheduled for June and the Commission's term set to expire at the end of 2024, seismic shifts lie ahead for the EU's political landscape. As a consequence, alterations in approach by newly-elected legislators could significantly impact the bloc's stringent standards for protecting citizens' digital assets.

According to Wiewiórowski, many incoming parliamentarians lack hands-on experience crafting and implementing pivotal data protection measures such as the GDPR due to natural turnover in electoral cycles. Consequently, they may harbor doubts regarding the continued relevance of the GDPR in contemporary society. Predictably, intense discussions around revising existing regulations appear inevitable once the freshly constituted parliament begins its tenure.

LOBBYING EFFORTS AND RESEARCH LIMITATIONS
-----------------------------------------

Industry advocacy campaigns formidably contribute to mounting pressure on GDPR principles. Business entities vehemently argue against restrictions imposed by the purpose limitation clause, insisting that it hampers innovation and growth. They advocate for greater flexibility in repurposing user data without explicit approval or additional legal grounds.

Moreover, segments of the scientific community regard purpose limitations as constraints hindering academic pursuits. Researchers maintain that stringent adherence to this rule thwarts serendipitous discoveries arising from exploring diverse applications for acquired data sets. In essence, critics claim that maintaining rigid boundaries stifles creativity and limits opportunities for groundbreaking advancements across multiple disciplines.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIVACY STANDARDS
----------------------------------

Should GDPR's purpose limitation and data minimization principles succumb to industry lobbying, far-reaching consequences would ensue for regional privacy norms. Established as pioneers in enacting sweeping data protection policies, the EU currently boasts robust privacy guidelines rivaled by few jurisdictions worldwide. Nevertheless, diluting these fundamental principles could precipitate a decline in privacy protections throughout the continent. Despite global admiration for the GDPR, several countries have adopted similar yet less stringent regimes, potentially emboldening proponents of laxer enforcement.

COMPLYING WITH GDPR VERSUS DEVELOPING AI MODELS
-----------------------------------------------

An escalating tension exists between complying with GDPR obligations and nurturing cutting-edge AI technologies requiring vast amounts of data for model training. OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, grapples with numerous GDPR compliance issues and faces ongoing investigations concerning the legal basis asserted for processing individuals' data during model development.

While addressing reporters at a luncheon briefing following the release of the EDPS's annual report, Wiewiórowski refrained from pinning the blame solely on burgeoning generative AI tools for jeopardizing the GDPR's purpose limitation principle. Nonetheless, he acknowledged AI as one of the primary hurdles confronting Europe's data protection watchdogs amid rapid technological evolution.

LOOMING TECHNOLOGICAL HURDLES
-----------------------------

Anticipating forthcoming difficulties posed by novel technologies, Wiewiórowski cautioned that issues linked to artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience would dominate regulatory priorities for the next half-decade. Although he conceded that the present wave of AI advances does not qualify as a full-blown technological revolution, he emphasized the importance of recognizing the accelerated pace of innovation brought upon by the mass availability of advanced tools. Furthermore, Wiewiórowski noted that periods of volatility, exemplified by the conflict in Ukraine, tend to catalyze technological progression at an unprecedented rate.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1271697775.jpg?resize=1200,708",2024-04-09 15:56:46,"Read about the challenges facing GDPR's core principles!

Fluctuating solar energy poses a challenge to green hydrogen production device durability. Researchers from KIST create a novel evaluation technique utilizing real solar irradiance data, improving material lifespan and precision in determining replacement timings.","Title: A Revolutionary Solar-Based Durability Evaluation Technique for Green Hydrogen Production

Introduction

The global energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, with a shift towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. Green hydrogen, produced through renewable energy-powered electrolysis of water, is emerging as a promising candidate for a future clean energy carrier. Among the various renewable energy options, solar energy has the advantage of being widely available, with low dependence on natural topography. However, fluctuations in solar output due to factors such as season and weather can lead to repetitive increases and decreases in power, posing a challenge to the durability of production devices. To address this issue, a team of researchers from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has developed a cutting-edge durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices using real solar irradiance data.

The Challenge of Solar Fluctuations

Solar energy is a highly promising renewable energy source for green hydrogen production, thanks to its wide availability and low environmental impact. However, solar output is subject to fluctuations due to factors such as season, weather, and time of day. These fluctuations can lead to repetitive increases and decreases in power, potentially damaging the components of production devices and reducing their lifespan. Therefore, precise evaluation of the durability of devices under power fluctuations is crucial for determining the optimal timing for component replacement and developing new materials.

Existing durability evaluation methods have not accurately reflected solar output variability, relying solely on simple methods such as periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Moreover, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions.

A Novel Durability Evaluation Technique

To address these challenges, the research team from KIST, led by Dr. Bora Seo and Director Yoon Seok-jin, has developed a durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices using actual solar irradiance data. This method involves converting irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data obtained from solar panels and water electrolysis stack data, enabling the most accurate simulation of fluctuations in actual solar energy output.

Introduction:

Elon Musk's recent decision to prioritize a robotaxi project over an affordable electric vehicle (EV) has raised some eyebrows in the industry. This move could potentially impact Tesla's position as a leader in the EV market. Let's delve into the implications of this strategic shift.

Body:

Tesla's Early Days vs. Today

In its initial stages, Tesla took bold risks, making ambitious bets that paid off handsomely. However, times have changed. With revenues nearing $100 billion and net profits of $15 billion in 2021, Tesla is no longer the underdog. As a major player in the auto manufacturing sector, its focus has shifted towards improving efficiency and productivity metrics.

The Cancelled Affordable EV Project

Reports suggested that Tesla was about to commence the development of a $25,000 EV in their Texas plant during the second half of 2025. A budget-friendly EV would have substantially expanded Tesla's target market and provided competition against anticipated low-cost Chinese EVs. Nevertheless, constructing a new production line presented challenges similar to those faced during the Model 3 rollout—an endeavor notorious for its difficulties.

Robotaxis: Fun Yet Challenging

While the prospect of developing robotaxis excites Musk, achieving full autonomy poses considerable hurdles. Currently, Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems only operate at Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision. Moreover, despite AI advancements, doubts remain whether these technologies will mature swiftly enough to deliver a game-changing product soon.

Organizational Considerations

Ideally, spinning off a separate division dedicated solely to robotaxis would allow for greater focus. However, due to his substantial stake in Tesla shares, Musk may prefer maintaining control rather than entrusting others with leadership duties. Alternatively, establishing a smaller ""skunkworks"" team within Tesla could promote innovation without diverting too much attention away from Musk. Regrettably, past experiences indicate that Musk tends to involve himself deeply in various aspects of the business, leaving little room for such independent units.

Conclusion:

Ultimately, Tesla's board members need to engage in serious discussions regarding the company's future direction. Their apparent alignment with Musk's vision may hinder diverse perspectives essential for informed decision-making. Failing to consider alternative strategies could risk losing Tesla's hard-earned prominence in the competitive landscape of the evolving EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1232815520.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-09 19:35:54,"""Discover the future of EVs: Tesla's shift from affordable cars to robotaxis.

Introduction:

General Motors' (GM) autonomous vehicle division, Cruise, has recently announced a significant shift in its operations. Following a five-month pause, Cruise will gradually restart its services, albeit with a twist—the robotaxis will be driven manually, without autonomous capabilities. This decision marks a notable change in direction for the company, which previously focused on rapid expansion across various US cities. Let's delve deeper into Cruise's new approach and what this means for the future of autonomous transportation.

Back to Basics:

After suspending its autonomous operations due to a controversial incident in San Francisco, Cruise seems to be shifting gears towards a more conservative growth strategy. Instead of prioritizing quick expansion, the company now emphasizes gathering essential data through manual driving to improve their Autonomous Vehicles (AV). By doing so, Cruise aims to collect precise location details, enabling the AV to better comprehend its surroundings and navigate safely.

Addressing Previous Challenges:

This strategic reset may raise questions regarding whether Cruise is merely highlighting fundamental aspects of developing a self-driving car business or fundamentally changing its technological approach. Former CEO Kyle Vogt stated in 2022 that Cruise had ""de-risked"" its tech solution; however, recurring operational issues and regulatory scrutiny suggest otherwise. As such, the current modifications might reflect a reassessment of previous strategies, focusing on enhanced safety measures and transparency.

Regaining Trust Through Improved Communication:

Following the unfortunate events of last year, Cruise faces challenges beyond just technical improvements. The company must regain trust from regulators, consumers, and local communities. To achieve this goal, Cruise promises to implement revised incident response and crisis management protocols. Additionally, collaborations with first responder units in every district where Cruise intends to launch operations aim to foster open communication channels and promote smoother integration with emergency services.

Future Plans Unclear:

Although Cruise has detailed its immediate focus on mapping and data collection using human-driven vehicles, no official announcements have been made concerning resuming driverless operations. With historical roots primarily in San Francisco, Cruise must overcome regulatory hurdles and rebuild its reputation before considering a return to its initial home base. Meanwhile, competitors like Alphabet's Waymo continue to expand their driverless offerings in major metropolitan areas, putting additional pressure on Cruise to innovate and adapt.

Conclusion:

Cruise's recent announcement signifies a turning point for the company, demonstrating its commitment to addressing past concerns while working diligently towards safer and more reliable autonomy solutions.

This summary highlights the development of advanced optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy descriptor model. These novel controllers enhance performance in complex nonlinear systems like the rotary inverted pendulum, offering improved stability, shorter settling times, and effective handling of parameter variations.","Title: Harnessing the Power of Fuzzy Logic: A New Era of Nonlinear Control Systems

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous, playing a crucial role in various fields, from robotics to economics. However, their inherent complexity makes mathematical modeling and control challenging. Enter the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system, a powerful tool that uses fuzzy logic to simplify the control of nonlinear systems.

Fuzzy logic, a form of mathematical logic, allows for truth values between 0 and 1, rather than the traditional binary system of true (1) or false (0). This flexibility enables the T–S fuzzy system to approximate nonlinear systems as multiple linear systems, making them easier to model and control. The Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC) method, derived from the T–S fuzzy system, has become a popular control strategy for nonlinear systems.

Building on this foundation, researchers have developed the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS), which combines the T–S fuzzy system with the space-state representation. This powerful combination describes a physical system in terms of state, input, and output variables. Despite extensive research on FDS, optimal control strategies remain largely unexplored, with robust control methods introducing additional complexity and optimization challenges.

To address these limitations, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from Shibaura Institute of Technology and including Thi-Van-Anh Nguyen, Quy-Thinh Dao, and Duc-Binh Pham from Hanoi University of Science and Technology developed novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model. Their study, published in Scientific Reports, details the creation of three distinct controllers: stability, optimal, and robust-optimal.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of these controllers using a rotary inverted pendulum, a challenging system with an inverted pendulum on a rotating base.

Drones have emerged as valuable tools for various applications, from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions. However, their dependence on battery life has been a significant limiting factor, with commercial models offering a maximum flight time of 45 minutes. Researchers from the University of Southern Denmark have been working tirelessly to address this challenge by developing drones that can recharge directly from power lines, thereby extending their time in the air.

These innovative drones employ a gripper system attached to a customized Tarot 650 Sport drone, complete with a quadcopter propulsion system, autopilot module, and other essential components. The drone's integrated camera and millimeter-wave radar system work in tandem to identify the closest power line when the battery begins to run low.

The drone maneuvers itself beneath the power line and extends a pair of inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into the gripper. An inductive charger then draws power from the line, charging the drone's battery. Once fully charged, the gripper releases the cable, and the drone resumes its flight.

Initially, the researchers envisioned drones used for power line inspections to be the primary beneficiaries of this charging system. In 2022, they unveiled a self-charging drone that could top up its battery from power lines. Recently, the team enhanced the gripper system and demonstrated a practical application for the technology.

In a paper to be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the researchers stated that their system ""is, to the best of our knowledge, the first-in-the-world system with the ability to sustain operation throughout many inspection/charging cycles powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment."" In a remarkable demonstration, the drone remained airborne for over two hours, completing five cycles of power line inspection and charging.

The ability to charge directly from power lines offers a promising solution to the battery limitations faced by drones. By enabling drones to operate for extended periods, these self-charging drones will significantly enhance their utility in various industries, including infrastructure inspection, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
