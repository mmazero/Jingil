https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/ember-ceo-interview/,Ember's journey from hot coffee to medication transport,Coffee Mug Startup Overcomes Challenges [41 CHARS],"

Ember's first Indiegogo campaign in 2015 garnered sideways glances, with many questioning the need for a $129 heated coffee mug. However, the startup's success story is clear, with 3 million units sold and the company's mission expanding to include medical products such as the Ember Cube and baby bottles.

Recently, TechCrunch interviewed Ember founder and chairman Clay Alexander to discuss the company's progress and plans. Alexander revealed that the company has sold nearly a million units annually and has made a name for itself in the heated/cooling industry.

""We're well over 3 million units [of the smart mug] at this point,"" Alexander told TechCrunch. ""We're nearing a million units a year now. When I first created this technology, I had so many people in my life say, ‘oh Clay, you’ll never sell a $100 electronic coffee mug. You’ve lost your mind.’ As a founder, you just have to have perseverance, and you have to have this gut instinct that overpowers logic.""

In addition to its well-known smart mug, Ember has also ventured into the medical sector, creating the Ember Cube, a shipping box for temperature-controlled products, and baby bottles.

Ember's inception was driven by a relatable frustration - keeping a cup of coffee warm. Alexander, a coffee aficionado, worked with a team of engineers, designers, and marketers to create a product that would maintain the perfect temperature of coffee from the first sip to the last. The mug's heating technology was achieved using a simple smartphone app, and it was available on Indiegogo for $360,000. The company later raised a series of equity rounds, including a $13 million Series C and a $23 million Series E.

Ember's success in the hardware space was not without challenges. The company faced high product development and manufacturing costs, complex IP protection issues, and international expansion. Despite these obstacles, Alexander remained determined and worked with his team to create a sleek, minimalist design that seamlessly integrated the heating technology into the mug's walls.

The mug also featured wireless charging, customizable temperature settings, and a smartphone app that allowed users to control it remotely. However, the company faced further challenges in bringing the product to market, including the high upfront investment in materials, tooling, and manufacturing processes.

To safeguard its innovations, Ember navigated the complex world of intellectual property protection, securing patents and trademarks. This was a daunting prospect for a startup with limited resources, requiring careful strategizing and prioritization.

One of the biggest challenges Ember faced was securing a deal with one of the world's most influential retailers. The company was already selling its products in high-profile retail stores, but Apple, in particular, was interested in selling Ember's product. However, Apple does not like to do localized launches, requiring Ember to wait until the product passed all of Apple's tests before launching it in the US.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/terraform-industries-converted-electricity-and-air-into-synthetic-natural-gas/,Terraform Industries converts electricity and air into synthetic natural gas for the first time," ""Terraform Industries Converts Electricity and Air into Synthetic Natural Gas"" ","The world is highly dependent on the extraction, processing, transportation, and consumption of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas. However, these resources come with a significant cost: they are finite, challenging to extract, and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Instead of reducing humanity's dependence on hydrocarbons, Terraform Industries has developed a solution to produce this resource using electricity and air, through a system called the Terraformer.

The Terraformer is roughly the size of two shipping containers and consists of three subsystems: an electrolyzer that converts solar power into hydrogen, a direct air capture system that captures CO2, and a chemical reactor that ingests both these inputs to produce pipeline-grade synthetic natural gas. The entire machine is optimized for a one-megawatt solar array.

Although the process is not entirely new, Terraform has innovated on it by building its proprietary direct air capture system and adapting it to work with a variable energy source, solar power. The company has achieved significant cost reductions, converting clean electricity into hydrogen at less than $2.50 per kilogram of H2 and filtering CO2 for less than $250 per ton, which is a world record.

Terraform's synthetic natural gas now hits cost parity with conventionally sourced liquified natural gas, and the company plans to bring the prices down even further to ensure the scalability of the solution. The success of the Terraformer will depend on a strong business case, as CEO Casey Handmer acknowledges.

The company has agreements to sell small amounts of natural gas produced to two unnamed utilities, and ongoing discussions regarding prototyping or selling standalone electrolyzers as separate products. Additionally, Terraform is taking reservations for the first production Terraformers with the ultimate goal of ramping up factories to support a buildout that could transform the world's energy systems.

In conclusion, Terraform Industries' solution to produce hydrocarbons using electricity and air through the Terraformer is a promising step towards reducing the environmental impact of energy production. The company's innovations in the direct air capture system and adaptation to work with solar power have resulted in significant cost reductions, and the potential for scalability in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reactor-and-Gas-Injection-System.jpg?resize=1200,772",2024-04-01 17:05:04,"Looking for a solution that can reduce the cost and environmental impact of hydrocarbon production?

In recent months, cloud vendors such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have relaxed their egress fees. These fees are a tax of sorts that cloud companies charge customers to move their data to another vendor, and they are seen as a way of keeping existing customers in the fold. However, this approach has not been well-received and has not fostered goodwill. As a result, these companies are beginning to see the error in their ways by easing these fees, albeit with some caveats and friction involved.

The move towards a multi-cloud world, a stricter regulatory environment, and consumer backlash are some of the factors that have led to this shift in market dynamics. It's clear that we are moving into a multi-cloud world where it's more important than ever to remove friction around moving data.
