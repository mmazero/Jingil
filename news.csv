Mahbod Moghadam, an entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of Genius and Everipedia, passed away last month due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. He was 41. Moghadam was celebrated for his unique personality, creativity, and commitment to helping creators get paid directly for their work.

The tech startup world has recently mourned the loss of Moghadam, with many paying tribute to him on social media platforms. Josh Constine, a former TechCrunch writer and investor, described Moghadam as ""a complex, edgy, and at times problematic guy, but also genuinely funny, brilliant, and always unique."" Moghadam had been residing in Los Angeles, focusing on finding new ways to compensate creators for their contributions.

One of his recent projects was HellaDoge, a social media platform that rewarded users with dogecoin for creating dogecoin-related content. The idea was to enable users to benefit directly from their participation, unlike traditional platforms such as Facebook and Twitter that generate ad revenue. Similar to HellaDoge, Moghadam had proposed Communistagram, where creators could connect their Venmo accounts and get paid directly for using the platform.

Moghadam's interest in creators' compensation dates back to 2009 when, after graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, he became a lawyer during the economic downturn. When he was eventually let go from his law firm, he used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman. The platform allowed users to annotate and explain hip-hop lyrics, eventually attracting rappers who used it to explain their own lyrics and correct users' mistakes.

Rap Genius gained popularity and rebranded as Genius, expanding its remit. However, Moghadam's behavior began causing issues, leading to his resignation from Genius in 2014. He went on to co-found Everipedia, which later became IQ.wiki. Moghadam then joined Mucker Capital as an entrepreneur in residence.

Throughout his career, Mog",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8698091273_475f659390_b.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-07 01:51:05,"Co-founder of Genius & Everipedia, Mahbod Moghadam, Passes Away at 41: Celebrating His Impact on Creator Compensation

The race to the moon is heating up once again, as NASA has selected three companies to develop lunar terrain vehicles (LTV) for its Artemis missions. These vehicles will play a crucial role in supporting NASA's efforts to explore the lunar surface, with the chosen LTV set to become a familiar sight at the moon's south pole starting from 2030. In this blog post, we will delve into the details of this exciting development, exploring the companies involved, the vehicles they are creating, and the role that these LTVs will play in NASA's lunar exploration plans.

[COMPANIES SELECTED FOR FEASIBILITY STUDY]

NASA has chosen Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Venturi Astrolab to develop their respective LTVs in a year-long feasibility study. At the end of this period, only one company will be selected for a demonstration mission, during which their vehicle will be completed and sent to the moon for rigorous testing. The successful LTV will then become a key component of the Artemis V crewed mission, slated for launch in early 2030.

[LTV REQUIREMENTS AND CONTRACT DETAILS]

The LTV that ultimately makes it to the moon's surface must serve a dual purpose, functioning as both a crewed and uncrewed vehicle. At times, it will transport astronauts across the lunar terrain, while at other times, it will operate remotely, conducting exploratory missions. NASA plans to contract the chosen LTV for lunar services through 2039, with all task orders related to the LTV amounting to a potential value of up to $4.6 billion. The selected company will also have the opportunity to utilize its LTV for commercial activities during downtime.

[COMPANY PROFILES AND LTV DETAILS]

Intuitive Machines, which is developing the Moon Racer LTV, has already secured multiple contracts with NASA as part of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.

In a recent announcement, social network X revealed that it is granting access to xAI's Grok chatbot to its Premium tier subscribers. This update follows Elon Musk's announcement last month, extending the availability of the chatbot to more paid users. As of now, only Premium and Premium+ users can engage with Grok in select regions.

Last year, Musk's xAI unveiled Grok and made it accessible to Premium+ users, who pay a monthly subscription fee of $16 or an annual fee of $168. With the latest development, users subscribing to the $8-per-month plan can now interact with the chatbot. Users can choose to communicate with Grok in either ""Regular mode"" or ""Fun mode,"" with warnings indicating that the chatbot may return inaccurate responses.

Grok's capabilities go beyond summarizing trending news stories, as seen in a Twitter post by DogeDesigner. The chatbot not only condenses stories but also generates headlines. However, there have been instances where Grok produced misleading headlines, such as the fake claim about Iran striking Tel Aviv with heavy missiles.

Elon Musk's objective in expanding Grok's user base might be to rival other products, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude. Over the past few months, Musk has been vocal about his criticisms of OpenAI's operations, even going as far as filing a lawsuit against the company in March over its alleged deviation from its non-profit goal. OpenAI, in turn, sought to dismiss all of Musk's claims and disclosed email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

In an effort to be more transparent, xAI open-sourced Grok last month but without providing any details about the training data. While this move raises questions about the latest version of the model and the company's commitment to transparency regarding its development approach and training data information, it showcases the growing interest in large language models and their potential applications.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-06 05:55:24,"""Experience xAI's Grok Chatbot: Interact with our AI on Social Network X's Premium plan!

Introduction

The traditional 9-to-5 office setup is becoming a relic of the past as more employees crave flexibility and work-life balance. The shift towards remote work, hastened by the pandemic, has led to a significant change in workers' attitudes and preferences. This article delves into the benefits and challenges of remote work, examines the arguments put forth by CEOs advocating for a return to the office, and explores the potential outcomes of this ongoing debate.

The Shift Towards Remote Work

In the late 1980s, working from home was an anomaly. Today, 14% of U.S. workers perform their duties remotely full-time, and this number is projected to reach 20% by 2023. A staggering 58% of white-collar employees desire flexibility in their work schedules, enabling them to work from home a few days a week. However, despite the pandemic-induced shift towards remote work, some CEOs are pushing for a return to the office, causing mixed messages in the post-pandemic world.

The Argument Against Remote Work

High-profile CEOs like IBM's Andy Jassy and Tesla's Elon Musk have been vocal in their disapproval of remote work. Jassy has reportedly informed employees that staying remote might not bode well for them, while Musk has labeled remote work as ""morally wrong."" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, an advocate for a digital HQ during the pandemic, has also expressed concerns about productivity losses among new employees working from home.

The Potential Drawbacks of a Return to the Office

A study by the University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business found that return-to-office mandates could negatively impact employee satisfaction without improving firm performance. Moreover, employees who value flexibility in their work environment have been found to be more engaged and productive. Companies forcing employees to return to the office may face higher burnout rates due to the lack of control over their work schedules.

The Advantages of Remote Work

Remote work offers several benefits, including increased access to a diverse talent pool and enhanced employee satisfaction. Companies embracing remote work have reported finding better candidates by expanding their search beyond a single geographical location. The freedom to work from home can also lead to improved work-life balance and reduced stress levels, ultimately leading to increased job satisfaction and loyalty.

Conclusion

The future of work is still uncertain, with CEOs advocating for a return to the office while employees continue to value flexibility. It is crucial for companies to strike a balance between remote work and in-office collaboration, considering the advantages and challenges of both. By embracing the flexibility of remote work while maintaining a strong in-office presence, companies can foster a thriving work environment that supports employee satisfaction, productivity, and success.","Title: The Future of Work: Thriving in a Flexible Work Environment
