Elon Musk's social networking platform, formerly known as Twitter, recently announced that it would remove the option for paid users to hide their blue checkmarks. Once a prestigious symbol granted by Twitter to distinguished profiles, the blue checkmark has transformed into a purchasable item under Musk's leadership—a shift that has muddled its significance. As X continues grappling with trust and safety issues, we delve into the latest development surrounding the blue checkmarks and explore their evolving meaning.

A Brief History of the Blue Checkmark

Initially introduced by Twitter, the blue checkmark served as a status symbol, signifying that a user's account belonged to a person or entity of public interest. Conferred upon individuals boasting significant influence or societal impact, the coveted badge aimed to differentiate legitimate accounts from potential impersonations. However, everything changed once Elon Musk acquired the platform and converted the checks into a premium, pay-to-play feature.

From Prestige to Purchase: An Embarrassing Shift?

By turning the checks into a paid commodity, Musk diminished the value of the blue checkmark as a status or validation symbol. Despite initial reluctance among some users to publicly acknowledge their financial support for the embattled platform, several perks accompanied the premium tier. Among these advantages were editing capabilities, extended post lengths, enhanced direct messaging options, and yes, the choice to conceal the newly purchased checkmarks. Alas, this privilege now faces elimination.

Users React: Losing the Ability to Hide Payments

With the impending removal of the ""hide checkmark"" functionality, disgruntled users have begun expressing their disappointment online. Many lamented having to display the evidence of their patronage on a struggling platform. Although X struggles with larger concerns, including impersonation, misinformation, and abuse, the decision to eliminate the hiding option adds yet another layer of complexity to the ever-changing landscape of the blue checkmarks.

Confusion Reigns Supreme: What Does a Blue Check Really Mean?

Under Musk's tenure, the definition of the elusive blue checkmark has grown increasingly ambiguous. After initially restricting the badges to paying customers, X eventually restored them for certain high-profile accounts while introducing additional layers of uncertainty. Most notably, the platform bestowed blue checkmarks upon influential users possessing more than 2,500 ""verified"" followers. This expansion resulted in two tiers of premium membership: one for standard paying users, and another for those with sizable followings.

Navigating the Verification Minefield

In essence, ""verified"" morphed into a catchall term encompassing both paying and non-paying users without explicit designation. With each modification, understanding the implications behind a blue checkmark grew more challenging. Furthermore, X failed to clarify these distinctions, exacerbating the bewilderment surrounding the purpose and legitimacy of the accreditation process.

In Summary: A Rocky Road Ahead for Blue Checkmarks

From revered hallmark to monetized emblem and back again, the blue checkmark has endured a tumultuous journey on X. While attempting to address pressing trust and safety concerns, the platform instead fostered further confusion through haphazard changes to the verification system. Only time will tell whether X can restore clarity and credibility to the much-debated blue checkmarks. Until then, stay tuned for future updates on this ongoing saga.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-blue-gold.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-12 04:25:40,"""Uncover the truth about X's changing blue checkmarks!

This event dramatically altered the duties of various entities, including the Ukrainian military, civilians facing invasions and artillery fire, and the Cyberpolice of Ukraine, which shifted its focus to confront new challenges and threats in cyberspace.

Yevhenii Panchenko, Chief of Division at the Cyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine, discussed these changes during a presentation at the Chainalysis LINKS conference in New York City. With approximately one thousand employees, roughly forty of whom specialize in tackling crypto-related offenses, the Cyberpolice's mission is to counteract ""all manifestations of cybercrime in cyberspace."" Following the invasion, however, their role expanded further: ""we were also responsible for the active struggle against the aggression in cyberspace.""

In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Panchenko elaborated on the evolving responsibilities of the Cyberpolice amidst wartime Ukraine. These include gathering evidence of potential war crimes committed by Russian soldiers (often shared on social media), detecting and preventing cryptocurrency funds supporting the conflict, debunking misinformation campaigns, handling ransomware assaults, and educating citizens on proper cybersecurity habits. Below is an abridged and clarified version of this dialogue.

Interview Transcript:

TechCrunch: In what ways has your position and that of the police evolved since the invasion?

Yevhenii Panchenko: Our roles have nearly completely transformed. While we maintain traditional tasks such as managing all facets of cyberinvestigation, the conflict necessitated several adjustments. Relocating certain departments became crucial due to operational requirements, while additional responsibilities emerged. Among those, collecting proof regarding Russian troops—an entirely novel endeavor for us prior to February 2022—is paramount. We aim to compile incriminating material featuring soldiers involved in occupying regions and perpetrating violence against innocent individuals.

Additionally, we investigate instances involving Russian hackers attacking Ukraine's infrastructure through distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) strikes, defacing websites, and disseminating false information. Due to the absence of collaboration with Russian authorities, locating and sharing vital details poses unique difficulties. Consequently, establishing connections with domestic intelligence agencies remains essential.

Units dedicated to safeguarding critical national infrastructure face another challenge. Apart from conventional weaponry, adversaries employ cyberattacks aimed at sabotaging utilities and communication networks. As a result, protecting these assets assumes equal importance alongside ground defense operations.

Shifting gears towards digital offenses, does Russia engage in illicit activities beyond physical warfare tactics?

Indeed, Russian operatives often utilize social media platforms to share images or videos celebrating acts of destruction, illustrating their presence in captured territories. Such posts may serve as valuable evidence for ongoing investigations pertaining to alleged war crimes.

Are you actively searching for signs of wrongdoing among Russian soldiers operating digitally?

Absolutely. Gathering visual documentation posted across various platforms serves as pivotal evidence for probes conducted by our department against Russian parties implicated in the crisis.

Considering recent surges in ransomware incidents, how has the situation unfolded inside Ukraine since the invasion began?

Initially driven by financial gains, current ransomware attacks primarily seek to demonstrate effectiveness and strength. Instead of demanding payment, assailants intentionally cripple systems and spread chaos. Thus, instead of pursuing monetary compensation, contemporary attacks increasingly revolve around causing disruptions.

Have distinctions become blurred between criminal elements backed by Russia and official state-sponsored cyberoperations?

Discerning between independent malicious actors and those sanctioned by the Russian government presents a considerable obstacle. Often, these agents attempt to obfuscate ties linking them to state institutions. Distinguishing genuine affiliation becomes exceedingly challenging given the intermingled nature of both factions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/yevhenii-panchenko-cyberpolice-ukraine.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-12 14:52:47,"Meta Description:

In the past, Twitter was the unchallenged champion of social media engagement. I reveled in the daily interactions with a diverse group of individuals, discussing everything from current events to light-hearted subjects. It was an excellent platform to connect with my readers, allowing me to establish meaningful relationships with many of you.

Regrettably, the engagement on Twitter has significantly dwindled following its transformation into something new. Despite upgrading to the premium plan, the results remained disappointing. Currently, I am experiencing the best engagement on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

LinkedIn, distinct from other social media platforms, focuses on professional backgrounds and serves as an online resume. While it allows for posting and connecting with others, the level of discourse is generally more professional due to its career-oriented nature. The free version of LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft, provides extensive functionality. However, LinkedIn Premium offers additional benefits, particularly for business outreach and job hunting.

As a LinkedIn Premium Business user, I appreciate the ability to add a link button to my profile and posts. While the tier offers several gig, job, and lead-hunting features, I was intrigued by the AI helper and decided to test it. The AI's attempt at enhancing my profile summary, however, fell short of my expectations. Consequently, I chose not to utilize the AI for the remainder of my profile.

Despite the AI's shortcomings, I liked the idea of adding a simple ""Visit My Website"" or ""View My Blog"" button to my profile. Although I don't consider the premium features worth $45 or more each month, the button feature is an attractive addition if you require other Premium features.

To add the button, navigate to your profile and click ""Add custom button."" You will then be presented with five possible button names. Once the button is added, it will appear on both your profile and posts.

LinkedIn Learning, a feature accessible with all Premium plans, might justify the cost.

Introduction

In recent news, Apple has taken a significant step towards embracing the ""right to repair"" movement by announcing support for using used components—such as cameras, displays, and batteries—in iPhone 15 repairs. This change indicates a shift in attitude regarding customer rights and empowerment, raising essential questions about ownership, repair choices, and accessibility to various parts. Let us explore this topic further and understand its implications.

A Growing Movement: The Right to Repair

The concept of the 'right to repair' revolves around consumers being granted the freedom to choose how they repair products they own, whether independently or through authorized channels. In today's world of intricate modern electronics, manufacturers tend to design devices that favor proprietary components and repair services, making self-repairs challenging and expensive. Consequently, customers may end up purchasing new devices instead of repairing older ones due to these barriers. However, movements like the 'Right to Repair' aim to break down these obstacles and give power back to consumers.

Apple's Evolving Attitude Towards Repair Options

Previously, Apple had faced criticism concerning paired parts, where only approved components could function correctly with particular devices. Recently, though, Apple has advocated for legislation in multiple states promoting consumer repair alternatives while backing away from insisting upon exclusive component usage. With the latest announcement permitting used parts installation during iPhone 15 repairs, Apple demonstrates commitment towards increased user autonomy and flexibility.

Benefits of Encouraging Independent Repairs

Allowing independent repairs benefits both consumers and the environment. By granting users access to replacement parts, they save money and reduce e-waste generated by discarded gadgets. Moreover, fostering competition among repair providers drives innovation and efficiency, ultimately enhancing service quality and affordability. Furthermore, encouraging DIY (Do It Yourself) repairs helps develop skills and empowers individuals to learn more about maintaining their devices.

Conclusion

Although there remains room for improvement, Apple's current position marks progress in acknowledging consumer demands for greater control over product maintenance. As technology advances, so too must our understanding of ownership rights and responsibilities. Companies like Apple leading the charge pave the way for wider acceptance of the 'right to repair,' ensuring long-term sustainability and equitable practices across industries.

Introduction

As the world embraces renewable energy sources and electrifies energy end-uses, societies are increasingly influenced by weather conditions. Simultaneously, the rapidly changing climate is leading to extreme weather events becoming the 'new normal.' To comprehend how climate change will impact wind and solar generation, electricity demand, and other weather-dependent energy variables, energy system planners and operators require detailed, high-resolution data projected into the future.

Addressing the Gap in High-Resolution Data

Acknowledging the need for better climate data, Grant Buster, a data scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), along with his colleagues Brandon Benton, Andrew Glaws, and Ryan King, developed Sup3rCC (Super-Resolution for Renewable Energy Resource Data with Climate Change Impacts). This cutting-edge, open-source model employs generative machine learning to generate downscaled future climate data sets, which are accessible to the public at no cost.

Sup3rCC produces physically realistic, high-resolution data 40 times faster than traditional dynamical downscaling methods, addressing the challenges presented by existing downscaling techniques. This tool has the potential to revolutionize the way future energy systems are studied and planned, providing essential climate data for integration into energy system models and offering valuable insights for decision-makers.

Overcoming the Energy-Climate Disconnect

Traditionally, energy system research and climate research have been siloed due to the coarse resolution of global climate models in both time and space. This gap has led to most energy system planners relying on historical high-resolution wind, solar, and temperature data for modeling electricity generation and demand. However, ignoring future climate conditions can result in unreliable energy systems, as evidenced by recent weather-related blackouts in California and Texas.

To bridge the energy-climate disconnect, a growing community of modelers and analysts at NREL are collaborating to bring together the energy and climate modeling communities. This effort aims to effectively and appropriately utilize climate information to guide energy system design and operation.

Fortera Unveils Carbon Capture Tech for Greener Cements in California","Title: A Revolutionary Solution for Greener Cement Production: Fortera's Carbon Capture Technology

Introduction

The construction sector significantly contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. This issue arises primarily from the production of cement – the essential ingredient in creating concrete. However, hope is on the horizon as innovative startups like Fortera introduce groundbreaking technologies aimed at reducing carbon emissions during cement fabrication. By capturing emitted CO2 and reintegrating it into the manufacturing process, this California-based firm plans to open its first commercial-scale operation, marking a significant milestone in sustainable industrial practices.

Captivating Innovation: How Fortera Transforms Emissions into Creation

Fortera has engineered a unique system capable of intercepting CO2 exhaust from cement kilns and repurposing it to generate supplementary cement units (SCUs). Their methodology involves routing captured CO2 back into the initial reaction, thereby producing SCUs without requiring any additional calcium carbonate. Once integrated into regular cement products, these SCUs result in reduced overall carbon emissions.

In collaboration with CalPortland, one of the largest cement facilities in the Western United States, Fortera commences its inaugural commercial-grade project in Redding, California. Initially, they aim to manufacture sufficient quantities to blend with around twenty percent of CalPortland's annual output, ultimately decreasing associated carbon footprints by ten percent. Encouragingly, both companies anticipate increasing demands for elevated blends offering up to fifty percent reductions, along with purer products containing seventy percent less carbon.

Background and Development

Fortera's story began with Calera, another pioneering enterprise established in 2007 that focused on converting CO2 into cement. Despite successfully pouring over a hundred tons of low-carbon cement into various structures such as offices and walkways, Calera faced financial difficulties leading to its closure in 2014. Nevertheless, founder Ryan Gilliam seized upon valuable lessons learned at Calera when establishing Fortera in 2019 alongside several ex-employees. With extensive experience under their belts, the team recognized the untapped potential in collaborating directly with existing cement plants rather than proposing widespread changes to current industries.

Scalability and Economic Viability

According to Gilliam, cement plants exist virtually everywhere, spaced approximately 250 miles apart worldwide, typically situated adjacent to abundant limestone quarries. Leveraging this pre-existing infrastructure allows Fortera's technology to serve as an economically feasible alternative compared to constructing entirely novel facilities. Furthermore, since the technique relies on identical raw materials utilized across the cement industry, Fortera ensures minimal disruption and maximum compatibility throughout implementation.

Comparatively, certain low-carbon cement and concrete initiatives necessitate alterations within the present manufacturing landscape. Consequently, implementing those alternatives might prove time-consuming and costlier than adopting Fortera's seamless integration approach.

Industry Collaboration and Government Regulations

Beyond Fortera's promising innovations, multiple organizations actively pursue similar goals in mitigating the environmental impacts of cement and concrete production. These entities include architectural education programs, local governmental regulations promoting lower-carbon concrete usage, and international associations driving ambitious sustainability targets. Examples encompass the American Institute of Architects, cities like Vancouver, British Columbia, and even California's stringent emission reduction laws. Moreover, influential coalitions such as the First Movers Coalition harness vast corporate purchasing powers to stimulate market demand for low-carbon cement.

Conclusion

As demonstrated above, substantial progress occurs in addressing climate change concerns related to concrete and cement production. Thanks to visionaries like Fortera and supportive alliances, we edge closer toward realizing greener industrial practices globally. As these developments unfold, let us remain optimistic regarding future advancements and increasingly sustainable methods employed across diverse sectors.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/making-cement-is-very.jpg,2024-04-12 04:25:43,"""Revolutionize cement production with Fortera's carbon capture technology.

Cybersecurity startup Noname Security nears a $500M acquisition by Akamai Technologies, as market realities and Fed's rate hikes impact VC-backed company valuations.","Title: Noname Security and Akamai Technologies: A Tale of Acquisition Amidst a Shifting Landscape

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, a fascinating development has emerged. Noname Security, a startup specializing in API protection, is reportedly in advanced talks to sell itself to Akamai Technologies for $500 million. Although the deal is not final and could still change or even fall through, it's a story worth delving into, shedding light on the players involved, the forces at play, and the potential implications.

Noname Security, co-founded in 2020 by Oz Golan and Shay Levi, has Israeli roots but is headquartered in Palo Alto. The startup has been successful in raising $220 million from venture investors and was last valued at a staggering $1 billion in December 2021. This valuation came after a Series C round led by Georgian and Lightspeed, which raised $135 million. However, the proposed sale price represents a significant discount from this valuation, a reflection of the current market realities.

Despite the lower sale price, early-stage investors in Noname Security are set to receive a meaningful return from the sale. Meanwhile, later-stage investors, particularly those who invested in the last round, should recoup their capital, even if the hoped-for profits of the 2021 valuation may not materialize. The deal values Noname Security at approximately 15 times its annual recurring revenue. If the sale goes through, the startup's roughly 200 employees are expected to transition to Akamai.

Akamai Technologies, a leading content delivery network and cloud services provider, has declined to comment on the potential acquisition. Noname Security, too, has refrained from commenting, following its policy of not engaging with rumors or speculation.

The road to this potential acquisition has been influenced by several factors. The U.S. Fed's decision to raise interest rates has caused the valuations of many VC-backed companies to plummet. Many of these companies, which raised capital at the height of the tech boom, are now seeking buyers and new funding rounds simultaneously. This dual-track process is a common strategy in the finance world when IPO markets are frozen.
