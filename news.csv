[Most interesting startup stories from the week)

Truth Social's Financial Reality Show
Trump's Truth Social, under the umbrella of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has been making headlines with its questionable financial performance. With a $58 million loss on a mere $4 million in revenue, TMTG's story is a far cry from the typical Silicon Valley ""burn cash now, profit later"" model. The company's lifelines are fraying, as it faces a lack of user growth, no VC sugar daddies, and the unenviable position of being publicly accountable while struggling to attract advertisers.

Rubrik's IPO: A Tale of Bleeding Money
Cybersecurity darling Rubrik recently filed for an IPO, revealing a history of bleeding money and modest revenue growth. Despite raising vast amounts of venture capital, the company has yet to turn a profit. However, with a pivot to subscription models, Rubrik hopes to change its fortunes and appeal to public market investors.

Accel's Existential Crisis in India
Venture capital firm Accel, known for its successful investments in Indian unicorns, is facing an existential crisis. As it realizes that founders view all VC money as the same, Accel is rethinking its strategy for its Atoms accelerator program.

Crypto Venture Investments on the Rise
The crypto venture landscape is heating up, with Q1 2024 witnessing an increase in investments. According to Tom Schmidt, a partner at Dragonfly Capital, the market is starting to resemble a pot of water nearing a boil.

Introduction

In a significant shift from its previous stance, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced plans to label AI-generated content instead of automatically removing it from its platforms. This decision comes after feedback from Meta's Oversight Board, public opinion surveys, and consultations with academics and other experts.

The New Labeling Policy

Starting in May 2024, Meta will begin labeling AI-generated content with its ""Made with AI"" labels. These labels will be applied to videos, images, and audio clips based on industry-shared signals. The company already uses an ""Imagined with AI"" tag for photorealistic images created using its own AI tools. Moreover, the labels will become more prominent if the AI-generated content is deemed to have a ""particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance.""

The Reason Behind the Change

Meta's existing AI moderation approach, which was established in 2020, has been deemed too narrow by the company's Oversight Board. Initially written when AI-generated content was relatively rare, the policy only covered videos that were created or modified by AI to make it seem like a person said something that they didn't. However, recent advances in generative AI have necessitated a broader policy that includes any type of manipulation showing someone doing something they didn't do.

The board also argues that removing AI-manipulated media that doesn't otherwise violate Meta's Community Standards could restrict freedom of expression. Therefore, the board recommended a less restrictive approach where Meta would label the media as AI-generated but still allow users to view it.

Addressing Fake News

Meta and other companies have faced criticism that the industry hasn't done enough to curb the spread of fake news. The use of manipulated media is particularly concerning, especially with the 2024 elections in the US and many other countries, where videos and images of candidates can be easily faked.

Meta has pledged to continue collaborating with industry peers and remain in dialogue with governments and civil society to help people identify AI-generated content. The company will also review its approach as technology progresses.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/disneyland-roaming-star-wars-droids/,Disneyland's interactive Star Wars droids are here and you can see them until June 2, Disney's Interactive BD-X Droids Return: AI-Powered Star Wars Fun at Disneyland ,"Title: Experiencing the Magic of Droid Communication: Disney's BD-X Droids and AI-Powered Home Robots

Introduction

In a world where conversing with a droid seems limited to science fiction films, Disney is transforming the fantasy into reality at Disneyland. By combining cutting-edge robotics with a touch of enchantment, Disney has introduced free-roaming BD-X droids that interact with park guests. These charming robots, designed to mimic the movements of a small child, have captured visitors' hearts with their adorable mannerisms and expressive motions.

Disney's Droid Revolution

During the Fall of 2022, Disneyland debuted the BD-X droids in the Star Wars Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland Park. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and the droids quickly became a beloved attraction. Recently, Disney announced that the BD-X droids would return for the Season of the Force, a Star Wars-themed seasonal celebration taking place from April 5 to June 2.

Creating the Magic: Robotics and Animation

To bring these delightful droids to life, animators design the motions, which the robots then learn through reinforcement learning. This method involves rewarding the two-legged robots when they successfully replicate the animator-designated motions. Moritz Bacher, associate lab director at Disney Research, describes these robots as ""duckling robots"" because of their ability to emote and move like a young child.

Interestingly, OpenAI's notorious chatbot, ChatGPT, was trained using a similar method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This technique refines the model based on human feedback, allowing it to better understand and respond to user inputs.

The Balancing Act: Developing Natural Movements

An essential aspect of the BD-X droids' appeal is their seemingly effortless and bouncy walking movements, which require a remarkable amount of balance to achieve. As park-goers eagerly anticipate the return of these droid friends, they continue to share their in-park interactions on social media, such as the video below of the droids engaging in a playful dance routine.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/amazon-bazaar-india-low-cost-fashion-and-lifestyle-store/,Amazon takes on India rivals with low-cost fashion store, Amazon Enters India's Affordable Fast-Fashion Market with Bazaar Store ,"Title: Amazon's Quiet Entry into India's Affordable Fast-Fashion Market with Bazaar

Introduction

Amazon has covertly entered India's thriving fashion and lifestyle market with a new ""special store"" called Bazaar. This move places Amazon in direct competition with Walmart-owned Flipkart and Reliance's Ajio, both of which have made significant strides in India's rapidly expanding fast-fashion market.

The Debut of Amazon Bazaar

Amazon launched Bazaar on its India Android app, quietly recruiting sellers in February. The e-commerce giant promised sellers hassle-free delivery, zero referral fees, and access to a vast customer base. The store offers a wide variety of products, including clothing, accessories, jewelry, handbags, shoes, traditional and western wear, and home goods like kitchenware, towels, bed linens, and decor items.

The Rise of Affordable Fast-Fashion in India

According to a note from brokerage firm Bernstein, India's e-commerce market is experiencing a shift in category mix. While mobile and consumer electronics shares are declining, fashion has seen the strongest growth since FY19 and now holds the highest category share. Affordable fast-fashion is driving purchases on many Indian shopping apps, making it a critical category for Amazon to conquer.

Bazaar's Offerings and Competition

Bazaar features trendy t-shirts starting at 129 Indian rupees ($1.55) and sneakers priced under $3. Amazon's e-commerce arm operates in India as the second-largest player, behind Flipkart, despite AWS's market-leading position in the country. To maintain and expand its market share, Amazon must successfully penetrate the fast-fashion category.

In recent years, India's fast-fashion e-commerce market has witnessed remarkable growth, with local startups taking inspiration from global leaders like Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo. Flipkart, which owns the fashion e-commerce platform Myntra, currently leads the category. However, Reliance's Ajio has captured approximately 30% market share in under a year, according to Bernstein.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/fda-approves-first-prescription-only-app-for-depression/,FDA approves first prescription-only app for depression, FDA Approves First Prescription Digital Therapeutic for Depression: Rejoyn ,"Title: Prescription Digital Therapeutics: A New Frontier in Depression Treatment

In the rapidly evolving world of technology and healthcare, a new type of treatment is making waves. Prescription digital therapeutics, or software-based medical treatments, have been gaining recognition for their potential to address gaps in mental health care. On Monday, the FDA approved Rejoyn, a groundbreaking smartphone app designed to alleviate symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). Developed by Click Therapeutics and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Rejoyn is the first digital therapeutic for depression approved by the FDA, paving the way for a new era in mental health treatment.

Mental health apps are increasingly popular, offering a more accessible and convenient alternative to traditional therapy. However, these apps are minimally regulated and cannot replace professional care, especially for those with mental health disorders. Prescription digital therapeutics like Rejoyn aim to bridge this gap, providing evidence-based interventions that can be used alongside supervised care.

Rejoyn is designed for adults aged 22 and older who have been diagnosed with MDD and are taking antidepressant medication. Unlike other therapy apps, Rejoyn requires a prescription from a healthcare provider. The app uses a six-week program called Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT), a series of brain-training exercises developed by neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. EFMT taps into the brain's neuroplasticity and targets neural areas affected by depression. By strengthening and balancing connections in the brain, regions responsible for processing and regulating emotions can work together more effectively.

The FDA's approval of Rejoyn is timely, given the rising rates of depression in the United States. A May 2023 Gallup survey found that 29% of US adults have been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lives, an increase of almost 10% since 2015. Nearly 18% of respondents 18 and over reported being depressed or receiving treatment for depression. Digital therapies like Rejoyn could help broaden treatment options, but their long-term effectiveness and insurance coverage remain uncertain.

Otsuka and Click expect Rejoyn to be available on iOS and Android operating systems in late 2024.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a significant part of our daily lives, powering everything from voice assistants to recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms. While the AI boom has led to rapid technological advancements, there is a noticeable disparity in the representation of women in this field. To address this issue, TechCrunch's Dominic-Madori Davis and Kyle Wiggers embarked on a mission to highlight the contributions of women in AI through a series of interviews.

A Ray of Hope Amongst the AI Hype

The rapid growth of the AI industry has resulted in substantial investments, regulatory scrutiny, and intense corporate competition. However, amidst this hype, there is an enormous opportunity for startups to introduce innovative AI solutions to various industries that could benefit from modernization. While the media often focuses on the achievements of men in AI, women have been making significant strides in this field as well.

Addressing the Imbalance

To bring attention to the achievements of women in AI, TechCrunch's Davis and Wiggers interviewed several notable figures, including:

1. Irene Solaiman, Head of Global Policy at Hugging Face: Solaiman shared her experiences navigating the intersection of AI and policy, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in AI development.

2. Sarah Kreps, Professor of Government at Cornell University: Kreps, an expert in international relations, discussed the impact of AI on national security and the need for more diverse perspectives in this critical area.

3. Heidy Khlaaf, Safety Engineering Director at Trail of Bits: A seasoned cybersecurity professional, Khlaaf shed light on the challenges and rewards of working in AI safety and security.

The Equity Podcast: A Platform for Diversity in AI

The Equity crew frequently conducts interviews in addition to their regular programming, which includes a weekly kick-off show on Mondays, a midweek startup news rundown, and a roundtable discussion of the week's biggest news on Fridays. In this particular episode, Davis and Wiggers joined the Equity podcast to discuss their series on women in AI, providing insights into the experiences and perspectives of these trailblazing women.

Instagram Threads, Meta's answer to Twitter, has yet to catch up with its competitor regarding real-time conversations and trending topics. On Friday, when users turned to Twitter to discuss the New York/New Jersey area earthquake, Threads missed the opportunity to shine. Earthquake and related terms took hours to appear in Threads' trends section, while the same hashtags dominated Twitter's Trends section and discussions.

Users on Threads, however, were actively discussing the earthquake, using tags like ""EarthquakeThreads"" or ""NYC Threads"" to surface their posts. But without the use of hashtags, trending topics in Threads might be less obvious. The multiplicity of tagging conventions, such as ""earthquake,"" ""Earthquake Threads,"" or ""NYC Threads,"" can fragment conversations and prevent any of them from gaining sufficient velocity to become top trends on Threads.

Instagram explained that Threads' five top trends are based on various signals, such as the number of people talking about a topic and the number of people engaging with related posts. Since the earthquake was a regional event, it may have taken more time for enough people to join the conversation, which is based on national conversations.

However, this delay in capturing real-time trends could hinder Threads' ability to compete with Twitter fully. Meta's plan to distance itself from political discussions might further impact Threads' growth, as Twitter is widely perceived as the hub for breaking news, active topical discussions, and a meeting place for journalists.

Twitter, formerly known as Twttr, has demonstrated the power of real-time information since its early days. In 2006, when the San Francisco earthquake struck, the founders and users alike experienced the earthquake through Twttr and realized its potential to create a shared experience.

Despite Threads having 130 million monthly active users, it faces challenges in delivering a true Twitter-like experience. As Max Read described it in a March newsletter, ""Threads is the gas-leak social network,"" referring to the randomness of the posts that filled users' For You feeds.

In a recent announcement, Social Network X has revealed that it's expanding access to xAI's Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers. This decision comes after Elon Musk's announcement last month, allowing more paid users to interact with the AI-powered chatbot in select regions.

Previously, Grok was exclusively available to Premium+ users, who paid a monthly fee of $16 or an annual subscription fee of $168. With the latest update, Social Network X is making the chatbot accessible to users paying $8 per month, opening the opportunity for more individuals to experience this innovative technology.

Grok offers two modes for users to interact with: Regular mode and Fun mode. As with any Large Language Model (LLM) product, Grok includes labels that indicate potential inaccuracies in the chatbot's answers. Though there have been instances where Grok generated inaccurate summaries or headlines, the technology continues to evolve and improve.

One notable example occurred earlier this week when Social Network X introduced a new explore view inside Grok, which summarizes trending news stories. In a surprising turn, Grok generated a fictional headline stating, ""Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles."" This incident highlights the importance of monitoring and refining AI-generated content to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Musk's decision to expand Grok's availability might be driven by his desire to compete with other AI chatbot products, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude. Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations in recent months, even going as far as suing the company in March over what he perceives as a betrayal of its non-profit goal. In response, OpenAI filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk's claims and released email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

Additionally, xAI open-sourced Grok last month, but without sharing any details about the training data.

In our increasingly digital world, many of us rely on platforms like Google Books and Google Scholar to discover books on various topics or delve into academic research. However, recent developments have revealed that these sites are now indexing low-quality, AI-generated books, which are being attributed to human authors. This troubling trend first came to light through the work of 404 Media, which discovered AI-generated content while investigating the use of ChatGPT.

When querying ChatGPT about current events, it often responds with the phrase, ""As of my last knowledge update."" Exploiting this characteristic, 404 Media searched Google Books for the same phrase and uncovered numerous books that appeared to have included ChatGPT-generated content verbatim. These titles, often published in 2023 and spanning various subjects, were attributed to human authors, raising serious concerns about the authenticity and quality of the content.

Upon closer examination, it became evident that these books were superficial, offering little more than rehashed information akin to a Wikipedia entry. Furthermore, these AI-generated books were discovered to be available for purchase on popular retail platforms such as Amazon.

The issue extends beyond Google Books, as Google Scholar, a repository for human research, was also found to contain AI-generated content. A search for the same phrase in Google Scholar returned 19 pages of results, including papers on topics such as at-risk youth, diabetes, autism, COVID-19, and airline pilot fatigue.

The widespread presence of AI-generated content on reputable platforms is concerning, as it undermines the credibility of these resources and potentially misleads readers. Google, in response to 404 Media's findings, stated that it would ""continue to evaluate our approach as the world of book publishing evolves."" However, the company did not mention removing these AI-generated books from their services.

In summary, the rise of AI-generated content in digital libraries highlights the importance of vigilance when evaluating online resources. As AI technology becomes more sophisticated, it is crucial to maintain a critical eye and ensure the credibility of the information we consume.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b093ab7779d555827f18ed230b1346fb4d31bf24/2024/04/05/2331d04b-5a07-4605-95ad-f71bf16ea752/bookwallgettyimages-184268876.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-05 00:00:00,"Discover AI-generated nonsense in reputable digital libraries!

Snapchat adjusted its ""solar system"" feature, which ranked paid subscribers' proximity to friends, after receiving bad press. The feature, displaying users' positions in networks based on interaction frequencies, can now be turned off by default for Snapchat+ subscribers, addressing mixed feelings and concerns.","Title: Snapchat Adjusts ""Solar System"" Feature to Address User Concerns

A few days ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that Snapchat's ""solar system"" feature, which ranks paid subscribers' proximity to their friends, was causing anxiety among teenagers. In response, Snapchat has made adjustments to the feature, demonstrating its commitment to user feedback and experience.

The solar system feature displayed users' positions in their friends' networks based on their online interaction frequencies. For instance, being in the ""Mercury"" position meant frequent communication, while ""Uranus"" signified less closeness. Although online engagement may not directly correlate with real-life relationships, such a feature could lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.

Snapchat acknowledged the mixed feelings associated with the Solar System feature. Users might appreciate knowing they're close to someone, but they could also feel disheartened if they're not as close as they'd like to be. As a result, Snapchat decided to turn off the Solar System feature by default for Snapchat+ subscribers, who can still enable it if they wish.

By default, turning off the feature may create some friction, but if it's already popular among teenagers, they will likely seek out the setting to reactivate it. Snapchat claims that less than 0.25% of the community uses the Solar System option, but since it's only accessible to paid subscribers, the percentage is not surprising. A more relevant statistic would be the number of Snapchat+ users who have engaged with the feature.

The solar system feature wasn't Snapchat's only friend-ranking system. It also offers a private feature called ""Best Friends,"" which highlights the most frequently contacted individuals at the top of the contact list with a heart or smiley emoji. Another popular feature called ""Streaks"" encourages repeated app usage by representing consecutive days of interaction between users.

Snapchat has faced criticism for its addictive features and potential psychological harm, particularly regarding the Streaks feature. In response, the company introduced a way to pause Streaks and restore lost ones. However, the Solar System feature has been another source of concern for users and their families.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-ai-optimize-your-phone-bill/,Can AI Optimize Your Phone Bill?, AI Optimizes Mobile Plans: Walmart's Mobile X Offers Personalized Budget-Friendly Plans with AI Data Analysis ,"Title: The Future of Mobile Plans: Personalization Through Artificial Intelligence

In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI) is set to permeate various aspects of our lives, from the technology we use daily to the way we manage our finances. This revolutionary technology will not only enhance the functionality of our devices but also change how we pay for them. Enter Mobile X, an innovative mobile plan provider exclusively available at Walmart, which leverages AI to offer customized and budget-friendly plans.

The Power of AI in Data Processing

One remarkable advantage of AI lies in its ability to swiftly and accurately process vast quantities of data, surpassing traditional data analysis methods that rely on human analysts. These manual techniques can be time-consuming and error-prone, whereas AI can identify complex patterns and correlations that may escape human notice.

Mobile X's AI system meticulously analyzes user data to optimize mobile plans according to individual needs. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all plans based on rough estimates, Mobile X's Personalized Access plans provide continuous optimization tailored to users' ever-changing requirements.

How Mobile X Uses AI to Customize Plans

When users sign up for a Personalized Access plan with Mobile X, they begin with a free 10-day trial period during which the AI examines their data usage habits. The analysis then projects monthly data, text, and talk time requirements. Subsequently, the AI recommends a customized plan via the Mobile X app, allowing users to further adjust it to fit their budget. Users also have the option to manually select an initial plan if they prefer.

Through AI-powered analysis, Mobile X can detect patterns in user behavior and suggest optimized plans accordingly. For instance, it may identify that a user consistently uses less data than they pay for or rarely makes phone calls. The following month, the AI may then propose an updated plan with fewer minutes and a lower data threshold, enabling users to save money.

The Future of AI in Mobile Innovation

Mobile X's application of AI for customized mobile plans is just the beginning of how this technology could reshape the mobile industry. As AI advances, we can anticipate increasingly innovative applications to emerge. For example, virtual assistants capable of handling complex customer service queries and predictive maintenance systems that prevent network outages could significantly enhance user experiences.

Introduction

Autism affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, according to the CDC. Early diagnosis can significantly improve a child's developmental outcome. EarliTec Diagnostics, an Atlanta-based startup, is at the forefront of this effort, having recently raised $21.5 million in a Series B round to expand its innovative diagnostic system for children as young as 16 months old. This groundbreaking approach has the potential to change the lives of many families dealing with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Understanding EarliTec Diagnostics' System

EarliTec Diagnostics' FDA-authorized system uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze a child's eye movements while they watch short videos and social interactions on a screen for 12 minutes. The device tracks the child's eye movements and, according to EarliTec, children with autism will not focus on the video in the same way that neurotypical children do. This method offers a more accessible, quicker, and potentially more accurate diagnostic tool compared to traditional assessment methods, which can take up to four hours and have long waitlists.

The Power of Early Detection

EarliTec's rapid diagnostic test is a game-changer for autism care, as early intervention is crucial for optimal developmental outcomes. The sooner a child is diagnosed, the sooner they can begin receiving tailored therapies and interventions, enabling them to reach their full potential. Moreover, a quicker diagnosis reduces stress and anxiety for both the child and their family, allowing them to better understand the child's needs and access available resources.

Backing from Visionary Investors

The recent $21.5 million Series B funding round was co-led by Nexus NeuroTech Ventures and Venture Investors, both of which specialize in supporting companies that create solutions for brain disorders and healthcare, respectively. The funding will be used to further expand EarliTec's commercialization efforts, improve its assessment and treatment options, and potentially expand the age range of diagnosable children.

The new $20B Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund aims to steer over $160B in capital into climate tech, focusing on underserved communities and projects like residential heat pumps. This green bank has a solid track record and is projected to attract $7-12 in private investment per dollar spent, bolstering climate tech demand and innovation.","Title: The New Green Bank: A Game-Changer for Climate Tech Investment

A groundbreaking development in the U.S. promises to steer over $160 billion in capital into climate technology, filling a crucial gap in the market. This new 'green bank' is designed to underwrite smaller-scale projects, such as installing heat pumps in homes or retrofitting affordable housing, which have historically been overlooked due to lower profitability.

The green bank, officially called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, received a $20 billion boost from the Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced grants to eight organizations, which will then issue loans for climate-focused projects. A significant portion of these funds, over $14 billion, will be directed towards tribal, rural, low-income, and disadvantaged communities—groups that have been underserved in the transition to cleaner technologies.

Green banks have a solid track record, as demonstrated by the Connecticut Green Bank's delinquency rate, which mirrors that of other commercial lenders in both residential and commercial portfolios. Additionally, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund aims to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar it disperses, potentially even more—up to $12 or higher, according to McKinsey's estimations.

The U.S. is projected to require $27 trillion by 2050 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Although the green bank's $20 billion allocation may seem modest compared to this figure, its potential to stimulate private investment and act as a recurring fund (rather than a one-time grant) will likely amplify its impact.

Entrepreneurs and investors stand to benefit from this initiative, as the funding will not only support consumers and small businesses but also entertain equity investments. The influx of resources should bolster demand for market-ready climate technologies, while simultaneously encouraging founders and investors to develop solutions tailored for low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Introduction

Andres Freund, a Microsoft principal software engineer, discovered a hidden backdoor in the SSH remote security code of the Debian Linux beta. This code was part of the xz data compression library, maintained by Jia Tan. The backdoor was designed to enable attackers to take over Linux systems. This incident highlights the growing problem of malicious code in open-source repositories and the importance of open-source security.

The Rise of Malicious Code in Open-Source Repositories

In recent years, there has been a surge in malicious code in open-source repositories. Popular JavaScript package managers like Node Package Manager (npm) and Python software repository Python Package Index (PyPI) have been used to host crypto mining and hacking malware. Additionally, open-source malware programs like SapphireStealer aim to steal user IDs, passwords, and other sensitive information. While Linux and its utilities have had their share of bad code, no one had successfully hidden malware within Linux—until now.

The XZ Data Compression Library Backdoor

The backdoor discovered in the xz data compression library did not make it into any production Linux distributions. However, users of Fedora, Debian, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and other bleeding-edge beta distributions were potentially at risk. This incident serves as a reminder that even though Linux dodged a bullet, the consequences could have been severe had the malware reached widely used Linux systems.

The Role of Open Source in Thwarting the Attack

Open source played a crucial role in uncovering the attack. As Mark Atwood, Amazon's open source program office principal engineer, pointed out, the attack failed because it was open source. If the same attack had targeted a closed-source component, it might have gone unnoticed. The fact that the attack happened in open-source software enabled the security community to identify and mitigate the threat.

The Identity and Motives Behind the Attack

The identity of the person behind the name Jia Tan and the motive for the attack remain unknown. There is speculation that it could be an elaborate attempt to plant crypto miners in high-powered Linux systems. However, without concrete evidence, these remain educated guesses.
