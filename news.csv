In the realm of artificial intelligence, a new contender has emerged, poised to challenge the dominance of OpenAI and Anthropic. Mistral AI, a Paris-based startup, unveils its latest offering: Mistral Large, a groundbreaking language model that promises to rival the likes of GPT-4 and Claude 2 in terms of reasoning capabilities.

Alongside Mistral Large, the company introduces Le Chat, its very own alternative to ChatGPT, currently in beta. This chatbot is designed to engage users in natural language conversations, offering assistance and information.

Mistral AI's journey began in May 2023, securing an impressive $112 million seed round within weeks of its incorporation. The company's momentum continued with a subsequent $415 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in December.

Initially positioning itself as an open-source AI company, Mistral AI's approach has evolved. While its first model was released under an open-source license, larger models like Mistral Large are offered through a paid API with usage-based pricing.

This business model mirrors that of OpenAI, with Mistral Large's pricing currently set at $8 per million input tokens and $24 per million output tokens. Notably, Mistral Large is significantly more cost-effective than GPT-4, offering a 5 to 7.5 times lower cost for a similar context window.

The question on everyone's mind: how does Mistral Large compare to its formidable competitors? Mistral AI claims a second-place ranking behind GPT-4 based on benchmark evaluations. However, real-life usage may reveal disparities, warranting further testing.

In addition to Mistral Large, the company introduces Le Chat, an accessible chat assistant available at chat.mistral.ai. This beta release offers three model options: Mistral Small, Mistral Large, and Mistral Next, a prototype designed for concise responses. It's important to note that Le Chat currently lacks web access.

Mistral AI has ambitious plans for Le Chat, including a paid version tailored for enterprise clients. This version will provide central billing and moderation mechanisms, catering to the specific needs of businesses.

The company's partnership with Microsoft is another significant development. Mistral models will be made available to Azure customers, expanding their reach and accessibility. This collaboration opens doors for potential future collaborations and opportunities.

Mistral AI's entry into the AI arena is a game-changer, challenging the existing landscape and offering compelling alternatives. As the AI revolution continues to unfold, Mistral AI is a name to watch, poised to make waves in the industry.

In the heart of Paris, Europe's grand Web3 event, NFT Paris, unfolded as a vibrant forum for innovative ideas and groundbreaking projects. Amidst the bustling Grand Palais Éphémère and various city-wide side events, the Future Fashion Summit stood out as a platform for fashion's digital transformation.

During the summit, Wrangler, the iconic American denim brand, unveiled a captivating collaboration with MNTGE, a digital wearables brand rooted in vintage clothing. This limited-edition Wrangler X MNTGE Archive Capsule, exclusively gifted to attendees, showcased premium vintage western shirts and denim jackets. These garments were adorned with co-branded NFC (near field communication) chipped patches, allowing for digital signatures and recording the garment's history on the blockchain.

The carefully curated pieces hailed from the archives of MNTGE co-founder Sean Weatherspoon and Wrangler's own treasure trove. Spanning the '70s through the '90s, these vintage gems featured patches inspired by archival design elements, including Wrangler's iconic logos and past collaborations like ""Mr. Wrangler"" and the Peter Max collection from the 1960s.

Beyond the capsule collection, an immersive installation featured a tailor in residence, offering guests the chance to personalize their Wrangler pieces with collaborative NFC-chipped patches. This interactive experience further emphasized the fusion of fashion and technology.

Nick Adler, co-founder of MNTGE, expressed his admiration for Wrangler's enduring legacy and the shared vision that sparked this collaboration. He envisioned the partnership growing into something even more substantial in the future.

The Future Fashion Summit served as a catalyst for dialogue and future partnerships, bringing together leaders from international luxury fashion houses and digital brands. Representatives from renowned brands like LVMH, Richemont, Puig, Kering Group, Burberry, Hermes, McLaren, DressX, and Tik Tok graced the event.

Panel discussions delved into pressing issues such as circularity and the gaming industry's potential for brands and retailers. The consensus emerged that Digital Product Passports, recording proof of ownership and authenticity, are crucial drivers for the resale economy.

Panelists emphasized the need for compelling reasons for consumers to adopt this technology. While some advocated for rewards systems, others favored a multifaceted approach, generating value through ubiquity. The quest for a ""killer app"" to minimize associated frictions was also a topic of discussion.

Gaming's role as a customer acquisition channel was eloquently presented by Tommy Hilfiger's gaming and Web3 manager, Morgan Evans. He cited Roblox's introduction of in-game e-commerce as a testament to gaming's potential. Kai Henry of Future Studios reinforced this notion, highlighting the influence of avatars on Gen-Z's real-life presentation.

Adler acknowledged the impact of Gen-Z's street style and social media influencers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Evans candidly discussed Hilfiger's use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating user-generated content (UGC) for gaming, emphasizing the challenge of maintaining brand fidelity while pushing boundaries.

The Future Fashion Summit was made possible through the generous support of sponsors BNB Chain, EON, Fewture Studios, Ledger, Wrangler, MNTGE, PURPLE, Arianee, and Evian. The event was hosted in partnership with 10 Magazine.
