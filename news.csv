https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-concrete-possibilities-materials.html,New concrete possibilities from waste materials,"The use of recycled concrete and glass aggregates in concrete production has emerged as a promising way to increase waste material recycling rates. However, durability issues have been a challenge for some combinations of recycled ingredients.

Researchers from Flinders University and other international institutions have developed a sustainable concrete formula that can resist alkali–silica reaction (ASR), which can negatively impact the mechanical properties and durability of concrete due to the significant silica content in some recycled aggregates.

The study focused on using a blend of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and fly ash as binder materials to mitigate the negative effects of ASR on concrete made with crushed glass sand and coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA).

Results showed that while both GGBS and fly ash were effective in reducing ASR expansion, fly ash was more effective than GGBS. Combining 20% GGBS with 30% fly ash in recycled aggregate concrete containing glass sand resulted in similar strengths and water absorption compared to concrete with natural sand.

However, increasing GGBS content led to decreased strengths and increased water absorption in the concrete. The study highlighted the potential of combining fly ash and GGBS at an optimal ratio to mitigate ASR effects in recycled aggregate concrete containing crushed glass sand.

Dr. Aliakbar Gholampour, an expert in sustainable construction materials at Flinders University, emphasized the importance of integrating recycled materials into construction practices to create a more sustainable built environment and circular economy. This approach can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve natural resources by minimizing the use of natural sand and coarse aggregate.

The research also found that replacing natural sand with glass sand led to significant ASR expansion of mortar bars, but incorporating fly ash reduced this expansion rate. Additionally, replacing natural sand with glass sand decreased compressive and flexural strengths of concrete, but adding fly ash increased the strengths of ASR-affected RCA concrete with glass sand.

Incorporating GGBS improved chloride attack resistance in ASR-affected RCA concrete with glass sand, but increasing GGBS content led to higher chloride ion penetration. The study underscores the importance of finding the right balance of materials to enhance the durability and performance of recycled aggregate concrete.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-concrete-possibili-1.jpg,2024-03-26 10:05:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.engadget.com/ron-desantis-signs-bill-requiring-parental-consent-for-kids-to-join-social-media-platforms-in-florida-192116891.html,Ron DeSantis signs bill requiring parental consent for kids to join social media platforms in Florida,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently approved a new law, HB 3, that imposes stricter regulations on children under 16 regarding their use of social media. The law prohibits children under 14 from participating in social media platforms altogether. For 14- and 15-year-olds, parental or guardian consent is now required to create a new account or use an existing one on any social media platform. The law also mandates that companies operating these platforms must comply with requests to delete accounts within five business days. Failure to do so could result in hefty fines of up to $10,000 per violation, escalating to $50,000 per instance if the violation is deemed intentional or reckless.

The scope of the law extends beyond age restrictions. It also includes a provision for age verification on websites or apps that contain content deemed harmful to users under 18. This verification process is triggered when the platform contains a significant amount of such material, requiring users to confirm their age through a proprietary system or a third-party service. Notably, news agencies are exempt from this requirement irrespective of their content.

Privacy concerns have been raised regarding the age verification process, especially when accessing sensitive content online. To address this, websites can opt for an ""anonymous age verification"" system that does not retain any personal information. Failure to comply with this safeguard could result in significant civil penalties of $50,000 per violation.

It is worth noting that Governor DeSantis vetoed a similar bill earlier this month, which did not include provisions for parental consent for teenagers under 16. NetChoice, a trade association representing social media platforms, has criticized the new law as unconstitutional, warning of potential privacy risks associated with extensive data collection for age verification.

Despite potential legal challenges, the new law is set to take effect on January 1. House Speaker Paul Renner emphasized the need for intervention to protect children from the addictive nature of social media platforms, stating that young individuals may not have the cognitive ability to recognize the harm caused by excessive technology use. While the law is expected to face legal scrutiny, Governor DeSantis acknowledged the likelihood of First Amendment challenges in court.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z2Rg6F0w8HnQafmU3UIBjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjM-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/ed2c5d80-ead7-11ee-9ded-335471c23e51,2024-03-25 19:21:16,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/amazon-dark-pattern-design-fine/,Amazon fined in Poland for dark pattern design tricks,"Amazon has been fined in Poland for misleading consumers about the conclusion of sales contracts on its online marketplace. The country's consumer and competition watchdog, the UOKiK, imposed a hefty fine of close to $8M for deceptive design elements that create a false sense of urgency during the purchasing process. This misleading behavior includes misrepresenting product availability, delivery dates, and the timing of sales contract conclusions.

The UOKiK began investigating Amazon's sales practices in September 2021 following complaints from consumers who did not receive their purchases. The probe concluded with a formal investigation in February 2023, leading to the recent sanction against Amazon.

One of the key findings of the investigation was that Amazon does not consider the moment of purchase as the conclusion of a sales contract, leading to potential cancellations of orders even after payment. The UOKiK highlighted that Amazon fails to clearly communicate this crucial detail to shoppers, often burying it in hard-to-access information displayed in a less visible manner.

The watchdog also criticized Amazon for using dark pattern design techniques, such as gray text on a white background, to hide important information while employing suggestive messaging like ""Buy now"" or ""Proceed to finalize the purchase"" to mislead consumers about the contract conclusion.

Furthermore, Amazon's misleading practices extend to false information about product availability and delivery deadlines, creating a sense of urgency through countdown clocks and stock availability indicators. However, the investigation revealed that Amazon does not always meet these deadlines or ship products immediately as claimed, leaving consumers in the dark about the actual delivery timelines.

In response to the sanction, the president of UOKiK, Tomasz Chróstny, emphasized the importance of accurate information for consumers, stating that deceptive practices like those employed by Amazon create unnecessary pressure on shoppers to make rushed purchase decisions.

While Amazon does offer a delivery guarantee, the investigation found that the company failed to adequately inform consumers about their rights to refunds in case of delays. The lack of transparency in providing information about the ""Delivery Guarantee"" at the time of purchase further adds to the misleading practices identified by the UOKiK.

Amazon has the option to appeal the sanction, and the company's press office in Poland has confirmed that it will do so. The appeal process will determine the final outcome of this case, as Amazon faces scrutiny for its deceptive sales practices in Poland.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gettyimages-537264132.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-27 11:34:45,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/unicorn-founders/,"New study of unicorn founders finds most are 'underdogs,' and female founders are rising","New Study Reveals Traits of Unicorn Founders

A recent study delving into the backgrounds of unicorn founders, those leading companies valued at over a billion dollars, has uncovered some intriguing insights. Conducted by Defiance Capital, the ""Unicorn Founder DNA Report"" focused on 845 unicorns and 2,018 founders from the U.S. and U.K. between 2013 and 2023. The aim was to identify the common characteristics of these successful entrepreneurs.

Key Findings:

- 70% of unicorn founders are considered ""underdogs,"" including immigrants, women, and people of color.
- There has been a notable increase in female founders, with 17% of unicorns having a female founder in 2023.
- 53% of unicorn founders hold degrees from the top 10 global universities.
- 49% of unicorn CEOs have STEM degrees, with 64% of female founding CEOs also coming from STEM backgrounds.
- Only a small percentage of VC funds, such as SV Angel and YC, are heavily involved in unicorn investments at the seed stage, indicating a fragmented market.

Diversity in Unicorn Founders:

While white founders still dominate the unicorn landscape, there is a growing presence of Asian and non-white founders. Approximately 38% of unicorns have at least one founder who is not white, with 62% having immigrant founders. However, only 3% of unicorns have a black founder.

Immigrant and female founders face challenges in securing funding from top VC firms, with only 21% receiving support. Teams with female founders tend to be younger when founding their unicorns, indicating a shift in entrepreneurship dynamics.

Traits of Successful Unicorn Founders:

The study identified three key traits common among unicorn founders:
1. No ""plan B""
2. A chip on the shoulder
3. Unlimited self-belief

Many unicorn founders developed a growth mindset early in life, driven by personal experiences of adversity and limitations in their native environments. They often exhibit ambition, resilience, and a passion for meaningful causes.

Implications for the Future:

The study highlights the need for a more inclusive and diverse approach to unicorn investments. While established VC funds tend to favor male, immigrant founders with STEM backgrounds, there is a growing opportunity in supporting female founders and underrepresented groups.

In conclusion, the study sheds light on the complex and varied backgrounds of unicorn founders, emphasizing the importance of resilience, ambition, and a sense of purpose in achieving entrepreneurial success. As the landscape continues to evolve, embracing diversity and unique perspectives will be key to fostering innovation and growth in the startup ecosystem.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-22.26.09.png?resize=1200,804",2024-03-27 10:24:50,Innovation,Innovation

The project, which may utilize hydrogen fuel to reduce emissions, is estimated to cost around five trillion yen ($33 billion), as reported by Japanese media sources.
An official announcement is anticipated after a closed-door gathering of politicians, experts, and business leaders to discuss a new strategy for the aviation industry. Kazuchika Iwata, the state minister for economy, trade, and industry, emphasized the need for the Japanese aircraft industry to evolve beyond being just a parts supplier. He highlighted the importance of venturing into carbon-neutral technologies, particularly hydrogen, to secure a leading role in the global market by partnering with key players to develop a narrow-body aircraft.
Reports suggest that the target timeline for the completion of this new passenger jet is set for 2035. This renewed effort to create Japan's first domestically produced airliner in over fifty years follows the discontinuation of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' previous project in February 2023. The initial endeavor to develop a twin-engine plane for short-to-medium haul flights faced significant challenges, leading to its eventual abandonment after a decade of technical issues and delivery setbacks.
In contrast, China recently unveiled its first homegrown passenger jet in Singapore, aiming to rival industry giants like Airbus and Boeing with its single-aisle model. Japan's last commercial airliner, the YS-11 turboprop, was introduced in 1962 but was eventually phased out approximately ten years later.
The potential use of hydrogen fuel in the new passenger jet is particularly noteworthy due to its minimal carbon dioxide emissions, aligning with Japan's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

However, complications arose as Wasoko revealed that it only received $113 million from this round. VNV Global had contributed $20 million to this funding round.

VNV Global's valuation model for Wasoko is based on trading multiples of public peers rather than historical funding rounds. Despite the valuation adjustment, Wasoko expressed appreciation for VNV Global's continued support and investment in the company, emphasizing their long-term value growth potential.

As a prominent B2B grocery marketplace in Africa, Wasoko has established partnerships with major suppliers like P&G and Unilever, enabling direct access to quality goods at competitive prices. Founded by Daniel Yu in 2014, Wasoko has expanded its operations across multiple African markets and reported significant growth, with a customer base exceeding 200,000 small retailers utilizing the platform for on-demand orders.

https://www.engadget.com/this-camera-captures-1563-trillion-frames-per-second-184651322.html,This camera captures 156.3 trillion frames per second,"Scientists have developed an innovative scientific camera called SCARF (swept-coded aperture real-time femtophotography) that has the ability to capture images at an incredible encoding rate of 156.3 terahertz (THz) per individual pixel, equivalent to a staggering 156.3 trillion frames per second. This groundbreaking camera opens up new possibilities in fields that study micro-events that occur too rapidly for current high-end scientific sensors to detect.

SCARF has successfully recorded ultrafast events such as absorption in a semiconductor and demagnetization of a metal alloy, showcasing its potential for advancing research in various areas including shock wave mechanics and medical advancements. Professor Jinyang Liang from Canada's Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) led the research team, building upon his previous work in ultrafast photography. The findings were recently published in Nature and highlighted in a press release by INRS, with coverage by Science Daily.

Traditionally, ultrafast cameras operate using a sequential method that captures frames individually and stitches them together to observe moving objects. However, this approach has limitations when studying phenomena like femtosecond laser ablation and optical chaos. SCARF revolutionizes this process by utilizing an imaging modality that enables rapid sweeping of a static coded aperture without distorting the ultrafast phenomenon. This allows for encoding rates of up to 156.3 THz per pixel in a single shot, offering tunable frame rates and spatial scales in both reflection and transmission modes.

In simple terms, the camera employs computational imaging to capture spatial information by introducing light to its sensor at different intervals. By delaying the processing of spatial data, the camera can capture chirped laser pulses at an astounding rate of 156.3 trillion times per second. A computer algorithm decodes the time-staggered inputs, transforming the vast number of frames into a cohesive image.

Remarkably, SCARF achieves these feats using readily available optical components, making it a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and high-quality solution compared to existing technologies. While the camera is primarily designed for research purposes, collaborations with companies like Axis Photonique and Few-Cycle hint at potential commercial applications for academic and scientific institutions.

For a more detailed understanding of the camera and its potential implications, the full research paper can be accessed in Nature. This cutting-edge technology paves the way for new discoveries and advancements in ultrafast imaging, offering a glimpse into the future of high-speed scientific research.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SMiKpX01vf6kS9FeFTp8og--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Mjg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/08034950-eb9d-11ee-baef-05cbfe0fb11d,2024-03-26 18:46:51,Innovation,Innovation
