Moreover, the companies operating these platforms must comply with requests to delete such accounts within five business days. Failure to do so could result in significant fines, up to $10,000 per violation. In cases of deliberate or reckless violations, the penalties escalate to $50,000 per incident.

Under this new law, individuals under 14 are barred from creating or accessing social media accounts in Florida. The platforms are required to erase existing accounts along with any associated personal data. While the legislation doesn't specify particular social media platforms, it applies to services featuring elements like infinite scrolling, reaction metrics, live streaming, and auto-play videos. However, email platforms are excluded from these regulations.

This legislation not only impacts the online behavior of children but also implements an age verification requirement for websites or apps containing potentially harmful content for users under 18. For instance, Floridians visiting adult sites must verify their age using a platform on the site or a third-party system. News outlets are exempt from this provision, even if they meet the content threshold.

Privacy concerns arise with the requirement to disclose personal information for age verification. Websites have the option to direct users to an ""anonymous age verification"" system, where third parties are prohibited from retaining identifying data. Failure to comply with this rule could result in a $50,000 civil penalty per violation.

Earlier this month, DeSantis vetoed a similar bill that would have prohibited teens under 16 from using social media apps without parental consent. NetChoice, a trade association representing social media platforms, has criticized the law as unconstitutional, arguing that it will lead to extensive data collection and compromise privacy and security.

State House Speaker Paul Renner highlighted the need for intervention to protect children from the addictive nature of technology. The law becomes effective on January 1, but it may face legal challenges. Renner anticipates social media companies to file lawsuits immediately, and DeSantis acknowledges potential First Amendment challenges to the law.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z2Rg6F0w8HnQafmU3UIBjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjM-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/ed2c5d80-ead7-11ee-9ded-335471c23e51,2024-03-25 19:21:16,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/databricks-spent-10m-on-a-generative-ai-model-that-still-cant-beat-gpt-4/,"Databricks spent $10M on new DBRX generative AI model, but it can't beat GPT-4","If you had $10 million to raise the profile of your major tech company, how would you spend it? Would you go for a Super Bowl ad or an F1 sponsorship? While those are traditional marketing strategies, a more unconventional approach could involve investing in training a generative AI model.

Generative AI models are becoming attention-grabbers in the tech world, serving as funnels to vendors' core products and services. Take, for example, Databricks' latest offering, DBRX. This generative AI model, similar to OpenAI's GPT series and Google's Gemini, is now available on GitHub and the AI dev platform Hugging Face for both research and commercial use. With base (DBRX Base) and fine-tuned (DBRX Instruct) versions, DBRX can process a wide range of topics and languages, including English, French, Spanish, and German.

While Databricks touts DBRX as ""open source,"" similar to models like Meta's Llama 2 and Mistral's offerings, there is ongoing debate about whether these models truly fit the open-source definition. Databricks invested approximately $10 million and two months into training DBRX, claiming that it outperforms existing open-source models on standard benchmarks.

However, accessing and using DBRX can be challenging, especially for non-Databricks customers. Running the model requires high-end hardware, such as servers or PCs with Nvidia H100 GPUs, which can be costly and out of reach for many developers and solopreneurs. While running the model on third-party clouds is an option, the hardware requirements remain steep.

To address these challenges, Databricks offers the Mosaic AI Foundation Model as a managed solution. This product not only runs DBRX but also provides a training stack for fine-tuning the model on custom data. Customers can host DBRX privately using Databricks' Model Serving offering or work with the company to deploy it on their preferred hardware.

DBRX distinguishes itself with its MoE (mixture of experts) architecture, featuring 16 experts compared to the typical eight. This architecture, shared with models like Mistral's and Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, contributes to DBRX's claimed 2x faster performance compared to Llama 2. While DBRX excels in certain benchmarks, it falls short of OpenAI's GPT-4 in broader applications.

Despite its strengths, DBRX, like other generative AI models, has limitations. It can produce inaccurate responses due to ""hallucinating"" answers and lacks multimodal capabilities, focusing solely on text processing. The sources of data used to train DBRX remain undisclosed, raising questions about its training data's quality and diversity.

In conclusion, while DBRX represents a significant advancement in generative AI, its accessibility and performance may pose challenges for some users. As the tech industry continues to evolve, the role of generative AI models like DBRX in shaping future innovations remains a topic of ongoing discussion and exploration.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1177951659.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-27 12:00:33,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.engadget.com/this-camera-captures-1563-trillion-frames-per-second-184651322.html,This camera captures 156.3 trillion frames per second,"Scientists have developed an ultrafast scientific camera called SCARF (swept-coded aperture real-time femtophotography) that can capture images at an encoding rate of 156.3 terahertz (THz) per individual pixel, equivalent to a staggering 156.3 trillion frames per second. This cutting-edge camera has the potential to revolutionize the study of micro-events that occur too rapidly for current high-end scientific sensors to capture.

SCARF has already demonstrated its capabilities by successfully recording ultrafast phenomena such as absorption in semiconductors and the demagnetization of metal alloys. This breakthrough research opens up new possibilities in various fields, including shock wave mechanics and the development of more efficient medical treatments.

The driving force behind this innovative camera is Professor Jinyang Liang from Canada's Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), a renowned expert in the field of ultrafast photography. Building on his previous groundbreaking work, Professor Liang and his team published their latest research in Nature, as reported by Science Daily and summarized in a press release from INRS.

Unlike traditional ultrafast cameras that capture frames sequentially and then piece them together, SCARF takes a fresh approach. By utilizing a unique imaging modality that enables ultrafast sweeping of a static coded aperture without distorting the phenomenon, this camera achieves encoding rates of up to 156.3 THz per pixel in a single shot. This revolutionary technique allows for the observation of rapid events in both reflection and transmission modes with tunable frame rates and spatial scales.

In simple terms, SCARF employs computational imaging to capture spatial information by allowing light to enter its sensor at different times. By processing the raw data using a computer algorithm, the camera can decode the time-staggered inputs and reconstruct trillions of frames into a coherent image. What sets SCARF apart is its use of off-the-shelf optical components, making it a cost-effective, low-power solution with high measurement quality compared to existing methods.

While SCARF is primarily geared towards research applications, collaborations with companies like Axis Photonique and Few-Cycle indicate potential commercial development for wider use in academic and scientific settings. For a more detailed understanding of the camera and its implications, the full paper in Nature provides further technical insights.

In conclusion, SCARF represents a significant advancement in ultrafast imaging technology, offering unprecedented capabilities for studying rapid events with remarkable precision and efficiency. This groundbreaking camera has the potential to drive innovation across various scientific disciplines and pave the way for exciting discoveries in the future.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SMiKpX01vf6kS9FeFTp8og--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Mjg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/08034950-eb9d-11ee-baef-05cbfe0fb11d,2024-03-26 18:46:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-new-ai-tool-from-adobe-makes-generating-the-images-you-need-even-simpler/,This new AI tool from Adobe makes generating the images you need even simpler,"The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we create images from simple text inputs. Tech giants like Adobe are constantly enhancing user experiences, with the latest update to Adobe Firefly showcasing the new Structure Reference feature.

During the recent Adobe Summit, Structure Reference was introduced as a powerful tool within Adobe Firefly, allowing users to input an image as a template for the AI model to generate a new image with similar layout and composition. This feature gives users unprecedented control over the output of generated images, enabling them to fine-tune the ""strength"" of the structure reference to tailor the image creation process to their specific needs.

In a live demo at the event, a user uploaded a profile image as a structure reference, prompting Firefly to produce multiple new images that retained the structure of the original photo. By adjusting the strength of the reference, users can dictate how closely the generated image adheres to the original template, offering a spectrum of creative possibilities.

Moreover, Structure Reference works seamlessly alongside Style Reference, which uses an image as a reference to generate a new image in the same style, including color schemes and overall aesthetic. By leveraging both features and detailed prompts, users can ensure that the images generated meet their requirements on the first attempt, eliminating the need for multiple iterations and refining.

Deepa Subramaniam, Adobe's VP of product marketing, highlighted the transformative nature of these features, likening it to a shift from 2D to 3D in the creative process. The ability to use images as guidelines opens up new avenues for creativity, allowing users to visually communicate their ideas without the constraints of traditional prompts.

With Structure Reference now available on both web and mobile platforms, users can experiment with this innovative tool by visiting the Adobe Firefly website. This new feature represents a significant leap forward in the realm of generative AI, empowering users to bring their creative visions to life with ease and precision.
