OKX Withdraws from India: A Blow to Crypto Trading

OKX, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its departure from India. In an email to customers, the exchange cited ""local regulations"" as the reason for its withdrawal.

This move comes after Apple and Google removed the OKX app from their app stores in India. The decision was prompted by a statement from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency that accused several crypto exchanges of operating illegally in the country.

The FIU named Binance, Kraken, Huobi, and Gate.io as ""illegal"" operators but did not specifically mention OKX. Nevertheless, the exchange has instructed Indian customers to close all open positions and withdraw their funds by April 30th.

Regulatory Landscape and Tax Implications

India's regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has been evolving. In March 2022, the government brought digital assets under the purview of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations.

While domestic exchanges like CoinSwitch and CoinDCX have complied with these regulations, many international platforms have not. This has led to concerns about tax evasion, as India imposes a 30% tax on crypto gains and a 1% deduction on transactions.

Global Platforms and KYC Compliance

Global crypto exchanges have often operated with less stringent know-your-customer (KYC) requirements than their Indian counterparts. This has made them attractive to traders seeking to avoid taxes.

However, the Indian government's crackdown on illegal crypto activities has forced exchanges like Coinbase to halt user sign-ups in the country.

Impact on Indian Crypto Traders

OKX's withdrawal is a significant blow to Indian crypto traders who relied on the exchange for its wide range of coins and derivatives. It also raises concerns about the future of global crypto platforms in India.

The government's stance on cryptocurrencies remains unclear, and it is uncertain whether other exchanges will follow OKX's lead. Traders are advised to stay informed about regulatory developments and consider using compliant domestic exchanges for their crypto transactions.

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, it is essential for both traders and exchanges to adapt to changing regulations and ensure compliance. Only by working within the legal framework can the industry thrive and provide a safe and transparent environment for investors.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/21/the-inevitability-of-internet-monopolies/,The Inevitability Of Internet Monopolies," Google's Monopoly: Stifling Innovation, Eroding Relevance ","

The Rise and Fall of Google: How Monopolies Stifle Innovation

In the realm of the internet, Google emerged as an unparalleled titan, capturing over 90% of the search engine market share. Once hailed for its uncanny ability to surface the most relevant results, Google's magic has seemingly vanished.

The Erosion of Relevance

Over the years, users have noticed a gradual decline in the quality of Google's search results. Top spots are often occupied by advertisements or content that manipulates ranking algorithms. This shift is particularly concerning for research-oriented users like myself, who rely on unbiased information.

The Economics of Monopolies

The dominance of monopolies, like Google, often leads to complacency. Without viable alternatives, there is less incentive to provide exceptional services. This issue is further exacerbated when companies rely on advertising revenue, which can incentivize them to prioritize profits over user satisfaction.

The Monopoly Paradox: Value Scaling

The internet's unique characteristic, known as Metcalfe's Law, dictates that the value of a network grows exponentially with the number of its users. This has driven the consolidation of various networks into the single internet we know today.

Similarly, companies like Google and Amazon leverage this principle by collecting vast amounts of user data. By tracking our online behavior and purchases, they create a network of interconnected users, increasing their value and reinforcing their dominance.

Breaking the Monopoly Grip

While it may seem impossible to challenge the dominance of tech giants, there are steps we can take to encourage better service:

 Explore Alternatives: Venture beyond Google and try out second-place services like Bing or DuckDuckGo. They often offer innovative features or different perspectives.
 Embrace AI Tools: New-generation AI services like Perplexity AI and Wolfram Alpha provide alternative search and answer engines, offering ad-free experiences and enhanced capabilities.
 Support Regulatory Initiatives: Advocate for government regulations that aim to curb the power of tech monopolies and protect consumer interests.

Conclusion

The internet has become an essential part of our lives, but the dominance of a few monopolies threatens to stifle innovation and compromise user experience. By embracing alternatives, supporting regulatory initiatives, and demanding better service, we can restore balance to the digital landscape and ensure that the internet continues to serve the needs of all users.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-actuator-gen-robots.html,Researchers design a spring-assisted actuator that could enhance next-gen robots,Spring-Assisted Actuator Revolutionizes Motors for Robots and Assistive Devices,"

 Revolutionizing Motors for a More Efficient Future

In the realm of robotics, the demand for machines capable of executing complex and dynamic tasks has soared. However, conventional electric motors, designed for steady operations, fall short in these scenarios, wasting significant energy.

Researchers at Stanford University have devised an innovative solution: an energy-recycling actuator that augments electric motors, dramatically enhancing their efficiency for dynamic movements. This breakthrough opens up exciting possibilities for robots, assistive devices, and beyond.

 How It Works: Harnessing the Power of Springs

The actuator leverages the unique properties of springs, which store energy when stretched and release it upon release. By integrating clutches, the researchers can engage and disengage springs, allowing them to assist the motor during tasks.

For instance, when lowering a heavy object, the springs can be engaged to absorb some of the load, reducing the burden on the motor. Later, the stored energy in the stretched springs can be released to assist the motor in another task, minimizing energy consumption.

 Electroadhesive Clutches: The Key to Efficiency

The secret to the actuator's efficiency lies in its electroadhesive clutches. These clutches consist of two electrodes that slide past each other when inactive. To engage a clutch, a high voltage is applied, causing the electrodes to attract each other, locking the spring in place. Releasing the spring is equally simple, requiring only the removal of voltage.

 Benefits: Enhanced Efficiency and Autonomy

Tests conducted on a prototype actuator revealed remarkable results. Compared to a standard electric motor, the augmented motor consumed at least 50% less power, with a maximum reduction of 97%. This translates to robots that can operate for significantly longer durations without recharging.

 Applications: From Robotics to Assistive Devices

The energy-recycling actuator holds immense potential for a wide range of applications. Robots can now venture further and accomplish more with extended battery life. In hazardous environments, robots can safely perform tasks that would otherwise pose risks to humans.

Furthermore, assistive devices like prosthetics and exoskeletons can benefit from extended battery life, allowing users to enjoy greater mobility and independence.

 Future Prospects: Learning and Optimization

The researchers envision a future where the actuator's controller can learn from past tasks, creating a database of efficient movements. Artificial intelligence can then be employed to intuit the most effective way to execute new tasks.

With further refinements and commercialization, the energy-recycling actuator is poised to revolutionize the field of robotics and beyond. It promises to empower machines with greater efficiency, autonomy, and the ability to tackle complex tasks with ease.

Glassdoor's Anonymity Breach: A Cause for Concern

Glassdoor, the popular platform for anonymous company reviews, has come under fire for allegedly adding users' real names to their profiles without their consent. This breach of trust has raised concerns about the privacy and anonymity of its users.

According to one user, Monica, Glassdoor added her name and city to her profile after an email exchange with customer support. Despite never providing her name during signup, Glassdoor claimed to have obtained it from her email address.

Monica protested, arguing that Glassdoor had no right to use her personal information without her permission. However, Glassdoor insisted that users were ""required"" to have their names on their profiles, claiming it wouldn't compromise their past review anonymity.

This explanation fails to address the potential risks associated with such data collection. A data breach or legal process could expose users' identities, compromising their privacy and potentially leading to retaliation from employers.

Glassdoor's acquisition of Fishbowl, a semi-anonymous professional network, has further complicated the issue. Users who signed up for Fishbowl are now required to verify their identities, potentially increasing the risk of their Glassdoor data being linked to their real names.

Legal experts have expressed concern about Glassdoor's policies, which appear to conflict with its goal of encouraging candid employee reviews. The company's own admission that it cannot fully confirm the accuracy of user information raises questions about the purpose of data collection.

Another user, Josh Simmons, reported that Glassdoor added inaccurate information to his profile without his knowledge. This suggests that the data collection process may be automated and unreliable.

Glassdoor's response to these concerns has been inadequate. The company has provided vague statements without addressing specific questions about data verification and usage.

Users are left with the difficult choice of either having their names publicly associated with their reviews or deleting their accounts. Monica chose the latter, but it's important to note that deactivating an account does not fully delete it.

This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting our privacy online. Companies must be transparent about their data collection practices and respect users' rights to anonymity. Users should also be vigilant about protecting their personal information and consider the potential risks before sharing it with any platform.

Meteorologists: Guardians of Our Planet in the Face of Climate Change

March 23rd marks World Meteorological Day, a day dedicated to acknowledging the indispensable role that meteorologists play in safeguarding our planet and its inhabitants. This year's theme, ""At the Frontline of Climate Action,"" highlights the growing importance of meteorologists in addressing the pressing challenges posed by climate change.

Over the past few decades, meteorology has witnessed remarkable advancements, from sophisticated research to enhanced forecast models and long-term outlooks. However, a more recent and critical development lies in the convergence of weather and climate impacts, a field where meteorologists play a pivotal role in preparing the public, businesses, and policymakers for the uncertainties ahead.

Meteorologists: The Bridge Between Climate and Communities

The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development outlines ambitious goals aimed at eradicating hunger and poverty, improving health and well-being, ensuring access to clean water and energy, and enhancing community resilience to climate change. The World Meteorological Organization is spearheading efforts to recognize meteorologists' crucial role in achieving these objectives.

Research has irrefutably established that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have escalated the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. In the United States alone, billion-dollar weather disasters are now occurring nearly twice a month, a stark contrast to the 82-day gap between such events in the 1980s. In light of this alarming trend, meteorologists are tasked with providing critical weather insights to help businesses, municipalities, regulators, and government agencies prepare for and mitigate climate risks, both present and future.

Technology Empowers Meteorology's Expanding Role

Fortunately, technology is rapidly evolving to empower meteorologists in their mission to support businesses and communities. The fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques with weather intelligence has revolutionized predictive analysis, enabling proactive planning, preparation, and response to potential risks.

AI has proven particularly valuable in storm prediction. By combining historical weather data, weather models, and geographical and topographical information, AI algorithms can generate highly accurate, real-time forecasts. Energy companies, for instance, can leverage these insights to incorporate data on terrain, vegetation, electrical grids, and power failures into their wildfire prediction models. Armed with this knowledge, utilities can implement preventative measures, such as redistributing power or adjusting work orders in high-risk areas.

Supporting Communities in the Face of Climate Change

In line with the UN's sustainable development goals, municipalities are increasingly integrating weather analytics into their daily operations to enhance citizen protection and preparedness for extreme weather events.

Meteorologists can assist municipalities in identifying and mitigating risks associated with extreme temperature events. The past year, the hottest on record in the US, witnessed the devastating impact of heat waves on transportation, infrastructure, and human lives. Major cities across the country are appointing Chief Heat Officers to lead cooling strategies and develop response plans for rising temperatures and their consequences. These leaders rely heavily on accurate, real-time weather information and expert meteorological guidance to tailor emergency services accordingly.

Climate Risk Reporting: Holding Businesses Accountable

Meteorologists also play a crucial role in helping businesses identify and report climate risks. The Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of new climate risk disclosure rules underscores the growing recognition of climate change's financial implications. Public US-based companies are now required to disclose information about their emissions and other material risks, providing investors with a clearer understanding of the financial risks posed by climate change.

This new regulation emphasizes the shift towards acknowledging the reality of climate change and its impact on businesses. It standardizes information for investors and holds companies accountable for transparent reporting of potential risks.

These are just a few examples of the multifaceted ways in which meteorologists and the weather intelligence they provide are bridging the gap between environmental impacts and societal resilience. As we navigate an era of increasingly intense and frequent weather events, coupled with climate-attributed compound disasters, meteorology is poised to play an even more critical role in safeguarding the public, policymakers, and businesses against the challenges of a changing climate.

The Princess of Wales' Medical Records: A Breach of Trust?

In a concerning development, an investigation has been launched into allegations that the Princess of Wales' medical records may have been improperly accessed. This potential breach of security protocols has raised serious questions about patient privacy and the integrity of healthcare data.

The Allegations and Investigation

According to reports, staff at The London Clinic, where the Princess of Wales was treated in January, allegedly attempted to access her private medical records. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has confirmed that it is investigating the matter, assessing the information provided.

Legal Implications

If the breach is confirmed, the staff members involved could face legal consequences. Accessing patient records without the consent of the hospital data controller is a criminal offense.

Statement from The London Clinic

Al Russell, Chief Executive of The London Clinic, emphasized the importance of patient confidentiality. He stated that the hospital has systems in place to monitor the management of patient information and will take appropriate action in the event of a breach.

Possible Scenarios

While it is tempting to speculate about the source of the breach, there is currently no evidence to suggest that hackers were involved. Sources have indicated that the alleged breach may have occurred after the Princess of Wales' discharge from the hospital.

Cybersecurity in Healthcare

This incident highlights the crucial need for robust cybersecurity measures in healthcare. Javvad Malik, lead security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity hygiene and ethics. He argues that ongoing staff training is essential to mitigate insider threats.

ICO Investigation

The ICO's investigation will determine the extent of the breach and the potential criminality of the incident. Joe Jones, director of research and insights for the International Association of Privacy Professionals, believes the ICO's approach will serve as a reminder that employees with access to personal data must have the necessary permissions and legal right to use it.

Conclusion

The investigation into the alleged breach of the Princess of Wales' medical records is a sobering reminder of the importance of patient privacy and the need for strong cybersecurity measures in healthcare. The ICO's investigation will shed light on the circumstances surrounding the incident and determine the appropriate consequences for any wrongdoing.

The Future of CTV Advertising: Trends to Watch in 2024

Connected TV (CTV) is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the entertainment landscape. With its ability to deliver targeted ads to a captive audience, CTV offers advertisers a powerful tool to reach consumers. But as the CTV ecosystem continues to evolve, so too do the trends that shape it. Here are some key trends to watch in 2024:

1. The Rise of FAST Streaming

Subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) platforms like Netflix and Disney+ have become increasingly expensive. This has led to a surge in the popularity of FAST (free ad-supported) streaming services like Pluto TV and Tubi. In 2024, we can expect to see even more viewers switching to FAST platforms, creating new opportunities for advertisers.

2. The Growth of Shoppable Ads

Streaming platforms are making it easier for viewers to take action on ads. Roku and Disney have already introduced shoppable ad formats, and more services are expected to follow suit in 2024. This trend will benefit marketers by providing them with a way to drive immediate sales.

3. The Implementation of Open Measurement

Around 17% of ads delivered through CTV devices are played when the TV is off. This wastes advertising budgets. To address this issue, the IAB Tech Lab has released an open measurement SDK. In 2024, more publishers are expected to integrate this solution, allowing for more accurate CTV viewability measurement.

4. The Rise of Suitability Solutions

Advertisers are increasingly concerned about brand safety, and this is especially true in the CTV space. Suitability solutions provide advertisers with greater control over the content their ads are placed next to. In 2024, we can expect to see more publishers partnering with third-party verification providers to provide advertisers with video-level data access.

5. The Benefits of CTV for Publishers and Intermediaries

The growing demand for CTV ads provides publishers with a profitable opportunity to drive additional income. By joining programmatic platforms, publishers can automate the process of selling their ad inventory and delivering ads to their audiences. Ad exchanges and ad networks can also tap into the benefits of CTV evolution by offering different ad formats and sizes on their platforms.

Conclusion

The CTV landscape is constantly evolving, and it is essential for advertisers, publishers, and intermediaries to stay abreast of the latest trends. By doing so, they can adapt their strategies quickly and take advantage of the opportunities that CTV advertising has to offer.

This unique blend of skills allows Silence to identify and support startups that are truly driving innovation in the climate tech space.

Investing in the Future, One Startup at a Time

Since its inception, Silence has already invested in 22 promising companies. Their investment strategy is designed to provide startups with the resources they need to grow while maintaining a neutral and unbiased stance. By investing from pre-seed to Series A, Silence supports startups at crucial stages of their development.

Collaboration and Impact

Unlike traditional VCs, Silence does not compete with top-tier funds. Instead, they collaborate with them, participating in rounds led by renowned investors such as Point Nine, FifthWall, and Lowercarbon Capital. This approach allows Silence to access exclusive deals and support startups that have the potential to make a significant impact.

Portfolio Highlights

One standout investment is Cardino, a used EV marketplace that has experienced rapid growth. Silence's early investment in Cardino played a crucial role in the company's success, demonstrating their ability to identify and support promising startups.

A Focus on Scalable Solutions

Unlike many climate funds, Silence prioritizes investments in SaaS and marketplaces over deep tech ventures with long-term timeframes. Borja believes that these safer investments have the potential to create more value for the climate than moonshot bets that may or may not succeed.

Conclusion

Silence is a refreshing force in the climate tech investment landscape. Their unique approach, combined with their team of experts and collaborative mindset, is empowering climate startups to develop scalable solutions that can make a real difference in the fight against climate change. As Silence continues to invest and support promising startups, we can expect to see even more innovation and progress in this critical field.

 The Power of Imagination: Fighting Loneliness with Fictional Companions

Loneliness is a growing concern, affecting millions worldwide. While traditional methods of coping often focus on social interactions, some individuals are finding solace in the realm of imagination.

1. Reality Shifting: Escaping into Alternate Worlds

Reality shifting is a practice where individuals mentally transport themselves to fictional universes. By engaging in visualization and meditation, they aim to experience these worlds as if they were real. This practice has gained popularity, especially among younger generations, as a way to escape loneliness and connect with like-minded individuals.

While reality shifting can provide a sense of belonging and control, it's important to maintain a balance. Excessive immersion can lead to neglect of real-world responsibilities and relationships.

2. Fictophilia: Love for Fictional Characters

Fictophilia refers to the intense emotional attachment individuals feel towards fictional characters. These characters often become a source of comfort and support, providing an escape from the challenges of real-world relationships.

Fictophiles may engage in activities such as cosplaying, writing fan fiction, and creating art inspired by their beloved characters. While these relationships can be fulfilling, it's essential to recognize their limitations and avoid neglecting real-life connections.

3. Tulpamancy: Creating Imaginary Companions

Tulpamancy is the practice of creating sentient beings within one's mind. These ""tulpas"" are often described as having their own thoughts, feelings, and personalities. Individuals who engage in tulpamancy often interact with their tulpas as they would with real people.

Research suggests that tulpamancy can provide a sense of companionship and emotional support, especially for those with limited social interactions. However, it's important to approach this practice with mindfulness and recognize its potential impact on mental well-being.

Finding Balance: Imagination and Reality

While imagination can offer solace and connection, it's crucial to maintain a grounded perspective. Genuine relationships in the real world are essential for overall well-being.

If you find yourself struggling with loneliness, consider exploring these imaginative practices. However, remember to approach them with caution and seek professional help if necessary.

Remember, imagination can be a powerful tool for fighting loneliness, but it should complement, not replace, real-world connections. By balancing the two, you can create a fulfilling and meaningful life.
