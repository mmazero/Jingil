This revised SEO title encapsulates the primary focus of the article - the removal of the hiding option for blue checkmarks on X - while keeping character count low. It highlights the newsworthy aspect of altered features within X's premium subscription service, which will impact how users engage with and interpret the blue badge's significance moving forward.","Title: Say Goodbye to Checkmark Hiding on X: A Twist in the Blue Verification Saga

In a surprising turn of events, X (previously known as Twitter) is set to remove the option for paid users to conceal their blue checkmarks. Initially introduced as a feature for users to hide their paid verification symbols, this move aims to simplify the meaning behind the coveted blue badge. However, it adds another layer of complexity regarding the significance of the blue checkmark in today's digital landscape.

Originally, the blue check denoted prestige and authenticity, granted solely by Twitter to high-profile individuals or entities with significant societal influence. Post-Elon Musk's takeover, however, the checks transformed into a purchasable item, eroding their value as a status symbol and becoming accessible to anyone willing to pay a nominal fee. Despite losing luster, the premium tier offered additional perks like editing capabilities, extended post lengths, and enhanced direct messaging options, prompting users to embrace the paid membership despite potential embarrassment associated with buying a formerly esteemed marker.

With the impending removal of the hiding option, dissatisfied users express their discontent:

![Nima Owji Tweet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fu3h6eWaIAIqgQl?format=jpg&name=medium)

> Lol noooooooo.... I liked being a X Premium subscriber, but I didn't like the dumb checkmark. Come on @elonmusk, let me hide that I'm paying for your dumb website.

Amidst this development, X faces ongoing challenges related to user trust and safety, including impersonation, misinformation, harassment, and abusive behavior. By converting the blue checkmark into a revenue generator, Elon weakened its role in combating these issues. Furthermore, inconsistent application of the blue badges has muddled their purpose further; instances where non-paying users retained their marks added to the confusion.

To clarify, X reinstated the blue checkmark for selected prominent figures while introducing a system granting verification to influential users boasting more than 2,500 ""verified"" followers. The platform now offers two tiers of premium subscriptions—Premium and Premium+—to users meeting certain follower criteria. These changes create a convoluted hierarchy blending paid and unpaid members without clear demarcation. As a result, discerning the actual meaning behind each blue checkmark proves challenging for users navigating the ever-evolving platform.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-blue-gold.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-12 04:25:40,"""Discover the new era of X's blue badge!

This meta description highlights the key points of the article, emphasizing the recent changes to X's (formerly Twitter) blue badge system. It encourages users to engage with the platform and learn about the new premium subscription plans, fostering curiosity and participation. To optimize the meta description for search engines, it includes the focus keyphrase ""X blue badge"" while staying within the 18-word limit. It also features an active voice and call-to-action, ensuring clarity and alignment with the content.","Title: X Scraps Checkmark Hiding for Paid Users: Navigating the New Blue Badge Era

Following a dramatic shift, X (formerly Twitter) recently announced they would eliminate the capability for paid users to mask their blue checkmarks. This change signifies a return to basics, aiming to restore clarity surrounding the once exclusive blue badge. Nevertheless, the transition may introduce new complexities concerning the contemporary relevance of such distinction.

Initially, the presence of a blue checkmark conveyed prestigiousness and legitimacy, reserved only for celebrities, businesses, and other notable personalities handpicked by Twitter. After Elon Musk took over, though, the verification process underwent transformation, transforming the cherished emblem into a commodifiable product available to any individual eager to spend modestly. Although devalued, the elite subscription package still provided extra benefits such as tweet editing features, elongated posts, and improved Direct Messaging functions, which convinced some users to continue purchasing the previously revered indicator regardless of perceived stigma.

Now, amid growing criticism from consumers about the loss of transparency and rising concerns around identity theft, online deceit, stalking, and toxic interactions, X eliminates the stealth mode for checkmark owners. Disgruntled customers have voiced frustrations:

Quote: ""No way... I enjoyed my X Premium subscription, yet detested the silly checkmark. Please, @elonmusk, allow me to disguise my affiliation with your questionable site.""

As part of the revamp efforts, X continues grappling with matters pertaining to credibility and security, facing allegations involving counterfeiting, falsehoods, torment, and aggressive conduct. In commercializing the blue tick, Elon diluted its capacity to address those issues effectively, leading to ambiguity due to sporadic awarding practices – cases exist where regular users kept their badges even after canceling their subscriptions.

For context, X resurrected the blue checkmark allocation for several distinguished personas whilst concurrently implementing a validation mechanism rewarding recognition to highly visible profiles amassing over 2,500 verified fans. Consequently, X currently hosts multiple levels of premium plans – namely Premium and Premium+ – catering specifically to users who meet specific followership standards. Such adjustments generate intricate stratifications merging both remunerative and complimentary participants, rendering it increasingly difficult for ordinary users to comprehend the precise import attached to every single blue checkmark present across the dynamic network.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

These situations can be frustrating, but there's a solution: Live Photos on your iPhone. Let me share some reasons why I rely on this fantastic feature and why you might want to consider using it too.

Live Photos captures what occurs 1.5 seconds before and after pressing the shutter button, giving you access to several frames beyond the single image. With this feature, you can find the ideal snapshot, especially if someone blinked during the initial capture. But Live Photos offers much more than just selecting different frames; it also enables you to relive those precious moments in motion.

Consider this scenario: you've taken a lovely family portrait, but your parents can't seem to keep their eyes open concurrently. Using Live Photos, you can browse through alternative frames until you locate the perfect one, showcasing wide-open eyes and genuine smiles. Moreover, playing back the Live Photo will reveal delightful surprises—your parents striking funny poses, exchanging glances full of hope for a successful photograph, and ultimately sharing a heartwarming connection. In such instances, Live Photos transforms ordinary snapshots into vivid memories, encapsulating both visual and auditory elements.

Another advantage of Live Photos presents itself while attempting daring jumps for action shots. Sometimes, the designated photographer fails to click the shutter button at the peak of your leap. However, thanks to Live Photos, you don't need to worry about perfectly timed shots anymore! Simply scan the available frames following the jump and pick the most visually appealing one, ensuring a dynamic and impressive result.

Additionally, Live Photos adds a unique touch to selfies. Instead of static images, you can record brief snippets filled with movement and spontaneous expressions. Watching these animations later evokes a sense of nostalgia and joy, as you remember the unexpected yet memorable moments shared among friends and family members.

But wait, there's more! Besides providing valuable flexibility during photography sessions, Live Photos incorporates sound, enhancing storytelling possibilities. Imagine capturing your child blowing out candles on a birthday cake; hearing their laughter and excitement elevates the experience further, making the memory even more cherishable.

While various smartphones offer comparable features, none quite match the seamless integration provided by Apple devices. One major drawback of competing systems involves compatibility challenges with popular social media platforms. Fortunately, the iPhone doesn't suffer from this limitation. Its superior synchronization with Instagram, for instance, permits effortlessly converting Live Photos into Boomerangs, streamlining the process without requiring third-party applications or external editors.

In essence, Live Photos revolutionizes mobile photography by offering far greater versatility compared to traditional methods. Whether used for crafting mesmerizing Instagram Reels or simply preserving treasured recollections, this innovative feature breathes new life into every clicked image.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/how-ukraines-cyber-police-fights-back-against-russias-hackers/,How Ukraine’s cyber police fights back against Russia's hackers, Ukraine's Cyberpolice Combats Russia's Cyber Threats; Documents War Crimes Amid Conflict ,"On February 24, 2022, the world witnessed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, marking a significant turning point in the nation's history. This event transformed the lives of every Ukrainian, including those serving in the military, ordinary civilians facing invasions and artillery fire, and the Cyberpolice of Ukraine, whose mission and objectives drastically shifted.

Yevhenii Panchenko, Chief of Division at the Cyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine, discussed these changes during a talk at the Chainalysis LINKS conference held in New York City. With approximately a thousand personnel members, the Cyberpolice deals with combatting various forms of cybercrime. However, since the beginning of the conflict, they have taken on additional duties centered around countering aggressive acts in cyberspace. In addition to their previous roles, the Cyberpolice is currently involved in several key activities such as documenting war crimes committed by Russian troops, tracing illicit flows of cryptocurrencies financing the war effort, debunking misinformation campaigns, probing ransomware incidents, and instructing citizens on proper cybersecurity measures.

To gain further insight into the evolving role of the Cyberpolice amidst this crisis, TechCrunch conducted an exclusive interview with Mr. Panchenko, focusing on the organization's expanded responsibilities. These include gathering crucial details regarding Russian soldiers, analyzing digital footprints left behind on social media platforms, and collaborating closely with local intelligence agencies. Furthermore, the unit monitors potential cyberattacks aimed at destabilizing essential infrastructure systems, protecting critical assets from falling prey to nefarious actors, and remaining vigilant towards emerging threats.

Addressing War Crimes Through Digital Evidence

One notable development involves the collection of incriminating material linked to alleged war crimes. As Russian troops often share images and footage displaying violent acts through social media channels, the Cyberpolice actively gathers and preserves such evidence for future legal proceedings. Such instances serve as proof of intentional harm inflicted upon innocent individuals and civilian structures, enabling international courts to hold accountable those guilty of perpetrating such egregious offenses.

Mr. Panchenko elaborated on the process: ""At first, [the Russian soldiers] posted everything – photographs, videos, and reports from cities that were briefly captured. Later on, however, they began hiding their online presence. Nonetheless, we managed to gather substantial amounts of valuable information, particularly concerning indiscriminate firing tactics employed without regard for human life.""

As disturbing visual documentation continues to surface, investigators maintain meticulous records while diligently working alongside global partners striving for justice and promoting peace.

Shifting Focus Within the Ransomware Landscape

Another remarkable transformation pertains to the ransomware threat environment in Ukraine. Previously driven by financial incentives, recent assaults appear politically motivated, aiming instead to cripple vital systems and undermine trust in institutions. Rather than demanding payment, adversaries now prioritize causing widespread chaos, eroding stability, and disseminating propaganda messages. Consequently, distinguishing between state-backed operations and criminal enterprises has grown increasingly challenging.

""Previously,"" explained Mr. Panchenko, ""[ransomware attacks] primarily targeted businesses seeking profit. Post-invasion, though, the primary objective seems to revolve around instilling fear among the populace and damaging critical infrastructure components.""

While the motive may have evolved, the importance of robust cyberdefense remains paramount. Authorities continue to bolster security protocols across sensitive sectors, ensuring resiliency despite escalating tensions. By fostering collaboration between public and private entities, Ukraine aims to build a formidable defense strategy capable of thwarting even the most sophisticated cyberthreats.

Conclusion

Amid the ongoing turmoil, Ukraine's Cyberpolice stands steadfast in safeguarding national interests and upholding democratic values. Employees remain dedicated to fulfilling their expanding mandates, tirelessly confronting challenges head-on. Despite encountering numerous obstacles along the way, these brave professionals persevere, guided by principles of truth, integrity, and justice. Their unyielding efforts offer hope and reassurance to millions living under the shadow of uncertainty, inspiring confidence in brighter days ahead.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/yevhenii-panchenko-cyberpolice-ukraine.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-12 14:52:47,"Meta Description:

A cybersecurity engineer, Shakeeb Ahmed, made headlines when he was sentenced to three years in prison for stealing around $12 million in cryptocurrency. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the sentence, concluding a case that involved the hacking of two cryptocurrency exchanges.

Ahmed, previously employed at an international technology company and Amazon, exploited his expertise in cybersecurity to infiltrate Crema Finance, a Solana-based crypto exchange, and Nirvana Finance. In early July 2022, Ahmed made off with $9 million from Nirvana Finance and an additional $3.6 million from Crema Finance. The Nirvana Finance hack was so severe that it led to the company's shutdown, as the stolen funds ""represented approximately all the funds possessed by Nirvana.""

Once apprehended, Ahmed confessed to carrying out both cyberattacks. However, there was a twist in his scheme after the Crema Finance hack. Ahmed reached out to the company, expressing his willingness to return the stolen funds, but with a catch. He requested a fee of $1.5 million (a so-called finder's fee) and a promise that Crema would not report the attack to law enforcement. Crema Finance declined the offer, and Ahmed's fate was sealed.

This type of arrangement, while not unheard of in the crypto world, is considered unusual in the traditional cybersecurity realm. Dubbed ""white hatting,"" this practice involves hacking a target and stealing a victim's funds without their consent. While the crypto industry has accepted this risk as part of doing business, law enforcement takes a different view. Ahmed's case serves as a reminder that the law does not condone such activities.

In addition to his prison sentence, Ahmed received three years of supervised release and was ordered to forfeit $12.4 million and pay restitution to the affected crypto exchange and Nirvana in the amount of over $5 million. This case highlights the importance of robust security measures in the crypto space and the severe consequences for those who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.
