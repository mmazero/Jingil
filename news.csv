https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/ransomware-attack-change-healthcare-prescription-pharmacy-outages/,Ransomware attack blamed for Change Healthcare outage stalling US prescriptions,"

In the realm of digital security, a recent cyberattack has sent shockwaves through the U.S. healthcare industry, causing disruptions and outages across hospitals and pharmacies. The culprit behind this digital siege? A notorious ransomware group known as BlackCat, also referred to as ALPHV.

Change Healthcare, a prominent healthcare tech giant, fell victim to this malicious attack, resulting in widespread disruptions to prescription processing and billing systems. The company's executives attributed the cyberattack to BlackCat, a group known for its aggressive tactics and data encryption demands.

While BlackCat has not yet publicly claimed responsibility, their modus operandi typically involves stealing sensitive data before encrypting it, leaving victims scrambling to recover their information. The extent of patient data compromise remains uncertain at this time.

UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Change Healthcare, initially hinted at a ""suspected nation-state"" threat actor, but the accuracy of this attribution remains unclear. Cybersecurity experts have not previously linked BlackCat to any specific government or state.

Change Healthcare stands as a crucial player in the U.S. healthcare system, processing an astounding 15 billion healthcare transactions annually, equivalent to one-third of all U.S. patient records. This attack serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist in our increasingly interconnected digital infrastructure.

The ramifications of this cyberattack have been far-reaching, with hospitals, healthcare providers, and pharmacies struggling to fulfill prescriptions and process insurance claims. The American Hospital Association issued a stern warning to its members, urging them to disconnect from Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, until its systems are deemed safe.

Columbia University, renowned for its esteemed medical facilities, took immediate action by severing all connections to UnitedHealth Group, Change Healthcare, and Optum, effectively blocking access to their email domains.

The impact of this cyberattack has extended beyond the U.S. borders, affecting military pharmacies worldwide and select retail pharmacies across the nation. Tricare, the U.S. military's health insurance provider, confirmed the disruptions caused by the attack.

BlackCat's notoriety extends beyond this recent incident, with previous high-profile targets including Norton, Reddit, and Fidelity National Financial. Their reputation for audacious cyberattacks continues to grow, leaving organizations scrambling to protect their digital assets.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/inkitt-ai-publishing-37-million/,"Inkitt, a self-publishing platform using AI to develop bestsellers, books $37M led by Khosla","

In the vast expanse of storytelling, every individual holds a tale worth sharing. Embracing this belief, the innovative platform of choice, known as ""Inkitt,"" seeks to transform these narratives into cinematic masterpieces, mirroring the success of the entertainment empire, ""Disney,"" in the digital age.

With its user-friendly app, aspiring storytellers can effortlessly publish their creations, allowing the platform's AI-powered algorithms to meticulously select the most captivating tales for further refinement and subsequent distribution on a sister app known as ""Galatea.""

Inkitt's remarkable journey has garnered a devoted following of 33 million users and propelled numerous titles to the coveted bestseller list. The recently secured $37 million in Series C funding will fuel the expansion of its content horizons, encompassing AI-generated stories, reader-tailored adaptations, and a foray into games, audiobooks, and video adaptationsâ€”initially crafted by human hands, eventually evolving towards AI-generated prowess.

Inkitt's unwavering vision, as articulated by its CEO and co-founder, Ali Albazaz, is to cultivate a vast library of captivating content and establish a multimedia empire that extends beyond the boundaries of traditional storytelling. Envisioning a literary empire akin to ""the Disney of the 21st century,"" he envisions a captivating world of stories that resonate with diverse readers.

The $37 million Series C funding round was spearheaded by Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, joined by previous supporters, NEA, and Kleiner Perkins, alongside undisclosed investors. This latest investment propels the total funds raised by the company to an impressive $117 million, encompassing a $3.9 million seed round, a $16 million Series A, and a $59 million Series B.

Inkitt's aspirations stand in stark contrast to the prevailing trends in the literary landscape. With the advent of mobile devices and attention-grasping apps, traditional reading habits have dwindled over the past two decades. In 2022, the average American adult devoted a mere 15 minutes per day to reading, a significant decline from the 20-minute average in previous years. The average number of books read (and completed) has also plummeted to approximately five per year.

Defying these trends, ""Inkitt"" boldly wagers on the enduring allure of storytelling. The platform seeks to captivate readers with innovative approaches, including shorter, mobile-friendly chapters, and dynamic reading experiences enhanced by immersive effects such as sound.

Furthermore, ""Inkitt"" tailors its literary selections to the preferences of its readers, conducting rigorous A/B testing across various elements of the narrative, from titles and story arcs to opening lines and climactic twists. This meticulous approach amassing a wealth of data not only on specific books but also on the overall performance of fiction genres, illuminating patterns of success that can be swiftly applied to subsequent publications.

These strategies have yielded remarkable results, propelling ""Inkitt,"" ""Galatea,"" and the recently launched ""Galatea TV"" to unprecedented levels of engagement. Despite the waning popularity of pandemic-era conveniences like instant deliveries and virtual events, these platforms have experienced a sustained surge in user engagement.

Ali Albazaz attributes this success to the yearning for escapism in the contemporary landscape. With so many distractions vying for attention, individuals seek respite in captivating stories, a void that ""Inkitt"" effectively fills.

Furthermore, ""Inkitt"" ranks among the top 11 bestselling publishers worldwide, surpassing industry giants like Penguin Random House. Albazaz attributes this achievement to the platform's algorithms, which boast a ""20x"" higher success rate in generating bestselling titles compared to traditional publishers.

Revenue has experienced a twofold increase over the past year, although specific figures remain undisclosed. While nascent ventures like ""Galatea TV"" serve as offshoots of the core reading enterprise, they have yielded significant returns in their own capacity. For instance, a TV series adaptation of the ""Galatea"" book titled ""Beautiful Mistake"" has generated revenue of $500,000. Albazaz anticipates the company's imminent profitability.

Headquartered in Berlin but firmly rooted in San Francisco, ""Inkitt"" predominantly focuses on fiction. However, it would be inaccurate to categorize the platform solely within the literary fiction genre. Following an unpleasant encounter with a famous author who balked at ""Inkitt's"" suggested edits for an upcoming novel, Albazaz prefers to avoid the headaches associated with catering to established authors and their inflated egos. Instead, the platform embraces the vast pool of undiscovered talent, nurturing their potential toward stardom.

The question remains: how receptive will this long tail of undiscovered talent be to the dictates of algorithms? Albazaz envisions AI-generated stories, derived from captivating treatments crafted by skilled human writers, as a significant component of the platform's future endeavors.

Personalization remains a fluid concept, with ""Inkitt"" experimenting with various degrees of alterations that can be implemented on an original work, even potentially relinquishing control to the readers themselves. To realize this vision, the company has collaborated with various LLMs, including popular AI platforms like OpenAI, Anthoptic, and Mistral AI (Albazaz's current favorite for shorter texts).

Each book is automatically translated into 10 languages, with DeepL serving as the primary AI facilitator. For audiobooks, ""Inkitt"" utilizes ElevenLabs' text-to-speech voice generator, while Leonardo handles cover art (a recent switch from Midjourney, as Albazaz notes). This strategic mix of technologies is designed to achieve optimal results.

Albazaz acknowledges the shortcomings of LLMs in their current state, acknowledging that they often generate mediocre to average content on their own. However, he emphasizes the crucial role of ""Inkitt's"" extensive data, accrued over years, in refining and transforming these AI-generated stories into captivating masterpieces.

Interestingly, intellectual property concerns also drive this cautious approach. ""Inkitt"" is wary of relying on a single LLM for an entire novel, given the ongoing debate surrounding proprietary data usage in training these AI models. To mitigate any potential risks, the platform occasionally employs intentionally ambiguous prompts to avoid inadvertently feeding the LLMs with too much information about ""Inkitt's"" most successful works.

Despite these challenges, ""Inkitt"" has successfully navigated the turbulent waters of the digital landscape, discovering new opportunities to thrive. Its unwavering focus on constructing an AI-powered content empire resonated with its lead investors, including Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, who envisions a hyper-personalized future of entertainment.

While Vinod Khosla declined an interview request, he provided a statement echoing his belief in the transformative potential of AI in the entertainment industry. He sees ""Inkitt's"" mission and track record of success as a testament to the platform's ability to deliver highly individualized and meaningful content to each individual.

SpaceX's Starship: A Journey of Progress and Peril

In a significant development, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has concluded its review of SpaceX's investigation into the second Starship launch in November. The regulator has accepted the company's identified root causes and corrective actions, paving the way for SpaceX to resume Starship flights.

While the investigation is now closed, SpaceX must implement all the corrective actions and apply for a modified launch license before it can fly Starship again. The FAA is currently evaluating SpaceX's license modification request and expects additional information before making a final determination.

The second orbital flight test of the nearly 400-foot-tall Starship rocket in November was a milestone, with all 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster performing flawlessly during the ascent burn. The company also successfully executed a spectacular ""hot-stage separation,"" wherein the Starship upper stage ignited to separate from the booster.

However, similar to the first test in April, the flight ended in a fiery explosion mid-air. This triggered a mishap investigation led by SpaceX and reviewed by regulators to analyze the failure and ensure corrective actions are implemented. After the first test, SpaceX was directed to complete 63 corrective actions.

The company identified seven changes to the booster and 10 to the Starship vehicle, focusing on hardware redesigns, system modeling updates, and operational changes. These modifications aim to increase robustness, reduce complexity, eliminate pre-second engine cutoff propellant dumps, and enhance fire protection.

In a post-launch postmortem, SpaceX revealed that the likely cause of the booster's explosion was a filter blockage in one of the Raptor engines, leading to an energetic engine failure and total loss of the booster. The Starship upper stage met its demise due to a propellant leak that caused a fire, severing communication between the onboard computers and triggering the autonomous flight termination system.

SpaceX has already incorporated some of these hardware changes and design upgrades into the vehicles for the third orbital flight test, which could take place as early as the second week of March, according to CEO Elon Musk.

SpaceX's goal is to complete the full mission profile, including a controlled splashdown of the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico and a landing of the Starship in the Pacific Ocean. With each test flight, SpaceX gains valuable insights and makes improvements, moving closer to its ultimate goal of developing a fully reusable launch system capable of carrying satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to various orbits and landing sites.

In the realm of gadgets, each device has a distinct purpose. Toasters brown bread, smartphones connect users, and dashcams record journeys. However, the Ring Car Cam faced an identity crisis from the start. After three and a half years, Amazon discontinued the device, signaling its end.

The Ring Car Cam aimed to be more than just a surveillance tool; it aspired to be an ever-present guardian on wheels, extending home security into the automotive realm. But the question remained: who was it for? This lack of a clear target audience became a significant hurdle.

Startups often disrupt stagnant markets, and the Ring Car Cam could have done just that. But knowing your customers is crucial, and the Ring Car Cam struggled to find a foothold in any specific domain.

As a dashcam, its $199 price tag and $6 monthly subscription fee were steep compared to other options. While it had innovations like the OBD-II port and ""traffic stop"" mode, these features weren't compelling enough for most users.

The Ring Car Cam's appeal was limited to those deeply invested in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. However, it's hard to imagine someone trusting their vehicle's safety solely to this device.

Amazon's decision to discontinue the Ring Car Cam may prompt a reassessment of consumer expectations for dashcams and automotive security devices. As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, drivers are accustomed to having constant video coverage of their vehicles.

Tesla promised to make its Sentry Mode accessible remotely through the Ring Car Connect product, but the project seems to have fizzled out. The discontinuation of the Ring Car Cam likely seals the fate of this collaboration.

The Ring Car Cam's demise serves as a reminder that even in the tech world, finding a clear purpose and target audience is essential for success.

Venture Capital Fund of Funds: QIA's Bold Move to Cultivate Innovation

In a remarkable move, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has unveiled a $1 billion venture capital fund of funds, aiming to transform Qatar and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region into a thriving hub for startups and innovation. This strategic initiative seeks to attract international venture capital funds and startups, with a keen focus on fintech, edtech, and healthcare sectors.

QIA's fund-of-funds structure will invest indirectly through other VC funds, while also engaging in targeted co-investments. This move is driven by a desire to bolster the number of startups and enhance the availability of venture capital funding within Qatar, bridging the gap with more established ecosystems in neighboring countries.

Gulf sovereign wealth funds, such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, ADQ, Mubadala, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, have collectively invested over $73 billion across various asset classes in 2022. These funds are increasingly pouring money into tech startups in the GCC region, aiming to nurture thriving venture capital industries and reduce reliance on oil.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/lockbit-ransomware-takedown-now-what/,"Feds hack LockBit, LockBit springs back. Now what?","

In the world of cybercrime, the notorious LockBit ransomware group, hailing from Russia, has made a startling comeback after a brief hiatus caused by a massive law enforcement operation. The group's dark web leak site is back up and running, adorned with a fresh list of victims, signaling their resilience and determination to continue their malicious activities.

In a rambling statement, the remaining LockBit administrator pointed the finger at their own negligence for the disruption they faced. A global law enforcement effort, dubbed ""Operation Cronos,"" successfully infiltrated and seized control of LockBit's infrastructure, including their dark web leak site. The operation resulted in the takedown of multiple servers across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S., the seizure of cryptocurrency wallets, and the arrest of alleged LockBit members in Poland and Ukraine.

Despite this setback, LockBit swiftly announced the resumption of its operations, claiming to have restored from backups unaffected by the government takedown. The group's administrator vowed retaliation, threatening to target the government sector.

However, law enforcement agencies, particularly the National Crime Agency (NCA), which spearheaded Operation Cronos, maintain that LockBit's systems have been compromised and destroyed. They assert that the group's demise has been greatly exaggerated.

The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and cybercriminals continues, with both sides exchanging bold claims and promises. The NCA has promised to reveal the identity of LockBit's elusive leader, known as ""LockBitSupp,"" but details remain scarce. U.S. law enforcement agencies have offered a substantial reward for information leading to the identification or location of key LockBit leaders, suggesting that they lack concrete evidence against them.

The LockBit takedown, while celebrated as a significant victory, may not be the end of the story. Ransomware gangs have a history of regrouping and rebranding after law enforcement disruptions. Similar incidents involving other ransomware groups like ALPHV (BlackCat), Hive, and Conti have shown that these groups can simply re-form under different names and continue their operations.

LockBit's defiant statement claims that law enforcement only obtained a limited number of decryptors, arrested the wrong individuals, and failed to take down all of their websites. The group vowed to enhance its security measures, manually release decryptors, and maintain its affiliate program.

The NCA acknowledges that LockBit will likely attempt to rebuild its systems and continues to work on disrupting the group's activities. The agency has gathered intelligence about LockBit and its associates, indicating that the fight against this cybercrime syndicate is far from over.

The resurgence of LockBit serves as a stark reminder that the battle against ransomware is an ongoing one. Despite law enforcement efforts, these groups continue to adapt and persist, posing a constant threat to individuals, businesses, and organizations worldwide.

In the realm of social media, Instagram's Threads app is making strides to emulate its rival, X. Recent updates include trending topics, an in-app camera, drafts, and now, a bookmarking feature that allows users to privately save posts for later reference.

Bookmarking has been a popular feature among X users and avid news consumers. It enables them to curate a collection of links and posts for future reference, whether it's a long article they intend to read or a significant piece of information they want to recall.

While X's bookmarking icon is conveniently located at the bottom of each post, Threads' new feature is slightly more concealed. Instead of saving a post from the main timeline, users must tap the three-dot menu to access the ""Save"" option.

To revisit saved posts, users can navigate to the app's Settings screen.

Upon announcing the new feature via Threads, some users expressed their disappointment in the comments, stating that they still lacked access to this and other recently announced features. Instagram is rolling out these updates in phases, gradually expanding availability to the entire Threads user base. This approach is partly due to Threads' limited engineering resources compared to other Meta platforms and the app's substantial user base of 130 million monthly active users.

In addition to bookmarks, Threads users have spotted other new features. Some have noticed that they now receive notifications from Threads and Facebook within their Instagram notifications. In an effort to expand the app's reach, Threads has also begun testing a cross-posting feature from Facebook to Threads.

As Threads continues to evolve, it's clear that Instagram is determined to position it as a formidable competitor to X. By introducing features that cater to users' needs and preferences, Threads aims to carve out a niche for itself in the ever-changing landscape of social media.
