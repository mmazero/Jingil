In a world saturated with social media apps that prioritize likes, followers, and constant content creation, a new app called Lapse is offering a refreshing alternative. Inspired by the simplicity and charm of analog photography, Lapse takes users back to a time when taking pictures was about capturing moments, not chasing perfection.

With Lapse, you can take photos that you have to wait to see ""developed,"" just like in the old days. There's no chance to edit or retake the shot, adding an element of anticipation and excitement to the process. Once developed, you can share your photos with a select group of friends, creating a more intimate and meaningful sharing experience.

Lapse has gained significant traction, boasting millions of users, 100 million photos captured each month, and a consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photographic apps. This success has attracted a new round of funding of $30 million, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, with participation from previous backers.

The company plans to use this funding to enhance the photo experience, add more features, and eventually expand into video. While monetization is a potential consideration, Lapse aims to avoid the traditional advertising route that many social apps rely on.

Behind the scenes, Lapse employs a series of 12 processing steps to optimize the photos, using elements of computer vision and a combination of in-house and third-party technology. This ensures that subjects and compositions look their best, without compromising the app's commitment to authenticity.

However, Lapse has faced scrutiny for its initial growth tactics, which involved growth-hacking and forced invites. While these methods helped boost the app's user base, they raised concerns about sustainability and user-friendliness.

In response, Lapse has shifted away from forced invites and now relies on organic growth and word-of-mouth. The app has evolved into a journaling platform, allowing users to create private or shareable albums with their close friends.

Lapse's unique approach addresses a growing consumer demand for simpler, more authentic social media experiences. With its focus on capturing and sharing real moments, Lapse offers a refreshing alternative to the polished and often staged content that dominates many other platforms.

As Jacob Andreou, a general partner at Greylock, observes, ""There's a hole where there is no place where you can go to just check out your friends' profiles, see what they're up to. That's also an amazing place to start because that's where all these really big platforms started.""

Lapse's success and the support of its investors suggest that there's a significant market for apps that prioritize authenticity, simplicity, and meaningful connections. Whether it can sustain its momentum and carve out a lasting niche in the ever-evolving social media landscape remains to be seen, but Lapse is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air in a world of increasingly complex and cluttered social platforms.

Lapse: The Analogue Charm in a Digital Age

In an era defined by digital convenience, a startup called Lapse is offering a refreshing throwback to the days of analogue photography. With its unique app, Lapse allows smartphone users to experience the charm and simplicity of film photography, minus the hefty price tag.

A Glimpse into the Lapse Experience

Lapse users capture photos that they can't immediately see. Instead, they must wait for the photos to ""develop,"" just like in the old days. This process adds an element of suspense and anticipation to the photography experience. Once developed, the photos can be shared with a select group of friends, creating a more intimate and meaningful sharing experience.

Gaining Traction and Funding

Lapse has gained significant traction in the market, boasting millions of users and a top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photographic apps. This success has attracted a new round of funding worth $30 million, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners. With this funding, Lapse aims to enhance its photo experience, explore video capabilities, and potentially introduce monetization strategies that deviate from traditional advertising models.

Behind the Scenes: The Art of Unedited Photos

Lapse's unedited photos are not simply raw images. The app employs a series of 12 processing steps, including elements of computer vision, to optimize the composition and appearance of the subjects. This behind-the-scenes treatment ensures that photos look their best, without compromising the authenticity and spontaneity of the analogue experience.

Growth Strategies and Ethical Considerations

Lapse initially employed growth-hacking techniques, such as forced invites, to expand its user base. While this strategy helped the app gain visibility, it also raised concerns about sustainability and user-friendliness. Lapse has since moved away from these practices, recognizing the importance of organic growth and user satisfaction.

A Gap in the Market: The Rise of Simple Alternatives

Lapse's success highlights a growing demand for simpler alternatives to mainstream social media platforms. Users are increasingly wary of the privacy concerns and overwhelming features that often accompany these platforms. Lapse offers a refreshing antidote, focusing on genuine connections and authentic sharing experiences.

The Future of Lapse: A Place for Friends and Real Moments

Lapse's investors see the potential for the app to fill a void in the social media landscape. They envision Lapse as a platform where users can reconnect with the essence of friendship, sharing real moments without the pressure of likes, filters, or endless scrolling.

Conclusion: A Nostalgic Revival with a Modern Twist

Lapse is a unique app that combines the charm of analogue photography with the convenience of smartphones. It offers a refreshing alternative to the fast-paced, image-obsessed world of social media, encouraging users to capture and share life's moments in a more authentic and meaningful way. As Lapse continues to evolve, it has the potential to redefine the way we connect with friends and document our lives in the digital age.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/threads-widens-the-gap-with-x-with-triple-the-daily-downloads-on-ios/,"Threads widens the gap with X, with triple the daily downloads on iOS","

In the realm of social media, a fierce battle is unfolding between Instagram's Threads and X (formerly Twitter), each vying for dominance in the microblogging arena. While X holds a legacy of leadership, Threads has emerged as a strong contender, consistently outperforming its rival in terms of daily downloads.

Threads' meteoric rise can be attributed to Meta's strategic efforts to drive traffic to its new platform. Initially, the app experienced fluctuating downloads as Meta experimented with various promotional tactics. However, Threads' fortunes took a turn for the better towards the end of last year, with daily installs surpassing those of X across both iOS and Google Play.

As of February 2024, Threads boasts nearly triple the daily downloads of X on iOS and more than double on Google Play. This widening gap suggests a gradual shift in user preference towards Threads, potentially signaling a change in the microblogging landscape.

Meta's dominance in this space would grant it significant control over information sharing and news dissemination, particularly among journalists, researchers, and news enthusiasts. However, Meta's stance against amplifying news and recommending political content on Threads raises questions about the platform's role in shaping public discourse.

Currently, Threads counts 130 million monthly active users, a figure that is likely to grow in the coming weeks. Its success in Japan, a market where Twitter once held sway, further underscores Threads' global appeal.

In contrast, X faces challenges related to its rebranding and a potential issue with bot accounts. While monthly downloads saw a slight uptick in December and January, they remain significantly lower compared to the pre-rebranding period.

Decentralized X alternatives, such as Mastodon and Bluesky, have yet to make a substantial impact, with their download numbers dwarfed by those of Threads and X. However, Bluesky's recent launch and its embrace of federation, allowing anyone to run their own server, hold promise for future growth.

The alt-Twitter wars continue to unfold, with Threads emerging as a formidable challenger to X's long-standing reign. As the battle for microblogging supremacy rages on, it remains to be seen which platform will ultimately capture the hearts and minds of users worldwide.

In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile technology, a new wave of innovation is emerging at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2024. Jolla, a rejuvenated startup, is making a bold move by introducing a groundbreaking AI device that promises to revolutionize the way we interact with data and privacy.

Jolla's AI device, dubbed ""JollaMind²,"" is a compact and sleek black box that aims to be a personal cloud and AI router, granting users secure access to their data for running AI queries. This device is envisioned as a private and secure ""blackbox for your life,"" designed to address the growing concerns surrounding data privacy and security in the age of generative AI.

The device's core concept is to keep users' data within their control, allowing them to harness the power of AI without compromising their privacy. It functions as a personal server, providing a secure platform for AI processing, eliminating the need to rely on third-party cloud services.

Jolla's AI device is powered by open-source AI large language models, including Meta's LLaMA 2, which serves as the foundation for its generative AI capabilities. The company's focus is on developing the user interface and function design, leveraging the capabilities of these powerful AI models.

The device aims to provide users with a comprehensive AI assistant that can respond intelligently to natural language queries and proactively surface insights by drawing upon trusted access to the user's mobile data and digital services. This AI-powered assistant can perform various tasks, such as email triage, calendar management, and smart minutes generation, all while maintaining the privacy and security of the user's data.

Jolla's mission is to empower individuals with the benefits of advanced AI without sacrificing their privacy. The device is designed to be a secure hub where users can process their data without the risk of it being shared with third parties.

The company's co-founder, Antti Saarnio, emphasizes the importance of data privacy in the era of generative AI, stating, ""We believe that in this AI era, privacy becomes much more important."" He envisions a future where users can own their safe and secure hub for data processing, minimizing the risk of privacy breaches.

JollaMind² is currently in its prototype stage, with the final form factor, features, and specifications yet to be finalized. However, the device is expected to be priced below €300, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

The official announcement of Jolla's first AI product is scheduled for May 20, 2023, marking a decade since the company's initial announcement of its first mobile phone. This date symbolizes Jolla's commitment to innovation and its return to the forefront of mobile technology.

A Gap in the Social Media Landscape

In an era where social media platforms prioritize engagement and advertising, Lapse offers a refreshing alternative. It fills a void for users who crave a space where they can connect with friends without the distractions of endless feeds, notifications, and curated content.

The Future of Lapse

Buoyed by a recent $30 million funding round, Lapse is poised to expand its offerings and explore new horizons. While monetization is a potential consideration, the company remains committed to avoiding the pitfalls of traditional social media models. Instead, Lapse aims to create a sustainable business through innovative features and a focus on user experience.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/asymmetrical-financial-is-betting-big-on-the-bitcoin-defi-space-with-new-dedicated-fund/,Asymmetric Financial has a plan to unlock Bitcoin's trillion-dollar potential with dedicated DeFi fund,"

Bitcoin DeFi Venture Fund: Unveiling the Hidden Gems of the Blockchain

In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, crypto funds are honing in on specific sectors, seeking untapped opportunities and promising returns. Among them, Asymmetric Financial stands out with its Bitcoin DeFi Venture Fund I, a $21 million endeavor led by Bitcoin advocate and former Kraken executive, Dan Held.

Decentralized finance (DeFi), a revolutionary concept in the blockchain realm, leverages blockchain technology to facilitate direct transactions between market players and retail investors, eliminating the need for intermediaries. DeFi's applications span decentralized lending and borrowing platforms, enabling individuals to access capital without traditional credit checks.

Dan Held, a staunch believer in DeFi's potential within the Bitcoin ecosystem, joins forces with Asymmetric Financial's CEO and CIO, Joe McCann, to make ""contrarian bets"" in this emerging landscape. Held's extensive experience in the Bitcoin sphere, including his advisory roles in Ordinals-focused Taproot Wizards and Bitcoin application-driven Trust Machines, positions him as a visionary in this unexplored territory.

Bitcoin-Centric DeFi: A Unique Investment Opportunity

The crypto venture capital landscape often overlooks Bitcoin-centric startups, leaving a void of investment in subsectors like DeFi, layer-2 (L2) scaling networks, Ordinals, and decentralized applications (dApps). Held attributes this oversight to the misconception that Bitcoin lacks investment potential and the speculative nature of DeFi.

However, Held firmly believes that both perspectives are misguided. He foresees a surge in Bitcoin-based DeFi, driven by a new wave of talent and the commencement of a new market cycle. He identifies L2s and meta-protocols, such as NFT-like Ordinals, as areas brimming with untapped potential.

Bitcoin's Dominance and Its Alluring Ecosystem

Bitcoin's market capitalization, currently hovering around 51.2% of the total crypto market, underscores its significance and dominance. Held draws a parallel to the popularity of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, emphasizing that users flock to platforms with the largest networks. Bitcoin's extensive user base, liquidity, and value make it an attractive destination for investment and development.

The Bitcoin NFT ecosystem, though nascent, has shown remarkable growth, with daily trading volumes occasionally surpassing those of Ethereum. The recent surge in Ordinals sales further highlights the potential of Bitcoin's blockchain as an NFT platform.

Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Development

Despite the immense potential, Held acknowledges the challenges associated with building on Bitcoin. The L2 infrastructure is still in its early stages, and the developer pool is relatively smaller compared to other chains. However, Held sees this as an advantage, as L2s on Bitcoin offer greater expressivity and flexibility.

The fund's investment strategy primarily involves token deals, but equity considerations are also on the table. Beyond financial support, Held aims to leverage his expertise as a Bitcoin marketer and operator to assist projects with brand positioning, customer acquisition, and market expansion.

The Anticipated DeFi Renaissance on Bitcoin

Held envisions a ""DeFi summer"" on Bitcoin, a period of explosive growth and innovation, potentially occurring in 2025 or sooner if infrastructure development accelerates. He believes that the convergence of Bitcoin's dominance and DeFi's transformative potential will create the most significant investment opportunity in the crypto realm.

With Bitcoin's market value exceeding the combined value of all other crypto assets, Held sees the unlocking of Bitcoin's potential through DeFi as a game-changing moment in the industry's history.

In the vibrant realm of entrepreneurship, small businesses shine as beacons of innovation and economic growth. Yet, their journey to success is fraught with challenges. Understanding the reasons behind their failures can be a valuable lesson for aspiring and current business owners.

1. Underestimating the Power of Sales and Marketing:

Sales and marketing are the lifeblood of any business, regardless of its size. A common pitfall for small businesses is underestimating the significance of a robust sales and marketing strategy. For entrepreneurs who lack natural salesmanship, developing these skills or hiring experts in this field is crucial.

2. Inadequate Preparation: Setting the Stage for Success:

Inadequate preparation can cripple even the most promising business ventures. It's not just about having an idea; it's about understanding the landscape in which that idea must thrive. Comprehensive research into the industry, competitors, target audience, and financial requirements is essential. Financial preparedness is often overlooked, so entrepreneurs must assess startup and operational costs realistically and maintain a financial cushion until profitability is achieved.

3. Insufficient Effort: The Key to Unlocking Success:

The journey of a small business demands not just ideas and innovation but also sheer effort and hard work. Insufficient effort is a critical factor in their failure. It encompasses physical, mental, and emotional investment. The willingness to outwork and outlearn others is a game-changer in entrepreneurship.

4. Lack of Knowledge: Empowering Entrepreneurs with Information:

A lack of knowledge is a common reason for small business failures. Intelligence and a thirst for learning are essential entrepreneurial traits. Understanding digital marketing, online sales channels, and industry regulations can give a small business a competitive edge. Continuous learning through courses, workshops, business publications, and webinars is vital. Staying updated with industry trends, networking with professionals, and embracing technology and innovation are key to success.

Conclusion: Navigating the Road to Entrepreneurial Victory:

The path to entrepreneurial success is challenging, but with tenacity, the right mindset, and hard work, the world of financial freedom is attainable. By understanding and overcoming the common reasons for failure, entrepreneurs can set themselves up for success. Are you ready to rise to the challenge and navigate your way to business triumph?

The Final Shape: Pre-Order Puzzle or Premature Panic?

In a recent article, Destiny 2 enthusiasts have been abuzz over claims that pre-orders for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape, are alarmingly low. However, let's take a closer look at the evidence and see if these concerns hold water.

The article relies on data from Charlemagnebot, a playerbase data-hoarding tool, to track the number of players with the emblem associated with Final Shape pre-orders. The results suggest that pre-orders are significantly lower than previous expansions, Lightfall and Beyond Light.

However, there are several factors that could skew these numbers. First, the pre-order emblem is now claimed from the Rewards kiosk instead of Rahool, which may have affected the tracking accuracy. Second, pre-orders tend to surge closer to the expansion's launch date as players secure their rewards early.

Moreover, hard sales data for previous expansions is unavailable, making it difficult to compare pre-order numbers directly. The emblem data shows Beyond Light with 3.1 million pre-orders and Lightfall with 2.2 million, but Lightfall ultimately had the highest concurrent player count in Destiny's Steam history.

While it's possible that Final Shape pre-orders are lower than Bungie anticipated, it's premature to draw definitive conclusions based on the emblem data alone. Bungie's recent layoffs and the disappointing reception of Lightfall may have dampened enthusiasm for the next expansion.

However, Destiny 2 faces increasing competition in the live service market, and the game's age may also contribute to a natural decline in player base. It's important to remember that pre-order numbers are just one indicator of potential sales, and many factors can influence the final outcome.

Ultimately, while it's plausible that The Final Shape may have lower pre-orders than Bungie hoped, the evidence presented in the article is inconclusive. It's best to reserve judgment until more concrete data becomes available closer to the expansion's release.

Barbie Flip Phone: A Blast from the Past with a Modern Twist

Remember the iconic Barbie movie that took the box office by storm last summer? Well, Mattel is back with another surprise up its sleeve: the Barbie flip phone. This time, they've teamed up with European smartphone manufacturer Human Mobile Devices (HMD) to bring us a phone that's sure to make waves.

The Barbie flip phone is set to launch in the summer of 2024 and promises to embody the vintage chic of the original girl empowerment brand. Picture this: a dash of pink, a sprinkle of sparkle, and a whole lot of nostalgia.

But what truly sets this flip phone apart is its commitment to simplicity. Unlike other modern flip phones that pack in all the bells and whistles of smartphones, the Barbie flip phone goes back to basics. It's designed for those who crave a digital detox, who want to break free from the constant notifications and feeds that dominate our lives.

The target audience for this phone is clear: Gen Z. Research shows that a significant portion of Gen Zers are concerned about spending too much time on their smartphones and are actively seeking ways to limit their screen time. The Barbie flip phone taps into this desire for a simpler, more balanced life.

As a Gen Zer myself, I can totally see the appeal. There's something liberating about the idea of ditching my smartphone for a night out, leaving behind the distractions and embracing the moment with friends. The Barbie flip phone would be the perfect companion for such occasions, allowing me to stay connected without getting sucked into the digital vortex.

Of course, a smartphone is still essential for everyday life. For work, social media, and staying informed, there's no replacement. That's why I envision the Barbie flip phone as a second phone, reserved for weekends and social outings.

But here's the catch: the success of the Barbie flip phone hinges on its price point. To convince people like me, who are interested in unplugging on certain occasions, the phone needs to be affordable enough to justify purchasing a second device. Many flip phone users opt for them as secondary phones because they're typically priced below $20.

So, will I be adding the Barbie flip phone to my collection? It all comes down to the price. If it's within reach, I can definitely see myself embracing the 90s nostalgia and enjoying an unplugged summer with my Barbie flip phone in hand.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-and-elon-musk-can-set-up-windows-11-without-a-microsoft-account/,How you (and Elon Musk) can set up Windows 11 without a Microsoft account,"

In the realm of technology, even the wealthiest and most influential individuals encounter challenges. Recently, tech billionaire Elon Musk expressed his frustration with Microsoft's Windows 11 installation process, which requires users to create a Microsoft account. This requirement grants Microsoft's AI program, Copilot, access to the user's computer, a prospect that Musk found unsettling.

Musk's predicament highlights a broader issue faced by many Windows users: the lack of choice regarding Copilot's presence on their devices. While Copilot was initially optional, Microsoft integrated it into Windows 11 version 22H2, making it an unavoidable feature.

Disabling Copilot requires navigating through intricate settings or delving into the Group Policy or Registry Editor, which can be daunting for non-tech-savvy users. Moreover, even after taking these steps, Copilot's underlying functionality remains active.

Musk's solution to this dilemma was to bypass the Microsoft account requirement altogether. He suggested using a fake email address and password to create a Microsoft account, triggering a system response that prompts the user to create a local account instead. However, this workaround comes with a trade-off: the system's drive will not be automatically encrypted.

For those who prioritize data protection over potential AI surveillance, Microsoft offers an alternative: converting to a local account after signing in with a Microsoft account. This process can be initiated through the Settings menu.

For individuals who harbor deep-seated distrust towards Microsoft and its AI endeavors, a more drastic solution exists: switching to Desktop Linux. Many of Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, rely on Linux, suggesting that it could be a viable option for his personal computing needs as well.

While Linux offers a degree of freedom and control, it's essential to note that its user interface and software ecosystem differ from Windows. Adapting to Linux may require a learning curve and a willingness to explore new tools and applications.

Elon Musk's experience with Windows 11 installation underscores the challenges that users face when dealing with pre-installed software and limited customization options. Whether it's Copilot's intrusive presence or the lack of encryption without a Microsoft account, users are often left with difficult choices that impact their privacy, security, and overall computing experience.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-ramps-up-efforts-to-combat-disinformation-ahead-of-crucial-eu-elections/,Meta ramps up efforts to combat disinformation ahead of crucial EU elections,"

The upcoming European Parliament elections hold immense significance, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is taking proactive steps to combat misinformation and manipulation on its platforms.

Meta's comprehensive plan includes establishing an EU-specific Election Operations Center, expanding fact-checking partnerships, and developing tools to detect and label AI-generated content. This initiative aims to safeguard the integrity of the elections and prevent any attempts to sway voter opinions through deceptive tactics.

The stakes are high, as the June elections will shape the future of the European Union. Voter manipulation, especially with advanced technologies like deepfakes, poses a serious threat to the democratic process. Meta's efforts are crucial in ensuring that voters receive accurate information and make informed decisions.

However, experts caution that Meta's plan may have limitations. Recent reports indicate the company's failure to detect coordinated influence campaigns from China targeting Americans in the 2022 midterms. Critics argue that the expansion of fact-checking to all 24 official EU languages and the requirement for AI-generated content disclosures lack sufficient rigor.

The absence of a reliable system to authenticate images and videos showcasing violent confrontations remains a concern. Advanced editing software makes it challenging to debunk compelling fake footage. Additionally, the addition of only three more fact-checking partners seems inadequate given the scale of the misinformation threat.

Meta's transparency labels for AI content are a positive step, but experts question the system's ability to accurately identify manipulated media like deepfakes. Currently, no technology can detect AI forgeries with complete accuracy.

Past influence operations have exploited authentic voices, such as politicians and journalists, to amplify divisive narratives. Even small-scale disinformation attempts can gain traction if amplified by public figures. Meta's global threat intelligence lead, Ben Nimmo, emphasizes the role of reputable influencers in covert campaigns' success.

With the EU elections approaching, Meta remains vigilant. However, as deepfake technology advances, the frontlines of information warfare become increasingly complex. Meta's plan is a step in the right direction, but protecting democracy in the social media era remains a daunting challenge. Authentic voices with power and influence will continue to be prime targets for manipulation.
