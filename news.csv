Midas, a trailblazing fintech startup based in Turkey, recently secured $45 million in a Series B financing round headed by Portage of Canada. This innovative firm enables individuals in Turkey to dabble in both U.S. and Turkish equity markets while charging reduced transaction and commission fees. With over 2 million users, Midas continues to grow and attract attention from international investors. In this article, we delve deeper into the story behind Midas' triumph and explore their future aspirations.

[THE EMERGING TURKISH RETAIL INVESTOR MARKET]

Historically, Turkey hasn't seen high levels of participation in capital markets; however, things began changing around three years ago when Midas entered the scene. At that time, the number of investors stood at just 1.5 million amidst a population of 80 million. Today, thanks largely to companies like Midas, mobile banking is thriving in Turkey, though equities investments still required improvement due to insufficient infrastructure—a gap Midas eagerly filled.

Egem Eraslan, CEO and founder of Midas, explained how they successfully altered the status quo through strategic development of infrastructure and delivery of outstanding user experiences. ""Our efficient use of resources enabled us to build crucial infrastructure, secure licenses, gain traction, and eventually scale up despite limited initial capital.""

[DIFFERENTIATION AND GROWTH]

While comparisons can be drawn between Midas and U.S.-based Robinhood, Eraslan emphasized the unique challenges faced in Turkey. To succeed, Midas needed to develop its own custodial, clearing, and execution systems along with various other offerings across the entire value chain. By doing so, they provided Turks with an accessible pathway towards participating in global financial markets.

Now, armed with fresh funding, Midas prepares to introduce three novel services – crypto trading, mutual funds, and savings accounts. Additionally, Midas looks forward to expanding beyond Turkey and setting sights on countries within the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region. These ambitious moves aim to solidify Midas' position as a regional leader in financial technologies.

[SUCCESSFUL FUNDING ROUNDS AND STRONG BACKING]

This recent $45 million influx marks yet another successful milestone for Midas, following their impressive $11 million seed round back in 2022. Among those contributing to the most recent round are International Finance Corporation, Spark Capital, Earlybird Digital East Fund, and Revo Capital. Cem Sertoglu, Managing Partner of Earlybird Digital East Fund, praised Midas' performance thus far, stating, ""Winning the domestic market in the world's 11th-largest economy will already be a success for Midas, but its ambitions lie further than that.""

Paul Desmarais III, Co-Founder of Portage and CEO and Chairman of Sagard, shared similar sentiments about Midas being a catalyst for positive changes in Turkey's financial sector and potentially driving such advancements worldwide, particularly throughout regions known for rapid adoption of financial innovations.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MAPP-W.jpg?w=750,2024-04-19 17:04:30,"Invest in Turkey's equities with reduced fees: Midas raises $45M, eyes MENA expansion.

A groundbreaking study led by the University of Michigan reveals that climate change will significantly enhance the future worth of residential rooftop solar panels in the United States by up to 19% by the end of this century. This increase in value stems from heightened electricity bill savings and revenue from surplus electricity sold to the grid, minus the initial installation expenses. With the typical 25-year lifespan of a rooftop solar setup, these installations will predominantly encounter weather patterns characteristic of 2050 and beyond. Consequently, incorporating future climate considerations into present decision-making processes can yield enhanced long-term rewards for homeowners investing in solar energy.

The research team, comprising experts from various institutions, calculated the value of solar (VOS) – essentially, the financial advantages derived from electricity bill reductions and additional income from excess power fed into the grid after accounting for initial investment outlays. Under a moderate climate-warming scenario known as Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-4.5, numerous American households stand to gain substantial annual sums by the century's end due to the escalated value of residential rooftop solar installations. These projected profits primarily result from amplified residential air-conditioning needs prompted by global warming and fluctuations in solar panel productivity influenced by changing atmospheric conditions.

Study lead author Mai Shi emphasized that this investigation constitutes the maiden attempt to quantify the impact of climate change on the value of rooftop solar installations in the United States. The results demonstrate that households nationwide will enjoy superior cost savings under future climate scenarios compared to historical ones. Specifically, southern regions characterized by hotter climes exhibit significant potential for harnessing augmented economic benefits from adopting rooftop solar setups. However, some northern localities may witness diminishing returns owing to deteriorating solar panel efficiencies amidst intensifying heatwaves.

Air-conditioning requirements represent a crucial determinant driving the surge in rooftop solar panel valuation. As temperatures climb, the share of solar-generated electricity utilized for domestic cooling purposes increases, thereby reducing exports to the electrical grid. In most jurisdictions, self-consumption of solar power offsets household electricity bills entirely, whereas power sales to the grid typically earn lower credits. Thus, higher cooling loads incentivize solar users to maximize onsite consumption, ultimately boosting personal profit margins. Furthermore, the analysis projects a mean 35% uptick in summertime cooling necessities by mid-century and approximately 64% by 2100, transcending geographical boundaries.

Another essential aspect shaping the future value of residential rooftop photovoltaics involves solar panel productivity in tandem with rising temperatures and shifting cloud cover patterns. Ideal solar panel functionality occurs in temperate, radiant settings; however, elevated air temperatures or overcast skies adversely affect electricity generation. Accordingly, the study predicts varying levels of solar panel performance across distinct US regions throughout the ensuing decades. Areas like Ann Arbor, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Louisville, and Milwaukee may grapple with decreased panel efficiency resulting from climbing mercury levels despite improved irradiation stemming from attenuated cloud cover. Nonetheless, these contrasting trends appear poised to counterbalance one another, implying minimal net consequences for affected residents.

In summary, mounting evidence underscores the burgeoning significance of integrating climate resilience measures into renewable energy infrastructure development strategies. By acknowledging forthcoming shifts in environmental parameters, stakeholders can optimize resource allocation frameworks and ensure longevity in sustainability initiatives. Ultimately, informed decisions anchored in robust scientific assessments promise sizeable dividends for individuals and communities embracing solar technologies during these transformative times.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/climate-change-will-in.jpg,2024-04-19 05:00:01,"Meta Description: Discover how climate change can boost the value of residential solar panels by up to 19% by 2100, with increased electricity bill savings and revenue from surplus power.

Introduction

Staying current with the ever-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) industry can be challenging. This roundup delves into recent AI stories, notable research, and experiments, focusing on Meta's Llama 3 models and the ongoing debate about open source practices in the AI community.

Meta's Llama 3: Open Source or Not?

Meta recently introduced Llama 3 8B and 70B, the latest additions to their Llama series of generative AI models. These models, capable of analyzing and generating text, are intended to be a ""foundational piece"" for developers' unique systems. However, despite Meta's claims of open sourcing, there are licensing restrictions that prevent unrestricted use of the models.

The term ""open source"" is subject to interpretation, and the debate over its definition is far from new. A study by Carnegie Mellon, AI Now Institute, and Signal Foundation highlights the limitations of many AI models marketed as open source, including restricted access to training data, high computational requirements, and expensive labor for fine-tuning.

Defining open source within the context of AI is complex, especially with copyright's applicability to model components and scaffolding. It is essential to distinguish the perception of open source from the practical aspects of AI development, as open source was initially designed to allow developers to study and modify code without restrictions.

The Impact of Tech Giants' ""Open Source"" AI Projects

Tech giants, like Meta, leveraging the open source label often create news cycles and provide strategic benefits to the projects' maintainers. However, the open-source community rarely sees these advantages. Instead, such projects tend to centralize and expand power, rather than democratizing AI.

Title: Solar Innovation Breaks Record in Green Ammonia Production","Title: Revolutionary Solar-driven Ammonia Production Breaks New Records

In a groundbreaking achievement, researchers from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), along with collaborators from Stanford University, have developed a revolutionary technology harnessing solar power to produce ammonia (NH3) with unprecedented efficiency. This innovative approach not only provides an eco-friendly alternative to traditional methods but also sets a new world record in ammonia production efficiency.

The current industrial practice for generating ammonia is through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, which consumes vast amounts of fossil fuels and produces greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the novel technique devised by the UNIST team utilizes a perovskite-based photoelectrode system powered solely by sunlight. This system efficiently reduces nitrate (NO3-) found in wastewater to generate ammonia—a critical component in numerous sectors including agriculture, food preservation, and pharmaceuticals.

An essential aspect contributing to the exceptional efficacy of this technology is the creation of a highly efficient photoelectrode combining perovskite solar cells with a ruthenium (Ru) catalyst layered onto titanate nanosheets (TiNS). Encapsulating the delicate perovskite structure with Field's metal enhances its resilience while seamlessly interfacing it with the catalyst facilitates superior NH3 production rates and robustness.

One notable feature of this breakthrough is the integration of glycerol – a low-cost byproduct stemming from biomass conversion – as both a solvent and a reactant during the ammonia generation process. Through meticulous optimization of the oxidation reactions involving glycerol, driven by the self-generated voltage from the photoelectrodes, the team successfully attained an outstanding maximum ammonia yield of 1745 μgNH3 cm−2 h−1. Impressively, this figure transcends the commercialization benchmark established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) by a factor of 1.7, solidifying it as a new global standard.

Aside from producing ammonia, this cutting-edge method concurrently eliminates harmful nitrates from polluted waters and transforms undervalued glycerol residue into worthwhile glyceric acid (GA). Consequently, this technology promises substantial benefits for the renewable fuel sector and bolsters sustainability efforts across multiple frontiers.

According to Professor Ji-Wook Jang, one of the lead investigators from UNIST, ""this study exemplifies the successful marriage of waste remediation and value-added chemical synthesis under solar illumination."" He further added, ""the resulting products hold considerable significance for environmentally responsible fuel production."" Meanwhile, his colleague, Professor Sung-Yeon Jang, expressed enthusiasm about their findings, stating, ""our research signifies monumental progress towards commercially viable solar fuel technologies, ultimately fostering a greener and more sustainable pathway for large-scale ammonia manufacture.""

Indeed, this pioneering discovery marks a significant leap forward in realizing practical applications for solar fuel production and ushers in exciting prospects for tomorrow's cleaner, more sustainable industrial landscape.

Title: Solar Innovation Breaks Record in Green Ammonia Production","Title: Inferring Human Behavior: Unlocking Collaboration Between Humans and AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, yet creating AI systems that cooperate seamlessly with humans remains a challenge. To address this issue, understanding human behavior is crucial. However, humans are far from rational actors; our choices are often influenced by computational limitations. Researchers from MIT and the University of Washington introduce a novel approach to model such bounded rationality in agents, whether human or artificial. This innovative method can deduce an agent's computational constraints based on their past actions, enabling accurate predictions of future behavior.

An Agent's 'Inference Budget': Understanding Constraints

Traditional models attempting to represent suboptimal decision-making typically add randomness to the system. These methods, however, fall short in capturing the nuances of human behavior as people don't consistently make mistakes in identical patterns. Moreover, accounting for individual differences in cognitive processing power and biases is essential for accurately depicting human behavior.

MIT and UW researchers recognized these challenges and turned their attention towards examining chess players' thought processes during games. By observing how players spent varying amounts of time contemplating different moves, they identified a correlation between planning depth and an agent's ability level. Stronger players generally devoted more time to complex problems compared to simpler situations. Building upon this insight, the team designed a framework capable of estimating an agent's planning depth based on observed actions.

Here's how the model works:

1. An algorithm is employed to tackle the given problem for a fixed duration.
2. Decisions reached by the algorithm throughout the resolution process are recorded.
3. The model analyzes the agent's historical actions and matches them against the algorithmic solutions.
4. Once aligned, the point at which the agent ceased planning is pinpointed.
5. Based on this analysis, the model calculates the agent's inference budget—the span dedicated to problem-solving.
6. Utilizing the inference budget, the model forecasts how the agent would react in similar scenarios.

Applications Beyond Chess

Although demonstrated through chess examples, the application potential extends beyond gaming environments. Imagine an AI personal shopping assistant. With a solid grasp of your browsing history, preferences, and typical response times, the tool could estimate your likelihood of purchasing particular items. Anticipating decision delays caused by distractions or second thoughts, it offers tailored suggestions accordingly, optimizing user experience.

Additionally, consider a smart home device learning to accommodate family members' unique habits. Recognizing Grandma struggles with technology, her grandson teaches her to ask Alexa for reminders. Over time, the system identifies slower input rates and adjusts prompt presentation, allowing sufficient reaction time without overwhelming Grandma. Meanwhile, Dad receives quick prompts since he responds swiftly. Individualized interaction enhances accessibility across generations.

Improving AI Cooperation

By integrating these insights, AI developers pave the way for smarter, more intuitive tools fostering collaboration between humans and machines. Predictive algorithms like those described above empower AI systems to anticipate user needs proactively. As AI learns to recognize subtle cues indicative of deliberation, hesitation, or disinterest, it adapts communication styles, fine-tunes recommendations, and ultimately strengthens partnerships.

Athul Paul Jacob, an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science graduate student, emphasizes the importance of such progress: ""Understanding human behavior allows us to create AI systems capable of offering assistance precisely when needed... By identifying possible missteps and responding appropriately, AI partners become truly helpful resources.""

Introduction

Vector databases are rapidly gaining popularity, fueled by the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) and the generative AI (GenAI) movement. These databases offer an efficient solution for handling unstructured data, such as images, videos, emails, and social media posts, which do not fit neatly into traditional relational databases like Postgres or MySQL. This article explores the growing significance of vector databases, their unique advantages, and the startups leading the charge in this exciting new space.

Understanding Vector Databases

Unlike traditional relational databases, vector databases store and process data in the form of vector embeddings. These embeddings convert text, documents, images, and other data into numerical representations, capturing the meaning and relationships between data points. This approach is particularly beneficial for machine learning applications, as the database organizes data spatially based on relevance, making it easier to retrieve semantically similar data.

Vector databases are especially useful for LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, by allowing AI chatbots to better understand conversation context through analyzing previous similar conversations. Additionally, vector search is valuable for real-time applications, such as content recommendations in social networks or e-commerce apps, as it can quickly retrieve similar items based on user search history. Vector search can also help reduce ""hallucinations"" in LLM applications by providing additional information not available in the original training dataset.

The Growing Vector Database Landscape

Several vector database startups have recently secured significant funding, including Qdrant, Vespa, Weaviate, Pinecone, and Chroma, which collectively raised $200 million in 2022. Moreover, the beginning of 2023 has seen investments in Superlinked, a platform that transforms complex data into vector embeddings, and Lantern, a startup offering a hosted vector search engine for Postgres.

One such startup, Marqo, raised a $4.4 million seed round in late 2022, followed by a $12.5 million Series A round in February 2023. Marqo's platform provides vector generation, storage, and retrieval tools, enabling users to bypass third-party","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1352233059-e1713440884982.jpg?resize=1200,676",2024-04-20 15:00:45,"Discover the power of vector databases in managing unstructured data.
