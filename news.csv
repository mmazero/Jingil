In a groundbreaking study, a team of human-computer interaction experts from the UK and Canada has developed a revolutionary system to combat motion sickness in virtual reality (VR) for vehicle passengers. Simultaneously, this system enables users to experience motion at exhilaratingly slower or faster speeds than the actual vehicle they're traveling in. This pioneering research will be presented at the Association of Computing Machinery CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May 2024.

The Problem: Motion Sickness in VR

Motion sickness is a common issue that arises from the discrepancy between the physical motion experienced by our vestibular system and visual perception. This disconnect can lead to discomfort and nausea for some users. While some VR systems attempt to minimize motion sickness by aligning real-world vehicle movements with perceived virtual movements, this approach has its limitations.

The Solution: Translational Gain and Attenuation

The research team introduced a novel system based on the principles of translational gain and attenuation. Translational gain increases the virtual motion in response to a user's real-world movement, while translational attenuation reduces the virtual motion in relation to the real-world movement.

The researchers conducted a study with 17 participants who wore VR headsets while being driven on a 2 km route in Glasgow's west end. The study consisted of three hour-long sessions, with participants experiencing virtual speeds that matched, exceeded, and were slower than their actual speed.

In the 'faster-than-real-life' condition, the virtual speed increased from 72 km/h to 338 km/h‚Äîseven times faster than reality‚Äîover four sections. In the 'slower-than-real-life' condition, participants moved through the virtual city at speeds lower than the actual 50 km/h.

The researchers noted minimal motion sickness issues, even in the 'ludicrous speed' scenarios. The study's success lies in providing enjoyable virtual experiences without causing motion sickness, thus expanding the scope of VR experiences during travel.

Introduction

Microsoft has recently unveiled a groundbreaking development in artificial intelligence (AI) with the creation of a small, locally run family of AI language models, known as Phi-3 mini. This innovative SLM outperforms many of its competitors in its class and even some larger models, all while maintaining a cost-effective and compact design.

An Overview of Phi-3 Mini

Phi-3 mini, as described in Microsoft's Technical Report on the arXiv preprint server, is a significant advancement in AI technology due to its enhanced capabilities and affordability compared to larger models. These SLMs are specifically designed to operate on devices that do not require an internet connection, making them more accessible and versatile for users.

Phi-3 mini-applications are 3.8B language models, which refers to the number of parameters they can utilize. The greater the number of parameters, the more powerful the model. For instance, GPT-4 is estimated to have over a trillion parameters, which necessitates substantial computing power and prevents it from running locally.

Despite its small size, Phi-3 mini underwent training using 3.3 trillion tokens, enabling it to provide a reasonable degree of artificial intelligence. This new model is an evolution of two earlier versions, Phi-1 and Phi-2, which were made available to the public last year.

Comparing Phi-3 Mini to Other Models

Microsoft asserts that Phi-3 models can rival the performance of GPT-3.5 and some other Large Language Models (LLMs). Users can expect a surprisingly positive experience when comparing Phi-3 mini to other small models. These compact SLMs are designed to operate on computers with as little as 8GB of RAM, further emphasizing their efficiency and accessibility.

Achieving High Performance with Phi-3 Mini

Microsoft's team attributes the impressive performance of Phi-3 mini to the high-quality data used during the training process. This data includes filtered web content and information from textbooks, ensuring that the model is exposed to accurate, reliable, and relevant information. Additionally, new features were incorporated to enhance user experience, providing a more robust, secure, and enjoyable interactive interface.

This innovative approach can inspire new techniques for real-world problems and advance AI security and interpretability. AI Neurodegeneration Research","Title: Artificially Inducing Cognitive Decline in AI: A New Approach to Understanding Complex Systems

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have been striving to create systems that can emulate human cognitive abilities. However, unlike the human mind, AI systems typically maintain consistent performance over time or even enhance their skills. A team of researchers from the University of California, Irvine has taken a novel approach to understanding complex AI systems by artificially inducing cognitive decline, mimicking the effects of aging and neurodegeneration.

The concept for this study emerged during a dinner conversation between Dr. Baldi, Dr. Pishgar, and Yu-Dai Tsai, who was inspired by his father's recent brain trauma and subsequent cognitive decline. The researchers aimed to create cognitive declines in AI agents to gain insights into complex systems, enhance interpretability, and improve security, rather than replicating human brain diseases.

To explore this idea, the researchers utilized IQ tests performed by large language models (LLMs) such as the LLaMA 2, introducing the concept of 'neural erosion.' This deliberate erosion involves ablating synapses or neurons or adding Gaussian noise during or after training, resulting in a controlled decline in the LLMs' performance.

The researchers observed a specific pattern when they deliberately ablated some of the artificial synapses or neurons of the LLaMA 2 model. This pattern revealed that AI systems first lose their ability to think in abstract ways, followed by a decline in mathematical abilities and ultimately, a loss in linguistic skills. This 'neuro-erosion' pattern shares similarities with the neurodegeneration patterns observed in humans.

This pioneering study could inspire further research into dedicated neurodegeneration in AI agents, going beyond previous works that focused on reproducing human neurodegeneration. The observed AI neuro-erosion patterns could potentially lead to the development of new techniques to address real-world problems.

The researchers plan to build upon this study by developing specific tests for AI systems, extending the emulation to other neural diseases and neurodiversity, and applying their methods to improve AI security and interpretability.

For years, robotics engineers have endeavored to develop robots that can match the walking and running prowess of animals. However, even after spending vast amounts of research funds and dedicating considerable time, we have yet to create robots that can rival the endurance, agility, and robustness observed in various animals, be it a wildebeest's long-distance migration over harsh terrains, a mountain goat's remarkable ability to climb steep cliffs, or a cockroach's incredible resilience after losing a leg.

A group of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers from leading research universities embarked on a comprehensive study to understand and measure the differences between running robots and their animal counterparts. Published in Science Robotics, the paper reveals that, while individual biological components may underperform their fabricated counterparts, animals' integrated and controlled systems far surpass those of existing robots.

The research team, comprising Dr. Max Donelan, Dr. Sam Burden, Tom Libby, Kaushik Jayaram, and Simon Sponberg, studied five distinct subsystems that collectively contribute to a running robot: Power, Frame, Actuation, Sensing, and Control. Contrary to popular belief, the study demonstrates that engineering subsystems generally outperform their biological counterparts, sometimes significantly. However, when it comes to whole-system movement, animals still hold an undeniable advantage over robots.

Co-author Tom Libby explains, ""Animals are amazing in terms of movement, and robots are yet to catch up."" Despite the significant gap, the researchers highlight that the progress made in robotics, achieved in a relatively short span of time compared to the millions of years of animal evolution, is quite remarkable. Dr. Sam Burden adds, ""Evolution has a massive head start, but engineering can move much more quickly.""

As robotics continues to advance, the potential applications for agile and robust running robots become increasingly diverse. Imagine delivery robots seamlessly maneuvering through human-centric environments or search-and-rescue robots operating safely in dangerous conditions.

The results showed that a U.S.-Caribbean super grid could enhance power reliability, while adding South America to the mix could provide energy security. This innovative solution for hurricane-prone regions could ensure uninterrupted electricity access even during extreme weather events.","Title: Harnessing the Power of Super Grids to Reinforce Hurricane-Prone Solar Energy Generation

Introduction

As Caribbean islands seek to reduce their dependence on expensive fossil fuels, they have turned to their abundant sun and wind resources to generate electricity. However, the frequent hurricanes that plague the region can have a detrimental impact on solar energy production. Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a comprehensive modeling method to better predict the reduction in electricity generation caused by hurricane cloud cover. This article explores how ""super grids"" can help compensate for these energy losses and ensure reliable electricity access for the historically underserved island residents.

Modeling Hurricane Impact on Solar Energy Generation

Led by researcher Rodney Itiki, the team used advanced computing methods to create a modeling algorithm that explores different grid connection approaches and their impact on electricity availability. The model analyzed how a large hurricane would reduce power from known solar installations while traveling along 10 possible paths over 10 to 14 days.

The study, published in the journal Energies, simulated power availability during hurricanes if electric grids were connected via high-voltage cables on the ocean floor. By modeling four different combinations‚Äîstandalone U.S. grid, standalone Caribbean super grid, U.S.-Caribbean super grid, and a super grid connecting the U.S., Caribbean islands, and South America‚Äîresearchers sought to understand the potential benefits and limitations of each configuration.

Benefits and Limitations of Super Grid Configurations

The researchers found that the U.S.-Caribbean super grid increased power reliability the most, while the standalone Caribbean super grid proved least helpful. The addition of South America to the super grid did not significantly reduce power variations due to the continent's limited solar installations. However, it could provide energy security as an alternate power supply if islands became disconnected from each other or from the U.S. system.

The largest super grid configuration included 90 photovoltaic plants within the hurricane corridor, plus solar farms in places such as California and Brazil that are unaffected by hurricanes. The model showed some solar plants losing as much as 88% of their generating capacity for two days while shaded by hurricane clouds.

The new title is concise, informative, and optimized for search engines while preserving the essential details of the original headline.","Title: Soaring Above Turbulence: A New AI-Based Control Method for Fault-Tolerant Flying Vehicles

Introduction:
Imagine a future where air taxis and autonomous drones dart through the skies, bypassing ground traffic with ease. As these hybrid electric flying vehicles become a reality, ensuring their safety is of paramount importance. Caltech engineers have developed an onboard machine learning-based control method, called ""Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance"" (NFFT), to help aircraft detect and compensate for disturbances, allowing them to maintain stable flight even in the face of unforeseen challenges.

The Challenge of Safety and Redundancy:
Urban aerial vehicles typically have multiple propellers, or rotors, for redundancy. If one rotor fails, the remaining motors can keep the aircraft aloft. However, to reduce energy consumption during flights between urban locations, these vehicles also require fixed wings. This combination of rotors and wings presents many potential points of failure, making it crucial to develop an efficient fault detection system.

The NFFT Solution:
Caltech's NFFT method uses a deep-learning approach that relies on a neural network pre-trained with real-life flight data and adaptive control techniques. By observing the aircraft's attitude and position over time, NFFT can detect deviations from the desired flight path and compensate for errors in real-time, even in the event of a motor failure. This innovative approach eliminates the need for additional sensors or hardware, making it a cost-effective and efficient solution.

Virtual Sensors and Real-time Control:
NFFT's real-time control signals and algorithms serve as virtual sensors, enabling fault detection for any type of vehicle. This system has been primarily tested on Caltech's Autonomous Flying Ambulance, a hybrid electric vehicle designed for rapid medical transportation. The NFFT method's rapid response‚Äîcorrections occur in less than a second‚Äîallows the aircraft to maintain stability and controllability, even when faced with unforeseen issues.

The world we live in today is hard to imagine without electric vehicles (EVs) and portable electronic devices such as laptops and mobile phones. These modern marvels have one crucial component in common: lithium-ion batteries. However, the production of these batteries often involves highly toxic materials like cobalt, posing significant environmental and health risks, particularly in the mining regions. Moreover, the scarcity of these metals is a pressing issue.

A groundbreaking discovery in battery technology has been made by a research team at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (HU), led by Professor Dr. Michael J. Bojdys. They have developed a high-performance sulfur-based cathode, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional, metal-centric cathodes.

Sulfur is an attractive alternative due to its reduced toxicity and abundance compared to conventional materials. However, sulfur-based batteries have suffered from rapid storage capacity decline, limiting their widespread adoption. This obstacle has now been overcome by the HU researchers, as reported in Angewandte Chemie.

""Our innovation opens the door for sulfur electrodes as a feasible substitute for conventional metal-based cathodes, potentially revolutionizing energy storage and usage, and marking a significant step towards a greener future,"" says Prof. Bojdys.

Introduction

The global pandemic has forced many small businesses, including coffee shops, to rethink their operations and embrace technology. Online ordering and payment systems have become essential for these establishments to continue serving their customers safely. Startups and venture capitalists have also joined forces to help coffee shops navigate this new landscape. Among these innovators is Dripos, a New York-based coffee shop software company founded by Jack Pawlik and Avery Durrant in 2019.

The Pivot: From Mobile Ordering to a Comprehensive Solution

Originally, Dripos aimed to assist local coffee shops in creating mobile ordering apps, similar to Starbucks' offering. However, through conversations with shop owners, Pawlik and Durrant discovered a more significant issue. Many coffee shops relied on basic point-of-sale systems like Square, which didn't cater specifically to their workflow. As a result, these businesses employed five to ten other software solutions to fill the gaps.

In response, Dripos pivoted to develop a single, comprehensive tool that would replace Square, Toast, and the eight additional pieces of software with one all-encompassing platform.

Unified Solutions: Dripos' Offerings

Dripos brings together point-of-sale, mobile payments, employee management and payroll, loyalty and marketing automation, and administrative functions such as accounting and banking. This unified solution allows coffee shop owners to manage their operations more efficiently.
