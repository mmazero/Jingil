ShareChat's Valuation Drops Below $2 Billion

ShareChat, a social media startup based in India, has seen a significant drop in its valuation. The company, which boasts over 400 million users in the South Asian market, recently raised $49 million in a convertible round, bringing its total funding to about $1.75 billion. However, sources claim that the valuation at which the funds were raised is below $2 billion, despite the company strongly denying it.

The decline in valuation comes despite ShareChat experiencing remarkable growth over the past year. The company has aggressively cut expenses while managing to double its revenue. ShareChat has not spent money acquiring users in the past year, with its content recommendation engine driving user retention and engagement. The company has also invested heavily in AI talent, particularly for senior roles in its London-based team.

ShareChat has also been able to pare down its single-largest expense, the cost of serving content. The company has reduced its monthly cash burn by 90% over the past two years while doubling revenue, attracting large FMCG firms and gaming companies as advertisers.

Despite strong competition from YouTube and Instagram following the country's ban on TikTok in 2020, ShareChat remains committed to the short-video market in India. The company's unique focus on live-streaming as a destination for entertainment and creator-user connections differentiates it from American rivals.

The decline in valuation is a significant setback for ShareChat, which has been a leader in the Indian social media market. However, the company's strong growth and continued focus on innovation suggest that it will bounce back in the future.

Introduction

Data has become the lifeblood of artificial intelligence (AI) development, driving advancements in machine learning algorithms and shaping our increasingly connected world. However, as data becomes more valuable, questions about ownership, privacy, and compensation arise. Enter Vana, a pioneering startup dedicated to empowering individuals to take charge of their data, fostering transparency, and ensuring fairness in the era of AI. In addition, Vana recently introduced the groundbreaking Reddit Data Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling users to collaboratively manage their Reddit data and potentially benefit financially from its usage. This article explores Vana's mission, platform, and the innovative Reddit Data DAO.

Vana's Mission and Platform

Founded in 2021 by Anna Kazlauskas and Art Abal, both alumni of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Vana aims to revolutionize the relationship between individuals and their data through a unique platform. By aggregating personal data such as chats, speech recordings, and photographs in a non-custodial manner, users can form datasets tailored for generative AI model training. Additionally, Vana enables developers to create customized user experiences—such as daily motivational messages aligned with health objectives or artistic creations reflecting preferred styles—by fine-tuning public models on individual datasets.

As stated by Kazlauskas, ""Vana's infrastructure essentially establishes a user-owned data treasury...allowing users to own AI models and utilize their data across various AI applications."" Through the Vana API, developers seamlessly integrate a user's cross-platform personal data, offering enhanced onboarding processes and removing computational cost barriers. Furthermore, users retain control over where their data resides, whether on Vana's servers or via self-hosted solutions, ensuring peace of mind regarding security and privacy.

Addressing Concerns and Misconceptions

Understandably, some may wonder why anyone would willingly share personal information with an unknown startup, especially given heightened concerns around data privacy and breaches. To address these fears, Kazlauskas emphasizes that Vana's primary objective is to help users regain control over their data, providing options to host data independently instead of storing it on Vana's servers and granting users autonomy over sharing choices. Moreover, since Vana generates revenue primarily through user subscriptions ($3.99 per month) and data transaction fees, there is no incentive to manipulate or exploit users and their associated data assets.

Introducing the Reddit Data DAO

Expanding upon its commitment to democratizing data, Vana recently unveiled the revolutionary Reddit Data DAO. As part of this initiative, participants combine their Reddit data—including karma scores and posting histories—into a single collective dataset managed jointly by participating members. Upon registering with a Reddit account, submitting a data request, and contributing their Reddit data to the DAO, users earn voting rights alongside fellow contributors. These votes determine crucial matters related to the shared data, such as licensing terms governing use by generative AI businesses and potential financial returns derived from these partnerships. With over 141,000 Reddit users and approximately 21,000 complete data uploads during phase one alone, the Reddit Data DAO already ranks as the most extensive data DAO to date.

Conclusion

In summary, Vana offers a transformative approach to managing personal data, prioritizing user control, privacy, and equitable compensation. By leveraging advanced technologies like blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations, Vana empowers individuals to participate actively in the burgeoning AI landscape, opening doors to novel opportunities and promoting ethical practices in data management.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/reddit-ipo-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-13 16:15:41,"Rent out Reddit data with Vana's new DAO - Regain control, ensure fairness!

Curious Curbsides & Robotic Factories

New Delhi-based heavyweight Ola abandoned business activities across Britain, Australia, and New Zealand while shifting focus toward domestic markets. Parallelly, an interesting NY-based start-up named Swiftmile endeavors to introduce curbside EV charging infrastructure utilizing streetlights. Meanwhile, Uber Eats debuted a short-video function reminiscent of TikTok, aiming to bolster user engagement. Furthermore, Canadian manufacturing titan Magna commenced trials leveraging humanoid robots conceived by Sanctuary AI inside production facilities.

Moreover, don't forget about the escalating tussles surrounding e-scooters in urban landscapes and the intriguing potential of drones expediting medical deliveries in remote regions.

Insights on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)

Recent weeks witnessed two regrettable accidents implicating Ford's BlueCruise ADAS functionality. Both cases prompted official probes by America's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). One unfortunate incident transpired in Texas, culminating in a single fatality after a Mustang Mach-E smashed into a motionless vehicle while employing the BlueCruise mode. Notably, this tragedy marks the initial recorded demise associated with a collision involving BlueCruise. The subsequent accident occurred near Philadelphia, leading to yet another ongoing investigation by the NTSB.

Self-Driving Showdown

Despite temporarily halting its operations earlier this year, Cruise—General Motor's autonomous division—is making waves once again. Specifically, they recommenced deployments in Arizona's sunny metropolis, Phoenix. However, contrary to expectations, these journeys involve humans controlling the wheel rather than trusty algorithms. Interestingly enough, even though Cruise boasts historical experience navigating Phoenix roads, the company still intends on collecting additional geographical data throughout the region. Could this be indicative of lingering skepticism pertaining to the robustness of their autonomous prowess? Only time will reveal the truth behind this puzzling maneuver.

Conversely, competitor Waymo proudly rolled out its commercial robotaxi service in Los Angeles following approvals granted by state authorities. Although initially limited in scope, expansion efforts hinge on burgeoning consumer demands and encouraging operational statistics.

Green Light vs. Affordability: An Electrifying Debate

While environmental consciousness warrants celebration, pragmatic considerations cannot be overlooked. Recent reports suggest that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's preference for investing heavily in research and development related to robotaxis over reasonably priced EV models could put the brand's competitive edge at risk. Striking an optimal equilibrium between ecological responsibility and financial viability emerges vital for fostering global EV adoption rates.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/13/government-spyware-use-ad-blocker/,Government spyware is another reason to use an ad blocker,"Title: Safeguard Privacy with Ad Blockers: They Now Counteract Government Spyware

Summary: Use ad blockers to protect against sophisticated cyber threats, including government spyware using online ads for surveillance.","Title: Protect Your Privacy: Why Using an Ad Blocker Can Shield You From Government Spyware

In today's digital age, maintaining our privacy is becoming increasingly challenging due to sophisticated cyber threats, including those coming from government agencies. One unexpected yet powerful tool you can utilize to safeguard your devices from these risks is an ad blocker. While traditionally employed to improve user experience by hiding unwanted ads, recent developments highlight its role in protecting us from potential surveillance.

A report by Israeli news outlet Haaretz sheds light on how companies specializing in spyware have started exploiting online ads to enable governments to carry out espionage activities. These firms allegedly employ targeted advertisements to discreetly install spyware onto specific devices belonging to chosen individuals—without requiring them to click any links. This innovative technique effectively expands the reach of government clients seeking to monitor people, even their own citizens or critics.

Intellexa, a European firm responsible for creating Predator spyware, showcased a concept named Aladdin in 2022 during a demonstration. According to reports, this system allowed for the surreptitious installation of mobile phone spyware via online ads. Although details regarding its development and sale remain uncertain, the implication is alarming enough: hackers could potentially gain complete control over someone's smartphone without requiring any form of engagement from the target.

Another Israeli company, Insanet, managed to create an ad-based infection mechanism that identifies and pinpoints targets within an ad network. With online advertising being so pervasive across the internet, it significantly widens the scope of possible victims whom government entities may wish to surveil.

The risk posed by malicious ads (malvertising) extends beyond mere annoyance; attackers inject harmful code into seemingly innocent ads appearing on various websites. Often, such attacks necessitate some degree of interaction from the unsuspecting user, such as clicking a deceptive link or downloading disguised files. However, given the sheer prevalence of online ads, the probability of encountering malvertising grows exponentially, making every user vulnerable.

So why consider adding an ad blocker to your security arsenal? An ad blocker functions not only to conceal intrusive ads but also prevents the associated websites from delivering these potentially dangerous payloads to your device. By blocking the source altogether, ad-blocking tools preserve both your browsing experience and personal data integrity. It's worth noting that most reputable ad-blocking solutions offer compatibility with popular desktop and mobile platforms, rendering protection accessible regardless of your preferred device.

Cybersecurity professionals consistently recommend implementing ad blockers as part of a comprehensive approach towards safer browsing habits. As early as 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a public service announcement advocating the usage of ad blockers for enhanced online safety measures. Cybersecurity researchers like John Scott-Railton echo similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of incorporating ad blockers into daily routines. After all, when dealing with elusive threats lurking behind innocuous-looking advertisements, it pays to stay vigilant and proactive about securing your digital world.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/data-flowing-through-phone.jpg?resize=1200,638",2024-04-13 13:05:32,"""Use an ad blocker to protect your privacy from government spyware via malicious ads.
