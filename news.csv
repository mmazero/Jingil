Tesla's Q1 earnings release, price cuts, and robotaxi plans underscore its focus on autonomy. Amidst a 43% share price drop, Tesla aims to increase FSD adoption with reduced prices and expedite robotaxi development, causing some shifts in the company's strategy.","Title: Navigating Tesla's Shift in Priorities: A Focus on Autonomy and Earnings Preview

Tesla investors, bracing for potentially underwhelming Q1 earnings, are adjusting to CEO Elon Musk's renewed emphasis on autonomous driving technology. As Tesla prepares to report its Q1 earnings after markets close on Tuesday, the company faces a narrowing profit margin due to its significant investment in self-driving technology.

Amid a 43% drop in share price since the beginning of the year, Tesla's earnings call, scheduled for 5:30 pm ET, will likely reveal unimpressive financial results. Despite the gloomy outlook, Tesla shares experienced a brief surge of over 2% on Tuesday morning ahead of the earnings release.

Musk's intensified focus on automated driving is reflected in two key areas: expanding the reach of the advanced driver-assistance system, referred to as ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD), and accelerating the development of a robotaxi. In a recent move, Tesla lowered the price of its FSD system from $12,000 to $8,000, and the monthly subscription dropped from $199 to $99. These reductions aim to increase FSD adoption, enabling Tesla to gather more data for enhancing its neural networks and moving closer to full-scale autonomy.

However, Tesla's commitment to autonomous driving comes with a hefty price tag. In response to the growing expenses, the company recently laid off 10% of its staff, as announced in an email from Musk to all employees. The layoffs are part of a broader cost-cutting strategy to prepare Tesla for its ""next growth phase.""

In a sudden shift, Musk announced that Tesla would pause the development of its $25,000 electric vehicle to prioritize the production of a robotaxi, set to be unveiled in August. This unexpected change in focus, which reportedly caught Tesla employees off guard, highlights the company's dedication to self-driving technology.

Introduction

In our increasingly connected world, access to reliable and fast Wi-Fi is essential. As the number of wireless devices continues to grow, so does the demand for efficient wireless local-area networks (WLANs). However, the IEEE802.11 WLAN standards, while remarkable, are not without their flaws. Slow users, interference, and limited communication channels can negatively impact the performance of an entire network. To tackle these challenges, researchers have been exploring cooperative strategies that encourage users to adjust their positions to enhance system throughput.

A Novel Approach Using Game Theory

A team of researchers, including Associate Professor Sumiko Miyata from Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT), has developed a new AP connection method based on game theory. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on decision-making within clearly defined frameworks. By applying game theory, the researchers aimed to create a model that would maximize system throughput while accounting for user positions and inter-user interference.

The researchers developed a potential game model, whose objective function is to maximize system throughput. This model considers the incentives for all users, allowing for the impact of new users joining a WLAN on existing users to be taken into account. Additionally, the new approach calculates the probabilities of packet collisions, addressing inter-user interference.

Comparing the Proposed Strategy with Previous Methods

The researchers tested their proposed AP connection strategy, which was directly based on the potential game model, by comparing it with previous AP connection methods. They analyzed the resulting AP throughput for each method in various scenarios involving different user positions. The results showed that the proposed strategy consistently resulted in throughput improvements compared to other techniques, with the improvement in system performance reaching up to 6% in some cases.

Potential Applications

Although having a router prompt existing or new users to move around might not be feasible in every situation, the proposed strategy could find a home in certain environments. For instance, Wi-Fi services in classrooms and libraries could benefit from this approach due to their location-free characteristics and low human traffic. The Wi-Fi system would calculate the optimal user positions based on their locations to enhance overall throughput and encourage users to take cooperative action, motivated by a desire to increase their own through",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-winwin-approach-maxi.jpg,2024-04-22 15:57:43,"""Optimize Wi-Fi performance via user cooperation: A game theory approach.

In our rapidly evolving world, electronic devices are becoming increasingly complex, boasting an array of functions that make our lives more convenient. However, this growing complexity can lead to performance and safety issues, such as overheating and microwave emission. To address these challenges, scientists have turned to innovative solutions using advanced materials.

A team of Chinese researchers from Beijing Normal University and the University of Science and Technology Beijing has developed a groundbreaking shield for electronic devices using multifunctional composite phase change materials (PCMs). These man-made materials, created by combining different types of elements, can enhance thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption in electronic devices.

The researchers drew inspiration from biological systems to build a neural network-like aerogel to improve thermal management and microwave absorption efficiency. This innovative material, called functionally integrated composite PCMs, holds great potential for highly integrated and miniaturized electronic devices operating in complex and variable outdoor environments.

To ensure the desired properties, the researchers carefully selected the elements for their new aerogel shield. They aimed to improve thermal management, optimize heat dissipation and storage, enable solar-thermal conversion for device start-up in cold environments, and absorb microwave emissions.

Thermally enhanced PCMs can store and release massive energy as latent heat, making them ideal for precise temperature control. When the temperature increases, these composites undergo phase change from solid to liquid, increasing heat storage. During cooling, the liquid reverts to solid. However, pure PCMs are not effective in solar-thermal conversion. This is where bacterial cellulose (BC) comes in.

BC is a highly desirable natural biomass due to its numerous advantages, including biodegradability, low cost, high purity, renewability, easy modification, and functionalization. BC-derived carbon nanofiber, through high-temperature carbonization, has been considered a promising solar-thermal material.

To tackle microwave emissions, the researchers focused on metal-organic frameworks, which have exceptional porosity, adjustable pore structure, and high specific surface area.

The advent of smart windows has ushered in a new era of energy-efficient buildings, offering the potential to reduce energy costs and promote sustainability. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to high costs and other factors. A groundbreaking study by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin aims to address these challenges through innovative electrochromic devices and materials.

Smart windows: A game-changer in energy efficiency

Before delving into the nitty-gritty of the study, let's take a closer look at smart windows and their significance. These windows possess the remarkable ability to regulate the amount of light and heat that enters a building, thereby reducing energy consumption associated with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Although smart windows have already made their way into the market, their widespread use is not yet prevalent, primarily due to cost and other constraints.

A sustainable solution for smart windows

Enter the world of sustainability and innovation. The researchers have developed a new type of electrochromic device that utilizes eco-friendly, low-cost, and abundant biomass materials, such as amylose, a natural polymer found in corn, potatoes, and beans. Led by Professor Guihua Yu from the Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Texas Materials Institute, the team has successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials to achieve exceptional optical properties, affordability, sustainability, and ease of preparation for electrochromic materials and devices.

The magic behind the color change

At the heart of this technology lies electrochromism, which refers to the ability to change colors in response to an electric field. In the context of smart windows, this color change enables the filtering of light based on heating and cooling requirements. By applying a low voltage, the researchers demonstrated the capacity to alter the amount of light the device transmitted by more than 85% and modulate its transmission of ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra.

A researcher from Virginia Commonwealth University has made a groundbreaking advancement in the field of deception detection. By training a computer to analyze data from a 2002 game show, the researcher, Xunyu Chen, has developed a method to predict whether an individual is being dishonest (Chen et al., 2023). This innovative approach holds the potential to revolutionize the way we identify deceit in various high-stakes situations, such as presidential debates, business negotiations, and court trials.

The basis of this research lies in the exploration of human behaviors as a rich source of deception and trust cues. Chen and his team utilized artificial intelligence methods, such as machine learning and deep learning, to exploit these sources of information more effectively. The team focused on a novel dataset derived from the American game show ""Friend or Foe?"" which is based on the prisoner's dilemma game theory. This theory examines how two individuals can benefit from cooperating or suffer from failing to do so, making it an ideal platform to study trust and deception.

Traditional lab experiments used to study trust and deception have limitations in terms of realism and generalizability. High-stakes deception, as observed in game shows, demands greater cognitive resources for behavioral management compared to low-stakes, fictitious cases. Furthermore, substantial gains or punishments associated with high-stakes decisions may cause stronger emotional and behavioral variations in cues, such as facial, verbal, and movement fluctuations.

Chen's team discovered multimodal behavioral indicators of deception and trust in high-stakes decision-making scenarios. These indicators could predict deception with high accuracy, leading to the concept of an automated deception detector. This research not only extends our understanding of deception and trust behaviors that could lead to significant consequences but also provides valuable insights from a scientific and quantitative perspective.

In the age of artificial intelligence, harnessing the power of machine learning and deep learning to analyze human behaviors can lead to remarkable advancements in decision-making. Researchers and practitioners can apply the findings from this research to analyze human behaviors in high-stakes scenarios, allowing for better prediction of deception and protection of self-interest.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University have inched us closer to a future where virtual and augmented reality seamlessly blend with our natural environment. By utilizing high-definition 3D holographic images, the team aims to create immersive displays in an ordinary pair of eyeglasses, thereby eliminating the need for clunky headsets (Heide et al., 2024).

Holographic images possess a significant advantage over traditional monitors, as they are three-dimensional, providing real depth as opposed to simulated depth on a 2D screen. Due to this inherent characteristic, holographic images can be integrated effortlessly into our everyday view of the world, potentially revolutionizing various aspects of our lives.

Imagine navigating through city streets with holographic directions overlaid on the road ahead, or surgical staff monitoring a patient's vital signs through high-fidelity holographic displays. These are just a few examples of how this technology could transform our interactions with the environment.

A major hurdle in holographic display technology is achieving the desired image quality. Conventional spatial light modulators can only produce images that are either small and clear or large and fuzzy, resulting in a narrow field of view. To tackle this challenge, the Princeton University team developed a neural Ã©tendue expander, consisting of a custom-built optical element designed to work in tandem with the spatial light modulator (Tseng et al., 2024).

This innovative device filters light from the spatial light modulator, expanding the field of view while maintaining the stability and fidelity of the image. The result is a larger image with minimal quality degradation, bringing us one step closer to realizing practical applications for holographic displays.

The neural Ã©tendue expander functions similarly to an etched piece of frosted glass, with the key difference being the precisely designed pattern. Utilizing AI and optical techniques, the etched surface scatters light in a way that pushes certain image elements into frequency bands less perceptible to the human eye.

By studying the malfunctions within four Super Mario platforming gamesâ€”Super Mario Bros (1985), Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988), Super Mario World (1990) and Super Mario 64 (1996)â€”researchers hope to shed light on how these unique bugs could help software engineers create more robust applications.

Although the Super Mario games are decades old, they remain popular among speedrunners, who continuously break records and uncover new glitches. The team analyzed 237 known glitches within these games, classifying various weaknesses to understand whether they resemble bugs found in conventional software.

The Influential Mario Series

The Mario series, one of Nintendo's flagship products, has significantly impacted the video game industry. In the Super Mario platforming games, players navigate Mario through various platforms, collecting power-ups and coins while avoiding enemies. The series' unique design and engaging gameplay have made it a timeless classic, attracting both casual and competitive gamers.

Understanding the Glitches

The University of Bristol's research team, led by Dr. Joseph Hallett, studied the constraints of early video game hardware, which often led to aggressive optimization and unique techniques. These techniques, however, sometimes resulted in bugs due to the hardware's limitations.

Dr. Hallett explained, ""Many of these techniques are niche and can lead to bugs, being so different to how many program",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/super-mario.jpg,2024-04-23 16:10:05,"Meta Description:

A new, revolutionary technology is taking the world of metal recovery by storm. Developed by a team led by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi at the Water Resource Cycle Research Center of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), this innovative method uses textile materials to selectively recover high-purity gold from electrical and electronic waste containing various metals. This breakthrough is published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.

Traditionally, adsorbents for metal recovery are granular in shape, which increases adsorption efficiency based on high specific surface area. However, they are challenging to control underwater, resulting in low recovery rates and even secondary environmental pollution. On the other hand, fiber-like materials are easy to control underwater and can be made into various shapes through the weaving process, making them highly suitable for industrial applications. Unfortunately, their thin thickness and low strength make them susceptible to breaking during the gold recovery process.

To address this challenge, KIST researchers have chemically immobilized alkaline molecules on the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers. This improvement enhances both molecular gold recovery performance and structural stability. The amine-containing polymer fiber has a dramatically larger surface area, which can improve the adsorption performance of gold ions (Au) in waste by up to 2.5 times compared to the team's previously developed granular gold adsorption material.

This new material, called the alkylamine-laden polymeric fiber (ALPF), exhibits impressive gold recovery performance, regardless of the pH of the Au solution. The FESEM images of the ALPF surface after Au recovery show the Au(0) particles on the ALPF surface, while the XRD patterns confirm the presence of gold on the ALPF after recovery in the pH range of 2-12.

The ALPF's durability is also noteworthy. Even after exposure to various initial concentrations (Ci) of gold solution for 24 hours with stirring at 200 rpm, the ALPF remains intact. The FESEM-EDS mapping of the chemical elements distributions for the ALPF after Au recovery further demonstrates the even distribution of gold on the ALPF surface.

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), tech giants are in a race to build increasingly large and sophisticated AI models. However, Microsoft is taking a different approach by focusing on the potential of smaller AI models. The company recently introduced Phi-3 Mini, the first in a series of three compact models, designed to deliver excellent results while maintaining energy efficiency.

Phi-3 Mini was trained on 3.8 billion parameters, a relatively small number compared to some of its competitors. Microsoft plans to release Phi-3 Small and Phi-3 Medium, with 7 billion and 14 billion parameters, respectively, in the coming months. For context, OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo is rumored to have been trained on over a trillion parameters, while Meta's final Llama 3 model, launching in 2024, will have been trained on 700 billion parameters.

The advantage of smaller models like Phi-3 Mini is that they require less power and energy to deliver results, making them more suitable for lower-powered devices such as smartphones. Microsoft can leverage Phi-3 Mini for mobile devices where on-device AI performance is constrained by chipset power and battery life.

Despite its diminutive size, Phi-3 Mini doesn't compromise on performance, according to Microsoft. The company claims that Phi-3 Mini delivers the same performance as models trained on more than 10 times the number of parameters used in Phi-3 Mini. Although it might not match the capabilities of GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo, it is as capable as GPT-3.5.

To achieve this performance, Microsoft trained Phi-3 Mini using a ""curriculum"" that included children's books. This approach allowed the model to learn and generate AI-generated children's books to supplement its real-world material.

Microsoft is offering Phi-3 Mini for free on its Azure cloud platform, model collaboration site Hugging Face, and AI model service Ollama.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-framework-generate-human-motions-language.html,A new framework to generate human motions from language prompts, AI Framework for Language-Guided Human Motion Generation in 3D Scenes with Scene Affordance ,"Title: Enhancing Language-Guided Human Motion Generation with Scene Affordance

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the realm of content generation. While AI has become proficient in creating realistic images based on textual descriptions, the generation of human motion in videos based on human instructions has remained a challenging task. A team of researchers from Beijing Institute of Technology, BIGAI, and Peking University has introduced a novel two-stage framework that effectively generates human motion in 3D scenes based on language guidance, significantly improving the AI's ability to generalize to new, unseen scenarios.

In their previous work, HUMANIZE, the researchers discovered that decomposing the task into scene grounding and conditional motion generation could enhance language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. Inspired by the positive impact of affordance on the model's generalization ability in robotics, they incorporated scene affordance as an intermediate representation in their new framework.

The proposed framework consists of two primary stages: Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) and Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM). ADM predicts the scene affordance map from the language description, while AMDM generates human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance map. By utilizing affordance maps derived from the distance field between human skeleton joints and scene surfaces, the model effectively links 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation inherent in this task.

This new framework offers several advantages over previous approaches for language-guided human motion generation. The representations used by the model clearly define the region associated with a user's descriptions or prompts, improving its 3D grounding capabilities and enabling the creation of convincing motions with limited training data. Additionally, the affordance maps utilized by the model provide a deep understanding of the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, aiding its generalization across diverse scene geometries.

The primary contribution of this work lies in leveraging explicit scene affordance representation to facilitate language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. The researchers believe that their model and its underlying approach will inspire further innovation within the generative AI research community. The model could be refined and applied to various real-world problems, such as producing realistic animated films using AI or generating realistic synthetic training data for robotics applications",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-new-framework-to-gen.jpg,2024-04-23 06:40:01,"""Generate human motions in 3D scenes from language prompts with our novel framework, Scene-Motion.
