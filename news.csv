In our increasingly digital world, electronic devices are becoming more complex, boasting an ever-growing number of functions. While this complexity offers numerous benefits, it also presents challenges, such as device overheating and microwave emissions that can affect performance and pose health risks. To tackle these issues, a team of Chinese scientists has developed a novel shielding solution using multifunctional composite phase change materials (PCMs).

Led by Xiao Chen from Beijing Normal University, the researchers drew inspiration from biological systems to create a neural network-like aerogel that enhances thermal management and microwave absorption in electronic devices. This groundbreaking development was published in Nano Energy Research on April 3.

To achieve the desired properties, the team carefully selected elements to incorporate into their new aerogel shield, focusing on improved thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption. They aimed to create a composite material that could store and release energy efficiently, capture solar energy for device start-up in colder climates, and absorb microwave emissions.

The researchers recognized the potential of thermally enhanced PCMs for precise temperature control. These materials can store and release massive amounts of energy as latent heat during phase changes from solid to liquid and back again. However, pure PCMs are not ideal for solar-thermal conversion. To address this, the team turned to bacterial cellulose (BC), a highly desirable natural biomass with numerous advantages, including biodegradability, low cost, high purity, renewability, and easy modification. BC-derived carbon nanofiber, obtained through high-temperature carbonization, has shown promise as a solar-thermal material.

For microwave absorption, the researchers focused on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have exceptional porosity, adjustable pore structure, and high specific surface area. MOFs can efficiently absorb microwave energy through scattering or multiple reflection due to their porous network structure.

The team encased the resulting composite in paraffin wax, which can undergo phase change, as a thermal storage method. After fabrication, they tested the composite hybrid aerogel to determine its effectiveness in maintaining the desired characteristics.

","Title: A Leap Towards Seamless Integration of Holographic Images in Our Daily Life

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University have taken us one step closer to a future where high-definition 3D holographic images blend seamlessly with the real world in an ordinary pair of eyeglasses. This development marks the beginning of a new era for immersive displays, combining the physical and virtual worlds in a way that feels natural and intuitive.

Holographic images possess a genuine sense of depth, unlike monitors that simulate depth on a two-dimensional screen. Since we perceive the world in three dimensions, holographic images can be integrated effortlessly into our everyday view, creating a truly immersive virtual and augmented reality experience. The user can move their head freely without losing sight of the holographic images, unlike the limited viewing experience offered by current monitor-based virtual reality displays.

Felix Heide, assistant professor of computer science and senior author of the study, eloquently describes the potential of holography: ""Holography could make virtual and augmented reality displays easily usable, wearable, and ultrathin. They could transform how we interact with our environments, everything from getting directions while driving, to monitoring a patient during surgery, to accessing plumbing instructions while doing a home repair.""

The primary challenge in realizing this vision lies in the quality of holographic images. Until now, spatial light modulators, the small chip-like devices responsible for creating holographic images, have been limited to producing either small, clear images or large, fuzzy ones. This tradeoff results in a narrow field of view, insufficient for delivering an immersive experience to the user.

To tackle this issue, Heide, along with Nathan Matsuda, research scientist at Meta, and Ethan Tseng, doctoral student in computer science, developed a device that enhances image quality and broadens the field of view. By adding a custom-built optical element that works in conjunction with the spatial light modulator, the team was able to expand the field of view while preserving image stability and fidelity.

This new optical element, designed with AI and optical techniques, scatters light in a precise manner, pushing certain image elements into frequency bands that are less perceptible to",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/holographic-displays-o-1.jpg,2024-04-23 12:23:16,"Wear high-definition 3D holographic eyeglasses.

Introduction

In an era where sustainability and resource efficiency are paramount, a South Korean research team led by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has made a groundbreaking discovery. They have developed a technology that selectively recovers high-purity gold from electrical and electronic waste containing various metals using textile materials. This innovative approach provides a solution to the challenges of conventional adsorbents and offers a promising approach to metal recovery in the circular economy.

Challenges of Conventional Adsorbents

Traditional adsorbents for metal recovery are typically granular, which increases adsorption efficiency due to their high specific surface area. However, they are difficult to control underwater, resulting in low recovery rates and potential secondary environmental pollution. Fiber-like materials, on the other hand, are more manageable in water and can be formed into various shapes through weaving processes. Despite their advantages, fiber-like materials are prone to breakage during gold recovery applications due to their thinness and low strength.

The KIST Team's Solution

To address these challenges, the KIST research team chemically immobilized alkaline molecules on the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers. This modification resulted in a fiber with a dramatically larger surface area, enhancing the adsorption performance of gold ions (Au) in waste by up to 2.5 times compared to the team's previously developed granular gold adsorption material.

The fiber-like adsorbent, called alkylamine-laden polymeric fiber (ALPF), demonstrates impressive gold recovery performance and structural stability. The team successfully recovered gold ions from waste solutions with varying pH levels, initial concentrations, and adsorbent doses. The SEM images and XRD patterns further confirm the successful recovery of gold particles on the ALPF surface.

ALPF: The Next Generation Adsorbent

The ALPF adsorbent exhibits excellent adsorption selectivity for Au(III) ions in the presence of coexisting metal ions. This characteristic is crucial for practical applications, as waste solutions often contain multiple metal ions.

In a world where tech giants are competing to build increasingly larger artificial intelligence (AI) models, Microsoft is taking a different approach. The company is focusing on the potential of smaller AI models, launching Phi-3 Mini as the first in a series of three compact models. This move underscores the significance of smaller AI models that are both energy-efficient and suitable for various devices, including smartphones.

Phi-3 Mini, trained on 3.8 billion parameters, is the smallest of the trio Microsoft plans to release. Following Phi-3 Mini will be Phi-3 Small, trained on 7 billion parameters, and Phi-3 Medium, trained on 14 billion parameters. These numbers may seem small compared to OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, which boasts over 1 trillion parameters, or Meta's Llama 3, which will reportedly have 700 billion parameters. However, smaller models have their unique advantages.

The primary advantage of smaller AI models is their lower power and energy requirements, making them ideal for less powerful devices with constraints on chipset power and battery life. Phi-3 Mini, for example, could be integrated into mobile devices, providing on-device AI performance without relying on cloud-based solutions.

Despite its relatively diminutive size, Phi-3 Mini delivers impressive results. According to Microsoft, it offers the same performance as models trained on more than 10 times the number of parameters used for Phi-3 Mini. Although it may not match the capabilities of GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo, it rivals GPT-3.5 in terms of performance.

To achieve this level of competence, Microsoft trained Phi-3 Mini using a curriculum that included children's books. By incorporating real-world materials and AI-generated children's books, the company ensured that the model could cater to a wide range of users, including children.

Microsoft is making Phi-3 Mini available on its Azure cloud platform, Hugging Face's model collaboration site, and Ollama's AI model service.

Introduction

Imagine a world where renewable energy is harnessed from the most unexpected places, like where salty oceans meet freshwater rivers. This blue energy, also known as osmotic power, is generated due to the differences in salt concentration. Recently, scientists have been exploring this untapped source of renewable energy. A team of researchers has developed a cutting-edge semipermeable membrane that significantly enhances the conversion of osmotic energy into electricity, paving the way for a more sustainable future.

The Power of Blue Energy and Current Limitations

Estuaries, the regions where rivers mix with the sea, are abundant in blue energy. Here, salt gradients offer a potential source of sustainable power. Although osmotic energy can be harvested anywhere salt gradients are found, current technologies have limitations. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) membranes, which function like a 'salt battery,' generate electricity from pressure differences caused by the salt gradient. However, these available technologies require improvement to optimize electricity capture.

Improving Osmotic Energy Harvesting

Previous research indicates that the key to boosting osmotic energy-harvesting performance lies in enhancing both ion transport across RED membranes and the efficiency of electron transport. Aiming to maximize output power, Dongdong Ye, Xingzhen Qin, and their colleagues designed a semipermeable membrane using eco-friendly materials that could theoretically minimize internal resistance and maximize output power.

Designing a Game-Changing Membrane

The researchers' RED membrane prototype featured separate channels for ion transport and electron transport. This was achieved by placing a negatively charged cellulose hydrogel (for ion transport) between layers of an organic, electrically conductive polymer called polyaniline (for electron transport).

Results and Testing

Preliminary testing confirmed that decoupled transport channels led to higher ion conductivity and lower resistivity compared to homogenous membranes made from the same materials. In an estuary-simulating water tank, the prototype outperformed a commercial RED membrane, demonstrating an impressive 2.34 times higher output power density. Moreover, the prototype maintained stability during 16 days",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/this-salt-battery-harv.jpg,2024-04-24 08:23:03,"of continuous operation, highlighting its potential for long-term use.

A team of researchers from the University of California, Irvine, sought to change this narrative by emulating aging and neurodegeneration in AI agents, thereby paving the way for innovative and specialized AI systems.

The research team, comprised of Yu-Dai Tsai, Antonios Alexos, and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, aimed to create cognitive declines in AI agents to better understand complex systems, enhance their interpretability, and improve security. This groundbreaking study was inspired by a dinner conversation between Tsai, Dr. Baldi, and Dr. Pishgar, as well as Tsai's personal experience with his father's cognitive decline following a brain trauma.

To introduce the concept of 'neural erosion,' the researchers used IQ tests performed by large language models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA 2 model. Neural erosion involves deliberately ablating synapses or neurons or adding Gaussian noise during or after training, resulting in a controlled decline in the LLMs' performance.

Intriguingly, the researchers discovered that when they ablated some of the artificial synapses or neurons of the LLaMA 2 model, its performance declined, following a specific pattern. This observation could offer valuable insights into the functioning of complex AI systems and the capabilities that are most resilient or vulnerable when their underlying structure is compromised.

The LLaMA 2 model first lost its ability to think in abstract ways, followed by mathematical degradation, and ultimately, a loss in linguistic skills, rendering it unable to respond to prompts coherently. This 'neuro-erosion' pattern shares similarities with the neurodegeneration patterns observed in humans.

By splitting data, using bus-probing resistance, and digital in-memory compute, this chip balances security and efficiency, reducing data transfers and protecting sensitive user information.","Title: A Secure and Efficient Machine-Learning Accelerator for Health Monitoring Apps

Introduction

Health-monitoring apps have become increasingly popular, enabling users to track fitness goals or manage chronic diseases using only a smartphone. However, these apps often rely on massive machine-learning models that require significant data transfers between a smartphone and a central server, leading to slow performance and high energy consumption. Moreover, the hardware accelerators designed to improve computational efficiency are often vulnerable to attacks that can compromise sensitive user data.

A team of researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have developed a machine-learning accelerator that is resistant to two common types of attacks while maintaining computational efficiency. This secure and efficient chip can protect user data, such as health records and financial information, while enabling large AI models to run on devices.

The Challenge: Balancing Security and Efficiency

Engineers often use hardware accelerators to speed up machine-learning computations by reducing data transfers between the smartphone and the central server. However, these accelerators are susceptible to attacks that can expose sensitive user data, such as side-channel attacks (which monitor power consumption to reverse-engineer data) and bus-probing attacks (which steal bits of the model and dataset by probing the communication between the accelerator and the off-chip memory).

Digital in-memory compute (IMC) chips perform computations inside a device's memory, where pieces of a machine-learning model are stored. By breaking the model into smaller pieces and reusing them as much as possible, IMC chips can reduce data transfers and improve efficiency. However, their complexity makes it challenging to implement traditional security measures, and IMC chips remain vulnerable to side-channel and bus-probing attacks.

The Solution: A Three-Pronged Approach to Security

To address these vulnerabilities, the researchers employed a three-pronged approach:

1. Data Splitting: The team split data in the IMC into random pieces, ensuring that a side-channel attack could never reconstruct the real information, even when monitoring power consumption.
2. Bus-Probing Resistance: To resist bus-probing attacks, the researchers encrypted the model stored in off-chip memory using a lightweight cipher.

Introduction

Imagine a world where buildings can adapt to their surroundings, regulating light and heat automatically to save energy and create a comfortable environment. This concept is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction, thanks to the revolutionary development of smart windows. Although these energy-efficient innovations have already made their way into the market, widespread adoption remains hampered by cost and other limiting factors. However, a group of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin is poised to change this scenario with their new type of electrochromic device and materials.

The Groundbreaking Discovery

In a pioneering study, these researchers have harnessed the power of sustainable materials to create smart windows that are not only more affordable but also better for the environment. By utilizing common, low-cost, and eco-friendly building blocks such as amylose, a natural polymer found in corn, potatoes, and beans, the team has successfully developed a novel electrochromic device that offers excellent optical properties and energy-saving potential (1).

Led by Professor Guihua Yu from the Cockrell School of Engineering's Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Texas Materials Institute, the researchers have highlighted the importance of developing sustainable electrochromic materials and devices to drive the mainstream adoption of smart windows.

How It Works

Electrochromism is the ability to change colors based on the application of a voltage. In the case of smart windows, this color change enables the filtering of light in response to heating and cooling needs. The researchers demonstrated the capability to decrease or increase the amount of light the device transmitted by more than 85% and modulate its transmission of ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra using a low voltage (1).

The newly developed technology was tested under various conditions, including more than six weeks of ultraviolet exposure, 1,200 cycles of use, and 4,000 switches between light permeability. The results showed that the simple, readily available materials, combined with a reusable, transparent electrode, played a crucial role in the discovery's success.

Introduction

Can machines uncover the truth in high-stakes situations? A Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) researcher has trained a computer to do just that, by analyzing human behaviors associated with deception and trust. This innovative approach to deception detection, detailed in the study ""Trust and Deception with High Stakes: Evidence from the 'Friend or Foe' Dataset,"" published in Decision Support Systems, holds the potential to revolutionize the way we analyze and predict deception in various fields, from politics to business negotiations and legal proceedings.

Leveraging Game Show Data for Deception Detection

Led by Xunyu Chen, assistant professor in the Department of Information Systems at VCU's School of Business, the research team employed a novel dataset derived from the American game show ""Friend or Foe?"" Based on the prisoner's dilemma game theory, this show presents realistic and high-stakes deception scenarios, unlike the often unrealistic and low-stakes laboratory experiments typically used to study trust and deception.

High-stakes deception, such as that found in the game show, demands greater cognitive resources for behavioral management, resulting in more robust emotional and behavioral cues. These cues include facial expressions, verbal and movement fluctuations, which the study's machine learning algorithms were able to identify and analyze to predict deception with remarkable accuracy.

The researchers discovered multimodal behavioral indicators of deception and trust in high-stakes decision-making scenarios, which could be used to develop an automated deception detector. This innovative predictor would enable analysts to identify deceit in real-life, high-stakes situations, providing valuable insights for decision-makers in various fields.

Implications and Applications of Deception Detection Technology

This research offers the potential to expand our understanding of deception and trust behaviors in high-stakes scenarios from a scientific and quantitative perspective. The findings can be applied to various contexts, such as political debates, business negotiations, and court trials, to predict deception and protect self-interest.

Introduction

Automation continues to be a significant trend in the enterprise world, and one of the frontrunners in this space is Tines, a Dublin-founded startup specializing in security workflow automation. With a 200% revenue increase over the past 18 months, Tines has now raised $50 million in an extended Series B funding round led by existing investors Accel and Felicis. This new capital will enable Tines to expand its platform and venture deeper into infrastructure, engineering, and product applications.

The Funding

The latest funding for Tines is being described as an extension of its Series B rather than a Series C. The company's existing investors, Accel and Felicis, led the round, which was finalized in a matter of weeks. Tines, currently not profitable, aims to focus on growth and expansion with this new funding.

The Gap in the Market

Tines addresses a gap in the market based on its founders' firsthand experience working in cybersecurity for companies like DocuSign, eBay, and Deloitte. They observed significant shortcomings in tools to manage the numerous services used for tracking data and network activity. With the rise of cloud computing and related innovations, the need for more advanced security workflow automation has only increased.

Tines' Solution

Tines offers mission-critical workflows for security, including security alert monitoring, compliance alert management, and overseeing areas adjacent to security teams' responsibilities, such as employee onboarding and offboarding. The platform aims to simplify workflow creation, management, and automation using a drag-and-drop, no-code framework. This approach reduces the technical burden on security teams while providing them with a powerful tool to manage their workflows effectively.

A Focused and Context-Aware Approach

Tines faces competition from established players like Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. However, Tines, its investors, and users argue that the startup's focused and context-aware approach makes it more useful and effective than its competitors, especially with regard to customer satisfaction.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-framework-generate-human-motions-language.html,A new framework to generate human motions from language prompts, Language-Guided Human Motion Generation Boosted with Scene Affordance ,"Title: Enhancing Language-Guided Human Motion Generation with Scene Affordance

In recent years, machine learning-based models capable of generating various types of content have significantly advanced, opening up new opportunities for filmmaking and robotics training datasets. However, creating AI that can generate videos of moving human figures based on human instructions has proven to be a challenging task. A groundbreaking new framework, presented at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024, addresses this challenge by effectively generating human motion in 3D scenes based on language descriptions.

A collaborative effort between researchers from Beijing Institute of Technology, BIGAI, and Peking University, the new framework advances a previously introduced generative model, HUMANIZE, aiming to improve its ability to generalize across new problems. The researchers employed scene affordance as an intermediate representation, which significantly enhanced the model's motion generation capabilities on benchmarks such as HumanML3D and HUMANISE, and boosted its ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.

Yixin Zhu, a co-author of the paper, explained that early experiments in their previous work, HUMANIZE, indicated that a two-stage framework could enhance language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. This observation inspired them to utilize scene affordance as an intermediate representation to tackle this complex task.

The proposed method unfolds in two stages:

1. Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for affordance map prediction
2. Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM) for generating human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance

By employing scene affordance maps derived from the distance field between human skeleton joints and scene surfaces, the model effectively links 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation. This linkage results in a framework that outperforms previously introduced approaches for language-guided human motion generation in several ways:

1. Improved 3D grounding capabilities: The representations used by the model clearly define the region associated with the user's descriptions/prompts, enhancing its ability to create convincing motions with limited training data.

2. Better geometric understanding: The maps offer a deep understanding of the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, aiding the model's generalization across diverse",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-new-framework-to-gen.jpg,2024-04-23 06:40:01,"""Discover Tines' IT automation advancements, empowering security teams with efficient workflow solutions.
