The White House envisions a zero-emission freight industry by 2040, with 30% of industrial truck sales achieving zero emissions by 2030. The Biden Administration plans to engage stakeholders in the commercial vehicle, shipping, and infrastructure industries to develop necessary infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will allocate $1 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to replace Class 6 and 7 vehicles with electric counterparts, primarily in communities most affected by industrial pollution. This ambitious plan, however, relies on the outcome of the upcoming US election, as it consists of voluntary, non-binding resolutions.","Title: Biden's Ambitious Plan to Green the US Industrial Freight System

The Biden administration has taken up the challenge of transforming America's industrial freight system into a more eco-friendly entity. On Wednesday, the White House announced its intentions to have 30% of industrial truck sales produce zero emissions by 2030, with a long-term goal of 100% by 2040. These targets, while not legally binding, demonstrate the administration's commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of the freight industry.

The US freight industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 10% of the country's carbon emissions. The transportation sector, as a whole, emits around 29% of US greenhouse gas emissions, with freight (including shipping, trucking, and trains) making up about a third of that figure.

The Biden Administration plans to involve key stakeholders from the commercial vehicle, shipping, and infrastructure industries in a roundtable discussion. The aim is to advance the administration's goal of developing the necessary infrastructure to support a zero-emissions freight ecosystem in the US.

In addition to these ambitious targets, the Biden Administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the allocation of $1 billion in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding. This funding is intended to replace Class 6 and 7 vehicles (such as school buses, garbage trucks, and delivery trucks) with electric equivalents. At least $400 million of this funding will be directed towards communities most impacted by industrial pollution.

The IRA stipulates that these funds must be used to benefit local communities disproportionately affected by industrial pollution. Sadly, people of color and those from low-income households are often most affected by high environmental toxin levels. 

The White House's environmental goals are commendable, given the urgency of the global climate crisis and the freight industry's significant role in emissions. However, these are voluntary, non-binding resolutions that could be undone by a potential future administration. Therefore, the outcome of this November's US election will significantly impact the future of the US freight industry and the nation's climate goals.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University have inched us closer to a future where virtual and augmented reality seamlessly blend with our natural environment. By utilizing high-definition 3D holographic images, these scientists aim to transform ordinary eyeglasses into immersive displays, combining the real and virtual worlds.

Holographic images possess a distinct advantage over conventional monitors due to their inherent three-dimensional nature. Unlike monitors that merely simulate depth on a two-dimensional screen, holographic images can be integrated effortlessly into our regular view of the real world, offering a truly immersive experience. 

The beauty of this technology lies in its potential to overlay holographic images onto our natural field of vision without the need for cumbersome headgear. The optical elements required to create these images are remarkably small and could easily fit on a standard pair of glasses. Contrast this with current virtual reality displays that rely on monitors, necessitating bulky headsets to accommodate the screen and accompanying hardware.

The potential applications for such immersive displays are vast and transformative. They could revolutionize everything from navigation and medical procedures to home repairs, offering a new way to interact with our environment.

However, achieving high-quality holographic images has proven to be a significant challenge. The creation of holographic images relies on spatial light modulators, which, until now, could only produce either small, clear images or large, fuzzy ones. This trade-off between image size and clarity results in a narrow field of view, insufficient for providing an immersive experience.

To tackle this issue, Felix Heide, along with his team, including Nathan Matsuda and Ethan Tseng, developed a secondary optical element to work in harmony with the spatial light modulator. This device filters the light from the modulator, expanding the field of view while preserving the image's stability and fidelity. The result is a larger image with minimal quality degradation.

A groundbreaking study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) reveals that countries with limited access to renewable energy can save up to 20% in the production costs of green steel and 40% in green chemicals by importing from renewable-rich countries. This strategic 'renewables pull' could incentivize businesses to invest in low-emission production facilities in these regions, while renewable-scarce countries focus on downstream production and refinement to maintain industrial competitiveness.

The Key Role of Green Hydrogen

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy sources, plays a pivotal role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in steel and chemical production. However, not all industrialized nations can produce green hydrogen in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices due to geographical constraints. According to Philipp Verpoort, a scientist at PIK and the study's lead author, importing intermediate goods such as iron sponge, ammonia, or methanol and focusing on downstream production and refinement could be a more cost-effective strategy for long-term competitiveness.

Comparing Decarbonization Strategies

To determine the cost-effectiveness of various decarbonization strategies, the researchers analyzed the green value chains of three primary basic materials: steel, urea, and ethylene. They found that an electricity-price difference of 4ct/kWh between some existing renewable-scarce industrial production sites (e.g., Germany, Japan, or South Korea) and favorable locations elsewhere (e.g., Australia, Chile, South Africa) is expected in 2040.

The study demonstrates that cost savings from relocation can be substantial, with importing hydrogen not being a cost-effective strategy, especially when imports occur via ship. Besides cost savings, other factors influence companies' investment decisions, such as benefits of short and integrated value chains, supply chain reliability, quality requirements, and public subsidies for low-emission production. However, these factors alone are unlikely to prevent a partial 'green relocation' of production.

Introduction

As the world shifts towards renewable energy sources, the challenge of managing fluctuations and intermittency in power supply has become increasingly important. Grid-scale energy storage systems, such as flow batteries, have emerged as promising solutions to this problem. Among various types of flow batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have gained significant attention due to their high efficiency, scalability, safety, and near-room-temperature operation conditions. Moreover, VRFBs offer the advantage of independently sizing power and energy capacities, making them an ideal choice for grid-scale applications.

The Importance of Carbon Electrodes in VRFBs

In a redox flow battery, redox reactions occur at the surfaces of the electrodes in contact with the electrolyte. Consequently, any modifications to the electrode surface can significantly impact the electrochemical activity and overall battery performance. Carbon electrodes are widely used in VRFBs due to their excellent electrical conductivity, stability, and low cost. However, their long-term performance and durability can be hindered by degradation during electrochemical cycles.

To address these challenges, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have joined forces to investigate the surface functionality of carbon electrodes and their propensity for degradation. In a recent study published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, the team has employed a coupled experimental-theoretical approach to characterize carbon electrodes prepared under different conditions and identify relevant functional groups responsible for unique spectroscopic features.

The Power of X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations

Using carbon K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of carbon electrodes prepared under various conditions. XAS is an invaluable tool for investigating carbon electrode composition, as it provides element-specific local electronic structure (and thus bonding environment) and depth profiling capabilities, enabling the comparison of surface and bulk electrode composition.

The research team has developed a highly deformable micro-supercapacitor (MSC) that maintains its energy storage performance even after undergoing repeated stretching, twisting, and other mechanical deformations.

Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have gained attention due to their high-power density, rapid charging, and long cycle life, making them an attractive alternative to traditional energy storage devices. However, creating interdigitated electrode patterns that maintain energy storage performance under repeated stretching and twisting has proven challenging. The use of brittle materials like gold (Au) as electrodes adds to this challenge.

To address this issue, the research team utilized eutectic gallium-indium liquid metal (EGaIn) for its high conductivity and deformability. However, patterning EGaIn with high precision is difficult due to its high surface tension. To overcome this hurdle, the team turned to laser ablation, a technique used to selectively remove material, to pattern both EGaIn and graphene layers on a stretchable polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-polystyrene copolymer (SEBS) substrate.

The resulting MSC boasts an impressive areal capacitance that remains unchanged even after stretching for up to 1,000 cycles. Moreover, the fabricated MSCs operate stably under various mechanical deformations, paving the way for a new generation of flexible energy storage devices. This innovation in deformable energy storage offers exciting possibilities for the future development of wearable technology.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

Imagine a world where renewable energy is not just limited to solar, wind, and tidal power. Imagine harnessing energy from the simple process of saltwater and freshwater meeting. This is not a fantasy but a promising reality. Scientists have been exploring the potential of osmotic energy, a form of blue energy, for years. Recently, a significant breakthrough has been made in this field by a team of researchers. They have developed a semipermeable membrane that can harvest osmotic energy more efficiently than ever before.

The Power of Estuaries

Estuaries, where freshwater rivers meet the salty sea, are not just hotspots for birdwatching and kayaking. They are also potential goldmines for sustainable energy. In these areas, waters with different salt concentrations mix, creating a natural salt gradient. This gradient can be a source of osmotic power, a form of renewable energy.

The Challenge of Harvesting Osmotic Energy

While the potential of osmotic energy is immense, the technologies to capture this energy are still in their infancy. One method uses reverse electrodialysis (RED) membranes, which act like a 'salt battery.' These membranes generate electricity from the pressure differences caused by the salt gradient. However, the available technologies have room for improvement.

The Innovation: Decoupled Transport Channels

To enhance the osmotic energy harvesting, Dongdong Ye, Xingzhen Qin, and their team designed a semipermeable membrane from environmentally friendly materials. The membrane has decoupled channels for ion transport and electron transport. This is achieved by sandwiching a negatively charged cellulose hydrogel (for ion transport) between layers of an organic, electrically conductive polymer called polyaniline (for electron transport).

The Results: A Powerful Leap in Osmotic Energy Harvesting

The team's RED membrane prototype showed promising results. Initial tests confirmed that decoupled transport channels resulted in higher ion conductivity and lower resistivity compared to homogenous membranes made from the same materials. In a water tank that simulated an estuary environment, their prototype achieved an output power density 2.34 times",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/this-salt-battery-harv.jpg,2024-04-24 08:23:03,"New semipermeable membrane harvests osmotic energy more efficiently: Harness the power of estuaries with decoupled transport channels for higher power density.

Researchers have developed a system to enable vehicle passengers to enjoy fast-paced VR games, minimizing motion sickness through manipulated speed perception. This innovative approach could transform in-car VR experiences. VR Gaming TechNews","Title: Redefining Virtual Reality Motion Perception in Vehicles: A Leap Towards Comfort and Excitement

In a groundbreaking study, researchers have developed a system that allows vehicle passengers to enjoy fast-paced virtual reality (VR) games without experiencing motion sickness. This innovative approach, which manipulates users' perception of speed through vehicular translational gain and attenuation, is set to revolutionize in-car VR experiences.

Motion sickness is a common issue in VR, caused by a discrepancy between the physical sensations and visual perceptions of movement. While some VR systems attempt to minimize motion sickness by aligning real-world and virtual movements, this research explores the potential of further manipulating users' impressions of movement for enjoyable and practical virtual experiences.

The study introduces the first travel-focused VR system based on translational gain and attenuation principles. Translational gain magnifies or reduces real-world movements in virtual space, while translational attenuation does the opposite. For instance, a half-meter step in a user's living room can translate into a five-meter movement in a virtual space, or large real-world movements can be scaled down to smaller virtual ones.

Dr. Graham Wilson, one of the paper's lead authors, explains, ""Exactly mapping real-world movements to virtual ones reduces the feeling of sickness, but it limits the types of experiences users can have and the range of feelings those experiences can create. Translational gain and attenuation hold a lot of potential for expanding the scope of VR experiences during travel.""

In the study's first phase, 17 participants donned VR headsets and were driven on a 2km route in Glasgow's west end at 50 kilometers per hour. They experienced a virtual city street overlaid with text they were asked to read, followed by multiple-choice questions based on the content. Their perceived speed was manipulated to match, exceed, and fall short of their actual speed in three separate hour-long sessions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, surpassing human capabilities in various tasks. However, unlike the human mind, AI systems typically maintain consistent performance or even enhance their skills over time. A team of researchers from the University of California, Irvine has endeavored to replicate the effects of aging and neurodegeneration in AI agents, mimicking the decline of mental faculties observed in humans. This innovative approach could pave the way for novel AI systems that harness the benefits of 'artificial neurodegeneration' for specific tasks.

The researchers, led by co-author Yu-Dai Tsai, drew inspiration from personal experiences, as well as broader discussions about neurodegeneration, learning, and AI safety. The team emphasizes that their research did not aim to replicate human brain diseases artificially. Instead, their objective was to induce cognitive declines in AI agents to enhance the understanding of complex systems, improve interpretability, and bolster security measures.

To introduce the concept of 'neural erosion,' the researchers utilized IQ tests performed by large language models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA 2. This deliberate erosion involved either ablating synapses or neurons or adding Gaussian noise during or after training. This process resulted in a controlled decline in the LLMs' performance.

The researchers discovered that when they selectively ablated artificial synapses or neurons of the LLaMA 2 model, its performance on IQ tests declined, following a distinct pattern. This finding could shed light on the functioning of complex AI systems and the capabilities that deteriorate first and last when their underlying structure is compromised.

An intriguing observation from the study was that the LLM lost its abstract thinking abilities, followed by mathematical degradation, and ultimately, a loss in linguistic ability, rendering it incapable of responding to prompts coherently. This 'neuro-erosion' pattern aligns with the neurodegeneration patterns observed in humans.

This research could inspire other groups to explore neurodegeneration in AI agents beyond previous works focusing on reproducing human neurodegeneration.

Introduction

Robotics engineers have spent decades and millions of research dollars trying to develop a robot that can match an animal's ability to run or walk over various terrains. However, animals continue to outperform robots in terms of endurance, agility, and robustness. A team of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers set out to investigate the reasons behind this gap and quantify the differences between robots and animals by studying various aspects of running robots and comparing them to their biological counterparts. The study, published in Science Robotics, reveals that while engineering subsystems outperform their biological equivalents, animals excel in integrating and controlling these components.

Comparing Subsystems: Robots vs. Animals

The research team, composed of experts in power, frame, actuation, sensing, and control, studied these five ""subsystems"" in both robots and animals. Previously, it was believed that the superiority of biological components must be responsible for animals' outperformance of robots. However, the study found that engineering subsystems generally outperformed their biological counterparts, with only minor exceptions.

The Power subsystem, which includes energy generation and storage, is a significant factor in robots' performance. In contrast, animals have evolved efficient energy conversion systems. For instance, a human runner's legs store energy during impact and release it during push-off, a mechanism that robots have yet to replicate effectively.

The Frame, or the physical structure of a robot or animal, plays a crucial role in movement and stability. Engineered frames can be optimized for specific tasks, while animals' frames are the result of millions of years of evolution. Animals' frames have demonstrated remarkable versatility and adaptability, making it challenging for robots to match their performance.

Actuation, or the process of converting energy into movement, is another area where robots lag behind animals. While engineers have developed various actuators, such as motors and artificial muscles, they still can't match the efficiency, speed, and adaptability of animal muscles.

Sensing and Control are crucial for movement optimization, and animals excel in these areas. Animals can process sensory information rapidly, allowing them to adapt their movements to changing environments.

Introduction:

As the global population continues to grow, the need for sustainable and efficient food production methods is more important than ever. Edonia, a Paris-based startup, is one of the companies working to address this challenge by producing plant-based ingredients from microalgae biomass. In this article, we will explore Edonia's innovative technology and its plans for the future.

Body:

Edonia is a startup that was founded in 2018 by CEO Hugo Valentin. The company has recently received €2 million ($2.1 million) in funding and is now looking to scale its production of plant-based ingredients from microalgae. Valentin has a long history in the industry, having previously founded Ammi, a company that worked on spirulina consumption.

Edonia's unique microalgae transformation process, called ""edonization,"" transforms the microalgae biomass into a textured super ingredient with numerous taste, odor, texture, nutritional, and environmental qualities. The goal of the technology is to solve the organoleptic (sense organs) aspects of microalgae, which are often associated with a bitter taste and a green powder consistency.

The edonization process involves converting the color of the microalgae from green to a darker, richer-looking brown. It also alters the texture to ""meaty-like tender grains"" with aromatics similar to those produced by smoking or grilling. Edo-1, Edonia's first product, offers an umami-like flavor and texture that is closer to ground meat than soy proteins. It is made from spirulina or chlorella biomass and is 30% protein, composed of essential amino acids, and contains other minerals and vitamins.

In addition to its nutritional benefits, Edonia's product also has environmental benefits. The company has developed a Life Cycle Assessment that shows that its product emits 40 times less carbon dioxide than its ground meat equivalent and three times less than its textured soy equivalent. This makes Edonia's product a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional meat products.

Edonia plans to scale its production and go to market by the end of this year with commercial proofs of concepts. The company is also working with food manufacturers to develop recipes and food products using Edonia's ingredients. Valentin expects to have a full-scale factory in about two years.

Conclusion:

Edonia is a promising startup that is working to address the growing demand for sustainable and efficient food production methods. The company's innovative technology and nutritional and environmental benefits make it a valuable addition to the global market for commercial algae, which is expected to be worth $25.4 billion by 2033. With its focus on solving the organoleptic aspects of microalgae, Edonia is paving the way for a new era of plant-based protein production.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Burger-close-up-LIL_2284-photo-credit-Lilie-Bedos-Edonia.png?resize=1200,676",2024-04-25 06:00:42,"""Discover Edonia's sustainable algae protein: 30% protein, 40x less CO2 than meat.

Imagine a future where air taxis and flying vehicles seamlessly navigate through urban skies, bypassing ground traffic. This vision is not far from reality, as companies are already developing and testing hybrid electric ""flying cars"" that take off and land vertically while efficiently soaring through the air for longer distances. However, ensuring the safety of these autonomous aerial vehicles is of paramount importance, as they must be able to handle disturbances and potential failures during flight.

A team of engineers from Caltech, led by Soon-Jo Chung, Bren Professor of Control and Dynamical Systems, has developed an onboard Machine Learning-based control method to help flying vehicles detect and compensate for disturbances, enabling them to maintain control and continue their journey. Dubbed ""Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance"" (NFFT), this groundbreaking method is detailed in a paper accepted for publication in the journal IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.

The Need for Fault Tolerance in Aerial Vehicles

As engineers build hybrid-electric aircraft with multiple propellers for redundancy, the presence of both rotors and wings creates numerous points of possible failure. Detecting these failures is a challenge, as adding sensors for each rotor may not be sufficient or practical. Chung's team sought an alternative solution to this problem.

Introducing Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance (NFFT)

NFFT is a deep-learning method that builds upon previous efforts to create a system that can respond to strong winds and detect onboard failures in real-time. The system includes a neural network pre-trained on real-life flight data, which adapts and learns from a limited number of changing parameters. These parameters include an estimation of each rotor's effectiveness at any given time.

NFFT does not require any additional sensors or hardware for fault detection and identification. Instead, it observes the aircraft's attitude and position over time. If the aircraft deviates from its desired path, NFFT can detect the issue and compensate for the error in less than a second.

A significant milestone has been reached in the ongoing saga of TikTok's presence in the United States. After bipartisan support in Congress and the President's signature, TikTok faces an uncertain future within America's borders. This article delves into the sequence of events, the key players, and the potential implications of this decision.

The Road to White House Approval

The journey began with a bill that demanded TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest within nine months or face a ban on app stores distributing the app in the U.S. The legislation swiftly passed through both chambers of Congress, receiving a 79-18 vote in the Senate and unanimous approval in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill's primary concern is the potential for TikTok to be leveraged by Chinese authorities due to its Chinese ownership.

Divided Opinions and United Fronts

While some senators initially hesitated to present a united front against TikTok, a significant bipartisan effort eventually emerged. Notable figures such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senators Josh Hawley, Marsha Blackburn, Mark Warner, and Marco Rubio, among others, expressed concerns about TikTok's national security threat. This issue gained traction as it combined national security, data privacy, and the influence of foreign adversaries on American soil.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee took the lead in introducing the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. This bill would make it illegal for software tied to U.S. adversaries, like ByteDance in China, to be distributed by U.S. app stores or supported by U.S. web hosts. If the bill becomes law, Apple's App Store and Google Play could not legally distribute TikTok in the U.S., forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months for the app to continue operating.

The global pandemic forced small coffee shops, which once thrived on foot traffic, to pivot towards technology for survival. As these businesses embraced online orders and payments, startups and venture capitalists saw an opportunity to help. Among these startups is Dripos, a New York-based coffee shop software company founded by Jack Pawlik and Avery Durrant in 2019.

Originally, Dripos aimed to create mobile ordering apps for local coffee shops, similar to Starbucks' offering. However, after interacting with operators and shop owners, Pawlik and Durrant realized there was a more significant problem to address. Many coffee shops relied on simple point-of-sale systems like Square, which, while functional, were not tailored to their specific workflow. To fill the gaps, these shops employed five to ten other software solutions.

In response, Dripos pivoted to develop a comprehensive tool that would integrate point-of-sale, mobile payments, employee management and payroll, loyalty and marketing automation, and administrative functions like accounting and banking. Manny Caral, owner and operator of Revolucion Coffee + Juice with five locations in Texas, switched to Dripos and stated, ""We are able to achieve this and even much more through Dripos... The product has allowed us to streamline our day-to-day operations and give us time back to focus more on our customer experience.""

Dripos' all-in-one solution has resonated with customers, with the company's presence expanding to coffee shops across 46 states in its first full year using the new tool. The number of locations relying on Dripos increased by 400%, processing hundreds of millions in annual payments.

To further invest in technology development and go-to-market strategies, Dripos secured $11 million in Series A funding, led by early-stage venture capital firm Base10 Partners. Base10 principal Caroline Broder, who led the Series A, joins the Dripos board. Broder shared her confidence in Dripos, stating, ""They understand what these business owners want and need and what they're not getting. Then they built something that's very specifically made for them. That customer empathy is a rare quality.""
