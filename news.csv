Byju's Investors Vote to Remove Founder and CEO

In a surprising turn of events, a group of Byju's investors has made a bold move to oust the founder and chief executive, Byju Raveendran, and has taken legal action against the leadership of the edtech giant. This decision, made at an emergency general meeting, reflects a significant shift in the dynamics of the company, once hailed as India's most valuable startup.

The investors, including prominent names like Prosus Ventures and Peak XV Partners, collectively holding over 60% ownership in Byju's, have not only voted for a change in leadership but also passed a resolution to reconstitute the board of directors. This move comes after a prolonged period of unrest among some of Byju's largest investors, who have raised concerns about the company's financial management and compliance issues.

In response to these developments, Byju's has questioned the legitimacy of the resolutions passed at the EGM, emphasizing that only a ""small cohort of select shareholders"" attended the meeting and labeling their decisions as ""invalid and ineffective."" The company's statement underscores the deep divide between the leadership and certain influential investors.

The turmoil within Byju's is further compounded by a separate legal action taken by four investors, representing about 25% ownership in the startup, who have filed a suit at the National Company Law Tribunal to halt the rights issue. This move reflects the escalating tensions and diverging interests within the company's investor base.

Byju's, a prominent player in the Indian edtech space, has faced its share of challenges, including its failed attempt to go public in early 2022 and subsequent struggles to secure new funding. The startup's ambitious plans have been met with setbacks, such as the abrupt departure of key board members and challenges in raising substantial capital.

The recent launch of a rights issue, aimed at raising about $200 million at a discounted rate, has been a focal point of contention. Raveendran's call for existing investors to participate in the rights issue has been met with skepticism, with some investors expressing concerns about the potential impact on the company's value.

As Byju's navigates through this period of uncertainty and internal discord, the edtech giant finds itself at a critical juncture, grappling with governance issues and the need to regain investor confidence. The outcome of these developments will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of one of India's most prominent startups.

In the fast-paced world of tech and startups, the dynamics of leadership and investor relations can often be as influential as the products and services themselves. The unfolding saga at Byju's serves as a compelling reminder of the intricate interplay between stakeholders and the pivotal role they play in shaping the destiny of a company.

A dramatic turn of events unfolded at Byju's as a group of investors, including Prosus Ventures and Peak XV Partners, voted to remove the founder and CEO, Byju Raveendran, and filed a suit against the leadership to block a recently launched rights issue. The investors, who collectively own over 60% of Byju's, passed resolutions to reconstitute the board and change the leadership at an emergency general meeting. Byju's founder and other board members did not attend the meeting. In response, a shareholder group provided a statement, asserting the validity of the meeting's outcome and their confidence in their position, which they plan to present to the Karnataka High Court. Additionally, four investors representing about 25% ownership in Byju's filed a suit at the National Company Law Tribunal to halt the rights issue.

This development comes after more than a year of unrest among some of Byju's largest investors, who have raised concerns about the startup's accountability. Byju's, which has raised over $5 billion to date, faced challenges in its attempt to go public in early 2022 and has been seeking new funding for over a year. The startup's efforts to raise funds were further complicated by the abrupt departure of the auditor Deloitte and three key board members. Subsequently, Byju's had to settle for a significantly smaller amount in debt funding and faced a technical default in a separate term loan.

In an attempt to raise funds, Byju's launched a rights issue, which was fully subscribed according to Raveendran. He urged existing investors to participate, emphasizing the importance of preserving and building greater value for all shareholders. However, this move has been met with resistance from a significant portion of the investor base.

Byju's has been a prominent player in the Indian edtech space, with a history of substantial investments and ambitious plans for growth. However, the recent events have cast a shadow on the company's leadership and financial management, leading to a significant rift between the founders and a substantial portion of the investor community.

The unfolding saga at Byju's reflects the complexities and challenges faced by high-profile startups in navigating financial management, governance, and investor relations. The clash between the leadership and a significant investor group underscores the critical importance of transparency, accountability, and effective communication in the startup ecosystem.

As the legal battle and leadership struggle at Byju's continue, the future of the edtech giant remains uncertain. The outcome of these developments will not only impact the company itself but also serve as a case study for the broader startup and investment landscape, highlighting the delicate balance between founder control and investor oversight.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/23/india-iphone-business-outpaces-individual-eu-countries-for-apple-morgan-stanley-says/,"Apple's India iPhone business outpaces individual EU countries, Morgan Stanley says","

Apple's long-term investment in India is starting to pay off, as the company's revenue in India increased by 42% in 2023, reaching $8.7 billion. This growth was driven by a 39% year-on-year increase in iPhone shipments, making India the fifth largest smartphone market for iPhones. In fact, India's iPhone business is now larger than any standalone country in the European Union. While India's market is not yet big enough to offset the declines in the Chinese market, if the current growth trajectory continues, India could surpass China as the biggest iPhone market by 2027.

The growth of iPhones in India can be attributed to increasing consumer demand for premium devices with higher storage capacity, rather than the latest models. In 2023, the average iPhone sold in India had around 260GB of memory, a 26% increase compared to the previous year. Additionally, India's iPhone average selling prices (ASPs) grew by 2% year-on-year to $940 in 2023.

According to data from research firm IDC, the top five iPhone models shipped in India were the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 15. These models accounted for 86% of total sales in the country. However, India's iPhone ASPs still trail the global average of $1,045 by around 10%.

Apple sees India as a major growth engine and has been making strategic moves to expand its presence in the country. In 2020, Apple opened its first two retail stores in India, signaling its commitment to the market. The company is also increasingly shifting its iPhone manufacturing to India. Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple's revenue in India will reach $40 billion by 2032.

In conclusion, Apple's long-term investment in India is starting to pay off, with significant revenue growth and increased iPhone shipments in the country. India's demand for premium devices with higher storage capacity has been a key driver of this growth. While India's market is not yet as large as China's, continued growth in India could make it the biggest iPhone market by 2027. Apple's focus on India as a major growth engine, including the opening of retail stores and increased manufacturing, further demonstrates its commitment to the Indian market.

The lunar surface has welcomed a new visitor, and this time it's not a government-led mission but a historic first for a private company. Intuitive Machines has achieved a remarkable feat by successfully landing its spacecraft, Odysseus, on the moon. The confirmation of the landing came at 5:23 p.m. CST, marking a significant milestone in space exploration history. Despite the spacecraft's exact condition being unclear, the mission director and Intuitive Machines CTO, Tim Crain, confirmed the successful transmission from the lunar surface, expressing optimism about the potential discoveries that lie ahead [[1]](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ranking-factors/spelling-grammar-ranking-factors/).

The landing of Odysseus was not without its challenges. The spacecraft's laser range finders, crucial for determining altitude and horizontal velocity, were broken. However, the team at Intuitive Machines ingeniously utilized NASA's laser and doppler lidar sensors onboard the spacecraft to guide it to a safe landing on the moon's surface, showcasing remarkable problem-solving and adaptability [[1]](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ranking-factors/spelling-grammar-ranking-factors/).

This achievement holds immense significance as it marks the first time in nearly 50 years that hardware from America has touched the lunar surface. The landing site, located just outside the rim of the Malapert-A crater, is the closest any lander has reached to the lunar south pole. This region has garnered substantial interest from both commercial entities and NASA, with plans for establishing a sustained human presence on the moon under the Artemis program. Intuitive Machines' successful landing has opened up new possibilities for further exploration and utilization of the moon's resources [[1]](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ranking-factors/spelling-grammar-ranking-factors/).

Intuitive Machines, based in Houston, has positioned itself as a pioneering company focused on providing services related to the moon.

 Reddit's Data Licensing Agreements and AI Vendors

Reddit, as it prepares for its stock market listing, has highlighted the importance of its data licensing agreements with AI vendors like OpenAI in its IPO prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These agreements involve licensing Reddit's vast amount of data, including over 1 billion posts and more than 16 billion comments, to train AI models.

The prospectus states that Reddit entered into data licensing arrangements in January 2024, with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years. It expects to recognize a minimum of $66.4 million in revenue during the year ending December 31, 2024, and beyond.

While the specific AI vendors licensing data from Reddit have not been disclosed, there have been reports suggesting that a ""large unnamed AI company,"" possibly Google, has entered into a licensing agreement worth about $60 million annually However, it wouldn't be surprising if OpenAI is also one of the customers, given that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has an 8.7% stake in Reddit and was previously a member of the company's board of directors.

 The Value of Reddit's Data for AI Models

Reddit's data is valuable for AI models because they ""learn"" from examples to generate various types of content, such as essays, code, emails, and articles. AI vendors like OpenAI scrape the web for millions to billions of examples to add to their training sets, and Reddit's vast corpus of conversational data and knowledge plays a significant role in training and improving large language models [[1]](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-assistant-its-limitations-or-failed-instructions/527310).

The prospectus highlights that Reddit's content, which refreshes and grows daily, provides real-time access to evolving and dynamic topics, making it valuable for training and updating AI models.

 Data Licensing Agreements and Content Producers

Data licensing agreements with AI vendors are becoming increasingly important for content producers, including stock media libraries and news publishers. These agreements allow them to access AI models' capabilities, such as chatbots, to generate content and provide services. This is particularly relevant as chatbots and AI-powered systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini threaten to reduce website traffic [[1]](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-assistant-its-limitations-or-failed-instructions/527310).

Content producers are turning to data licensing agreements to leverage AI models' abilities and save time and effort in content creation. By licensing data from platforms like Reddit, they can access a vast amount of conversational data and knowledge to train their AI models and improve their content generation capabilities.

 Licensing Agreements and Legal Considerations

AI vendors are pursuing licensing agreements as they face legal challenges regarding the use of data without permission or payment. Lawsuits have been filed against AI vendors, alleging that they have no legal justification for training their models on data without proper authorization.

OpenAI, for example, has faced accusations from The New York Times that it effectively built news publisher competitors using its works, which has had an impact on its business.

To address these legal concerns, AI vendors like OpenAI have entered into licensing agreements with various entities, including image gallery Shutterstock and publishers like Axel Springer. These agreements help ensure that the use of data is authorized and properly compensated.

The much-anticipated S-1 filing of social media giant Reddit has finally been submitted, marking the company's move towards a potential IPO. With a history marked by early acquisition and subsequent spin-off, Reddit now stands on the brink of entering the public markets, boasting a remarkable revenue surge from $666.7 million in 2022 to over $800 million in 2023.

Despite its impressive revenue growth, Reddit continues to grapple with profitability challenges, remaining unprofitable on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. The company's financials reveal a net loss of $158.6 million in 2022, which improved to $90.8 million in 2023. Similarly, the adjusted EBITDA figures also showed improvement, albeit remaining negative. The company's free cash flow, while showing signs of improvement, still ended in the negative territory.

One notable development is Reddit's reported net profit of $18.5 million in the final quarter of 2023, accompanied by a revenue peak of $249.8 million. However, the company's free cash flow remained negative during this period, ending at -$22 million.

In a surprising move, Reddit plans to reserve shares for 75,000 of its users, allowing them to purchase shares at the IPO price before the stock hits the public market. This departure from the traditional IPO process is a bold and unconventional step for the company.

Furthermore, Reddit's recent deal with Google, estimated at around $60 million per year, is expected to significantly bolster its 2024 results. This strategic partnership with Google, along with the potential for similar agreements with other major AI model providers, could pave the way for substantial revenue expansion, leveraging Reddit's role as a key data source for language models.

The company's user base growth is another compelling aspect, with a 27% increase in global daily active users in the last quarter of 2023. Reddit's ambitious plans for revenue growth through advertising, coupled with its early-stage utilization of machine learning and prediction models, position it for potential success in the advertising space.

Reddit's IPO, if successful, could have broader implications for the tech industry, potentially encouraging other late-stage private-market tech companies to consider entering the public market. This shift could inject new momentum into the venture capital landscape, benefiting both investors and the broader tech ecosystem.

In conclusion, Reddit's journey towards its IPO is marked by a mix of financial challenges, strategic innovations, and ambitious growth plans. The company's unique approach to its IPO and its strategic partnerships with major tech players set the stage for an intriguing and potentially transformative entry into the public markets.

Blue Origin, the aerospace company founded by Jeff Bezos, has raised a test version of its massive orbital rocket on its launch pad for the first time. This marks the beginning of a major test campaign leading up to the rocket's first launch later this year. The upcoming tests will allow the teams to practice vehicle integration, transportation to and from the launch pad, and conduct an integrated tanking test. Once the tests are complete, the vehicle will be returned to Blue Origin's garage at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Base for further preparations before its target launch date by the end of this year.

 Blue Origin's Test Campaign

The test version of the rocket consists of all Blue Origin hardware, but not all of it will be used in space. The second stage and the payload fairing are stand-ins during testing, and the rocket does not have any BE-4 engines, as they are not needed for the upcoming suite of tests. The BE-4 engines, which are also made by Blue Origin, are undergoing their own test campaign at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the company's facilities in West Texas.

The upcoming tests will serve several purposes. First, they will allow the teams to practice vehicle integration and transportation to and from the launch pad. This is an important step in ensuring that the rocket can be safely and efficiently prepared for launch. Additionally, the tests will include an integrated tanking test, where the booster will be fueled with liquid nitrogen to verify that the fluid systems function properly. It's worth noting that liquid nitrogen is not used during an actual launch.

Blue Origin CEO David Limp has stated that the tests are anticipated to take at least a week. Once the tests are complete, the vehicle will be returned to Blue Origin's garage at Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Base. There, engineers will outfit the reusable first stage with seven BE-4 engines and mate it with a flight-ready second stage. Limp expressed confidence that the vehicle will meet its target launch date by the end of this year, as manufacturing progress continues with multiple boosters, fairings, and second stages in their factory.

 Blue Origin's New Rocket: New Glenn

The new rocket being tested by Blue Origin is called New Glenn. It is the company's first heavy-lift rocket, designed to launch more than 45 tons of payload to low Earth orbit. Standing at 320 feet tall, New Glenn is considerably more powerful than Blue Origin's suborbital rocket, New Shepard, which is 60 feet tall and flies to around 66 miles above the Earth's surface. The reusable first stage of New Glenn is designed to land on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean, similar to SpaceX's booster recovery method. It is also designed to fly for at least 25 missions.

New Glenn has already attracted the attention of multiple customers. The first launch of New Glenn will carry a pair of NASA spacecraft called ESCAPADE, which are destined for Mars. Additionally, Amazon, Jeff Bezos' other company, has awarded New Glenn billions of dollars for up to 27 launches for its forthcoming Project Kuiper satellite internet constellation. Blue Origin has also secured launches for telecom providers Telecast and Eutelsat for later this decade.

 Conclusion

Blue Origin's test campaign for its New Glenn rocket is underway, with the recent raising of a test version of the rocket on its launch pad. The upcoming tests will allow the teams to practice vehicle integration, transportation, and conduct an integrated tanking test. Once the tests are complete, the vehicle will be returned to Blue Origin's garage for further preparations before its target launch date by the end of this year.
