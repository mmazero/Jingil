Revolutionizing Robotics: Energy-Efficient Actuators for the Future

Imagine robots that could run for days, perform complex tasks, and venture into dangerous environments without the limitations of battery life. Thanks to a groundbreaking invention from Stanford University researchers, this vision is becoming a reality.

The Problem with Electric Motors

Electric motors, the workhorses of robotics, have been designed for steady, continuous tasks. However, as robots take on more dynamic and complex roles, these motors struggle to keep up, wasting significant energy in the process.

A Spring-Loaded Solution

Stanford researchers have developed a new type of actuator, a device that uses energy to create motion, that addresses this energy inefficiency. Their actuator harnesses the power of springs, which can store and release energy without consuming any.

By engaging and disengaging these springs using innovative electroadhesive clutches, the actuator can assist the motor in lifting, lowering, and performing other tasks. This energy-saving mechanism allows the motor to operate at much higher efficiency levels.

Testing the Prototype

The researchers built a prototype actuator with six clutched springs and tested it against a standard electric motor. In every task, the augmented motor consumed at least 50% less power, with a peak reduction of 97%.

Benefits for Robotics and Beyond

More efficient motors mean robots can operate for longer periods, travel further distances, and perform more complex tasks. This has implications for assistive devices like prosthetics and exoskeletons, as well as for robots used in hazardous environments.

Future Developments

The researchers are working to optimize the actuator's controller to calculate the most efficient spring combinations even faster. They also envision a system that learns from past tasks, creating a database of efficient movements that can be applied to new challenges.

Commercial Potential

The technology is now ready for commercial translation, and the researchers are excited to bring it to market. They believe these energy-efficient actuators will revolutionize the future of robotics, enabling machines to perform more complex and demanding tasks with greater autonomy and efficiency.

In today's digital landscape, your brand is your most valuable asset. It embodies your identity, values, and mission. Protecting it from malicious actors is crucial for maintaining your reputation and financial stability. One common threat to brand security is domain name mimicking and traffic diversion.

Protecting Your Domain from Hackers

Domain hacking is a prevalent issue where competitors or unscrupulous individuals acquire similar or exact-match domain names with different extensions. This can redirect potential customers to their own websites, diluting your brand's traffic and reputation.

To prevent this, ensure you own all relevant extensions for your brand, not just the .com extension. Consult with legal counsel to safeguard your intellectual property and take swift action against any unauthorized use of your domain name.

Acquiring the .com Extension

If someone else owns the .com extension of your domain, consider purchasing it to secure your IP. In some cases, you may have legal grounds to challenge the ownership of the domain. Consult with an intellectual property attorney to explore your options.

Avoiding Hyphens and Alphanumeric Characters

Domains containing hyphens or alphanumeric characters can be more susceptible to exploitation. They are easier to replicate and can lead to confusion among visitors. Conduct a domain competitor audit to ensure your brand is capturing the majority of inbound traffic.

Keeping Your Domain Name Short

Shorter domain names are easier to remember, type, and rank well in search engines. Avoid using long, complex domain names that increase the risk of mistyping and traffic loss.

Locking Down Alternate Extensions

Similar-sounding domain names with different extensions, such as websites.com and websit.es, can create confusion and allow malicious actors to divert traffic. Secure all possible extensions for your brand to prevent this.

Choosing a Trusted Registrar

Select a reputable domain registrar located in your own country. Avoid foreign hosting, as it may expose you to different laws and regulations that could complicate legal disputes.

Consulting Domain Experts

Protect your brand by consulting with domain experts. They can guide you on proactive measures such as stealth acquisition, ensuring you secure the most valuable domain name for your business and mitigate future risks.

Conclusion

Protecting your brand's domain name is essential for maintaining its integrity and value. By following these best practices, you can safeguard your IP, prevent traffic diversion, and ensure your brand's dominance in the digital realm. Remember, your domain is a cornerstone of your brand's identity, and it deserves the utmost protection.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/crypto-exchange-okx-ceases-services-in-india/,Crypto exchange OKX ceases services in India, OKX Withdraws from India Amidst Government Crackdown ,"

OKX Withdraws from India: What's the Story?

In a recent blow to the Indian crypto community, OKX, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its decision to cease operations in the country. This move comes after Apple and Google removed the OKX app from their Indian app stores, following a warning from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

Government Crackdown on Illegal Crypto Exchanges

The FIU, an Indian government agency, has been cracking down on crypto exchanges operating illegally within the country. While the agency specifically named Binance, Kraken, Huobi, and Gate.io as non-compliant, OKX was not initially mentioned. However, the exchange has now decided to withdraw from India, citing ""local regulations.""

Impact on Indian Crypto Traders

OKX has instructed its Indian customers to close all open positions and withdraw their funds by April 30th. This decision has left many traders in a bind, as they are now faced with the challenge of finding a new platform to trade their crypto assets.

Reasons for OKX's Withdrawal

The exact reasons behind OKX's withdrawal from India are not entirely clear. However, it is likely that the exchange's decision is related to the government's increased scrutiny of cryptocurrencies and its efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.

Taxation and Regulation

India has taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, bringing them under the ambit of anti-money laundering and counterterrorism regulations in 2022. The government has also imposed a 30% tax on crypto gains and a 1% deduction on each transaction.

Global Platforms vs. Local Exchanges

While Indian-based crypto exchanges have been compliant with the government's regulations, many global platforms have not. This has led some traders to flock to these international exchanges in an attempt to avoid paying taxes. However, the government's crackdown is making it increasingly difficult for these traders to operate.

Conclusion

OKX's withdrawal from India is a significant development in the country's crypto landscape. It highlights the government's determination to regulate the industry and ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how India will balance the need for regulation with the potential benefits of cryptocurrency adoption.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/meta-privacy-fee-eu-assessment/,EU signals doubts over legality of Meta's privacy fee," EU Condemns Meta's ""Pay or Track"" Privacy Fee ","

The EU's Crackdown on Meta's ""Pay or Track"" Tactic

The European Union (EU) has taken a firm stance against Meta's controversial ""pay or track"" policy, which forces users to choose between paying a monthly subscription or agreeing to data tracking on Facebook and Instagram. This move signals a significant shift in the EU's approach to digital governance and competition.

EU's Concerns

Margrethe Vestager, the EU's digital chief, has expressed doubts about Meta's privacy fee, stating that there are alternative ways to monetize online services. She emphasized the importance of contextual advertising, which shows ads based on the content a user is viewing rather than their personal data.

The EU is also concerned that Meta's paywall may discourage users from using the benefits of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies. Vestager has stated that the EU will investigate any attempts by gatekeepers (companies with significant market power) to use economic coercion to circumvent the DMA.

Meta's Obligations

Meta is subject to both the DMA and the Digital Services Act (DSA), which require platforms to obtain consent for processing data for advertising purposes. However, Meta has been accused of using unfair tactics and economic coercion to force users to hand over their data.

The EU has sent a formal request for information to Meta regarding its compliance with the DSA. The Commission is assessing whether Meta is meeting its obligations, particularly concerning transparency and potential risks related to the subscription option.

Protecting Minors

The EU has highlighted that targeted advertising is prohibited for minors. Meta has claimed that it does not offer the paywall to minors, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of age verification on Facebook and Instagram. If minors are being served the paywall and agreeing to data tracking, it would constitute a clear breach of the DSA.

Enforcement and Penalties

The EU has not yet indicated a timeline for enforcement actions, but it has emphasized that it will not hesitate to use its full toolbox to ensure compliance with the DMA. Confirmed breaches of the DMA can result in penalties of up to 10% of global annual turnover.

Consumer Protection

Consumer protection groups have filed complaints against Meta's privacy fee, arguing that it violates EU consumer protection and privacy laws. They contend that Meta's pricing is disproportionate to the value it derives from user data and that the paywall prevents users from making a free choice.

Meta's Response

Meta maintains that its paywall complies with EU laws. However, it has reportedly offered to lower the cost of its ad-free subscription in discussions with privacy regulators. Privacy rights groups remain critical, arguing that the mechanism itself is problematic as it does not allow users to exercise their right to make a free choice.

The EU's stance on Meta's paywall sends a clear message that Big Tech companies must abide by the spirit and letter of digital governance laws. The EU is committed to protecting user privacy, promoting fair competition, and ensuring that consumers have a genuine choice in how their data is used.

Glassdoor's Anonymity Breach: Users' Concerns Raised

Glassdoor, the popular platform for anonymous company reviews, has come under fire for allegedly collecting and adding users' real names to their profiles without their consent.

Monica's Story Raises Alarm

One user, Monica, shared her experience on her personal blog. She claims that Glassdoor added her name and city to her profile after an email exchange with customer support, despite never providing this information during sign-up. Monica believes Glassdoor obtained her name from the email's ""from"" line.

Despite Monica's protests, Glassdoor insisted that her name was ""required"" on her profile, claiming it wouldn't compromise her anonymity for past reviews. However, Monica expressed concerns about potential data breaches or legal demands that could expose her identity.

Users Express Fear

Monica's story has sparked alarm among Glassdoor users, who fear that their anonymity could be compromised. They worry that data collected about them could be added to their profiles without their knowledge.

Glassdoor's History of Anonymity

Glassdoor has traditionally allowed users to sign up anonymously. However, after acquiring Fishbowl, a semi-anonymous social network, Glassdoor required all users to verify their identities.

Aaron Mackey, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concerns that Glassdoor's new policies could undermine its commitment to user anonymity. He noted that Glassdoor has previously defended users' anonymity in court.

Data Collection Raises Questions

In some cases, the data added to users' profiles was inaccurate. Josh Simmons, another Glassdoor user, described it as a ""breach of trust."" He believes Glassdoor may have scraped his data from a data broker.

Glassdoor has not provided clear answers regarding how it verifies the accuracy of the information it collects or how it can be used.

Users' Dilemma

Monica's experience has left Glassdoor users with a dilemma. They can either accept having their names on their profiles or delete their accounts. Monica chose to delete hers.

Conclusion

Glassdoor's alleged data collection practices have raised serious concerns about user anonymity. While Glassdoor claims to protect user privacy, its recent actions have left many questioning the platform's commitment to this principle. Users should carefully consider the risks associated with providing personal information to Glassdoor and weigh the potential consequences before signing up or continuing to use the platform.
