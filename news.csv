Midas, a leading Turkish fintech firm, secures $45M Series A led by Portage. Plans include crypto trading, mutual funds, savings accounts, and regional expansion into the MENA region.","[INTRODUCTION]

Midas, a trailblazing fintech startup based in Turkey, recently secured $45 million in funding. This Series A round was headed by Portage, a prominent Canadian investor. With over 2 million users, Midas enables individuals in Turkey to access both US and Turkish equity markets. By offering reduced transaction and commission fees, coupled with educational resources such as financial content, real-time data, and company profiles, Midas stands out as a valuable resource for those navigating these emerging markets. In this article, we delve deeper into Midas' successful journey and future aspirations.

[THE EMERGENCE AND GROWTH OF MIDAS]

Historically, Turkey's retail investor market witnessed limited engagement due to insufficient infrastructure support. However, Midas seized the opportunity to revolutionize the industry by constructing tailored infrastructure solutions and focusing on enhancing user experiences. Founder and CEO Egem Eraslan proudly shared, ""We achieved significant growth using minimal investments—less than $500,000—to initiate, gain traction, secure additional capital, and establish ourselves as key players.""

Midas' innovative approach mirrors that of U.S.-based Robinhood, yet their strategies diverge given Turkey's unique demands. While Robinhood operates without concerns about self-custody and clearing services, Midas addresses these needs independently across various product offerings. As Eraslan explained, ""Our expansion strategy involved introducing numerous products while handling our own self-clearing, custody, and delivering end-to-end value chains.""

[NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND REGIONAL EXPANSION PLANS]

Following this substantial financing milestone, Midas reveals plans to introduce three novel features – cryptocurrency trading, mutual funds, and savings accounts. Furthermore, they aim to broaden their reach by venturing beyond Turkey and setting sights on nations within the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region.

This strategic move comes after previously raising $11 million during a seed round back in 2022. Marking another remarkable achievement, Midas' current funding event ranks among the most considerable sums attained by Turkish fintech companies in recent times.

[SUPPORTIVE INVESTORS FUELING THE JOURNEY]

Earlybird Digital East Fund, International Finance Corporation, Spark Capital, and Revo Capital joined forces alongside Portage in backing Midas' visionary initiatives. Cem Sertoglu, Managing Partner of Earlybird Digital East Fund, acknowledged the startups' extraordinary achievements thus far. He stated, ""By accurately anticipating explosive demand in the Turkish investment sector, Midas executed impeccably and captured the burgeoning local market."" Moreover, he highlighted the team's global ambitions extending well beyond Turkey's borders.

Paul Desmarais III, Co-Founder of Portage and CEO and Chairman of Sagard, expressed confidence in Midas' capacity to spearhead large-scale changes throughout Turkey's financial ecosystem. On a broader scale, he mentioned Portage's commitment to empowering transformative financial technologies worldwide, particularly in regions characterized by earl adopters like Turkey.

[CONCLUSION]

With impressive momentum propelling them forward, Midas demonstrates immense potential to reshape the financial landscapes of Turkey and beyond. Their focus on innovating robust and accessible platforms addressing diverse investment opportunities bolsters their appeal amongst millions of users. Given the overwhelming support received from esteemed investors, Midas continues to fortify its position in the competitive realm of fintech.

Introduction

With over 830 million internet users, India is grappling with a rising tide of misinformation as it commences the world's most extensive democratic exercise – its general election taking place between April 19 and June 1, 2023. This article explores the escalating challenge posed by misinformation, focusing on cheapfakes, deepfakes, and the unique linguistic and cultural hurdles facing fact-checkers in this diverse nation. We will discuss potential solutions and delve into what major technology players like Google and Meta are doing—or failing to do—to help combat this issue.

The Reality of Misinformation in Modern India

According to the World Economic Forum, India ranks high in terms of vulnerability to misinformation and disinformation; thus, it comes as no surprise that the upcoming elections have seen rampant spreading of false information capable of affecting both election fairness and causing real-world harm. With deadly consequences ranging from inciting violence to fueling discrimination towards minority groups, tackling misinformation is vital.

Deepfakes and Cheapfakes: New Threats Emerge

Artificial intelligence (AI) has exacerbated the misinformation crisis via deepfakes—hyper-realistic fabrications produced using generative AI. Additionally, another phenomenon called 'cheapfakes' plagues India. Hamsini Hariharan, a specialist at the U.K.-based fact-checking firm Logically, explains cheapfakes as content altered utilizing relatively unsophisticated techniques such as modifying images, videos, and audio files. These deceitful materials then find eager audiences on various social media platforms.

A Call for Accountability

Recently, eleven civil society organizations in India, including digital rights groups Internet Freedom Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC.in), petitioned the Indian Election Commission to ensure political leaders and social media platforms face consequences for any misconduct involving misinformation.

The Increase in Scale and Sophistication of Misinformation

Since India's previous general election in 2019, misinformation and disinformation tactics have evolved significantly due primarily to increased internet access reaching nearly 50%, up from only 14%. Another contributing factor is the emergence of tools enabling individuals to manipulate visual and auditory content easily. According to Hariharan, one notable example involves casting doubts regarding Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Numerous instances include repurposing old video clips and texts without proper context, allegedly claiming that EVMs have been prohibited, malfunctioning, or tampered with, accompanied by related hashtags like BanEVM.

Addressing Social Media Companies' Role

Alt News co-founder Pratik Sinha criticizes social media giants for falling short when addressing misleading material disseminated on their respective platforms. Although firms like Google and Meta claim efforts to minimize misleading content during the Indian elections, neither company has introduced substantial product modifications nor implemented decisive action against fake news. In fact, reports suggest that shortly before the Indian election, Meta reduced financial support for several news agencies involved in fact-checking activities on WhatsApp.

Conclusion

To protect India's electoral integrity and preserve societal harmony, combatting misinformation necessitates concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders. Governments must establish effective policies while ensuring freedom of expression remains intact. Technology corporations must shoulder responsibility by actively investing resources in countermeasures and creating robust reporting mechanisms for flagging questionable content. Simultaneously, cultivating critical thinking skills amongst netizens becomes crucial for enhancing overall media literacy levels, thereby rendering them better equipped to discern reliable sources from dubious ones. By fostering collaboration and commitment from all parties concerned, we stand a fighting chance against battling misinformation in today's digitally connected era.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/india-election-2024-getty.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-20 12:00:27,"""Combat misinformation in India's elections: Urge action from tech firms & boost media literacy. ElectionIntegrity FightFakeNews""","Digital Fake News Battle in India's Elections

As India gears up for its massive general election, the country faces an unprecedented surge of misinformation, particularly through deepfakes and cheapfakes. Concerned organizations have urged the Election Commission to hold politicians and social media platforms accountable for promoting misleading content. Since the last election in 2019, misinformation tactics have become more sophisticated, exploiting expanded internet access and easy-to-use content manipulation tools. Critics accuse tech companies like Google and Meta of insufficient actions against fake news, despite claims of minimizing misleading content during Indian elections. To safeguard electoral integrity and foster social harmony, governments, tech firms, and citizens must collaborate in combating misinformation through policy development, resource investment, and enhanced media literacy.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/20/fisa-nsa-fbi-government-surveillance/,Lawmakers vote to reauthorize US spying law that critics say expands government surveillance,"Title: US Surveillance Law Reauthorized: Expanded Government Surveillance Debated 

(50 characters)","Title: The Controversial Reauthorization of the US Surveillance Law: A Deep Dive

Introduction

In the early hours of Saturday, lawmakers passed a highly debated legislation to reauthorize and expand the United States' surveillance law, dismissing concerns raised by privacy advocates and numerous congressional representatives. This article delves into the intricacies of this new bill, analyzing its implications and the heated debate surrounding it.

Understanding the Revised Surveillance Law

The approved bill extends the life of Section 702 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This section permits the federal government to intercept and analyze communication between foreign entities suspected of espionage or terrorism activities via American technology and telecommunication platforms. However, opponents argue that the scope of FISA often ensnares communications belonging to innocent Americans without proper judicial oversight.

Government agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and National Security Agency (NSA) can search through collected data without obtaining a warrant for individual Americans' communications due to the current provisions of the act. Alleged misuse of power has been leveled against both organizations regarding indiscriminate searches of citizens' private correspondences.

Reactions to the Bill

Top White House officials and intelligence authorities supported the extension of FISA, asserting that such measures protect national security interests by thwarting potential terrorist acts and cyber threats. They further emphasized the importance of Section 702 in providing critical intel presented during presidential daily briefings.

However, civil liberties proponents criticize the lack of transparency and insufficient safeguards against possible abuse. Privacy activists called for stricter regulations requiring warrants before scouring the Section 702 repository for American citizen data. Bipartisan negotiations pushing for mandatory warrants ultimately fell short ahead of the decisive Senate vote.

Key Players & Statements

Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, defended the decision to reapprove FISA despite acknowledging its flaws. He mentioned that the statute plays a crucial role in maintaining America's intelligence capabilities.

On the other side of the argument, Senator Ron Wyden—a prominent Democrat and staunch advocate for digital rights—accused fellow senators of hastily passing the revamped surveillance bill without sufficient consideration. In his view, Congress had waited too long to address glaring problems associated with unrestricted electronic snooping, effectively jeopardizing people's Fourth Amendment constitutional rights.

Historical Context & Future Implications

Originating in 1978, pre-dating the dawn of the contemporary Internet age, FISA gained widespread attention following Edward Snowden's disclosures in 2013. These revelations highlighted extensive international spying operations conducted under FISA, involving multiple major US tech corporations acting as involuntary accomplices.

Although many anticipated swift approval of the surveillance bill, recent controversy emerged when the House greenlighted an altered version. This updated legislation threatened expansion of FISA coverage to encompass additional businesses outside those currently bound by the statute. Despite strong industry pushback, an attempt led by Senator Wyden to strike down the proposed change proved unsuccessful.

Interestingly, FISA contains a clause preventing sudden cessation of surveillance initiatives even if there's a temporary gap in authorized powers. Consequently, the government may utilize existing certifications granted by the clandestine FISA court until April 2025. With the latest revision extending FISA's lifespan till the end of 2026, another round of intense legislative bargaining seems inevitable halfway through the subsequent US presidency.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fisa-government-senate-reauthorization.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-20 13:00:44,"""Explore the renewal of US surveillance law, expanding gov't powers until 2026.

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), staying informed about the latest developments is crucial. This roundup features a selection of recent stories and notable research in the realm of machine learning, along with a closer look at the concept of 'open source' in AI.

Meta's Llama 3 AI Models: The Reality of 'Open Source'

Meta recently introduced Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B, the latest iterations of its generative AI models. Described as ""open sourced"" by Meta, these models are designed to analyze and generate text. However, the term 'open source' may not accurately represent the situation. Meta has imposed licensing restrictions on Llama 3, such as limiting model usage for training other models and requiring special licenses for developers with over 700 million monthly users.

The Carnegie Mellon study, co-authored by researchers at Carnegie Mellon, the AI Now Institute, and the Signal Foundation, highlights the discrepancies between the perception and reality of 'open source' AI models. Many so-called 'open source' models, including Llama, come with restrictions and limitations that hinder their accessibility and usefulness for developers.

The Challenges of Defining 'Open Source' in AI

Defining 'open source' in the context of AI poses unique challenges. The foundational IP mechanism for open source licensing, copyright, is difficult to apply to AI components like model embeddings. Additionally, the open source ethos of unrestricted code access and modification does not align well with AI, which requires specific ingredients for study and modification.

The Impact of 'Open Source' AI Models from Tech Giants

When tech giants like Meta release 'open source' AI models, they often reap the benefits in terms of marketing, technical advantages, and strategic positioning. However, the open source community may not experience the same level of benefits. Instead, these centralized 'open source' projects can entrench and expand the power of big tech companies.

Introduction

Rumors about Salesforce's interest in acquiring legacy data management firm Informatica sparked controversy among investors earlier this month. With Salesforce's stock prices plunging and Informatica investors demanding better returns, we delve deeper into the implications of such a merger and whether it makes strategic and financial sense. This article explores the background of both companies, their history of acquisitions, market dynamics, expert opinions, and the impact on stakeholders.

Background & Acquisition History

Founded in 1999, Salesforce has completed 74 acquisitions, including 13 in 2020—the largest being the $28 billion Slack Technologies deal. Post-Slack, however, Salesforce slowed down its acquisition spree, focusing instead on improving profitability and generating positive free cash flows. Activist investors pressured Salesforce into embracing profitability following declines in sales growth and rising interest rates. As part of its efforts to fend off activists, Salesforce conducted massive layoffs and dissolved its internal M&A committee responsible for identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions.

On the other hand, Informatica—a pre-cloud data management company founded in the '90s—witnessed resistance from its investors upon hearing about the proposed acquisition. They believed that Salesforce undervalued Informatica, leading to a drop in Informatica's stock value.

Reasons Behind the Rumored Merger

With Salesforce anticipating single-digit growth in the upcoming fiscal year, the company may view acquiring Informatica as an opportunity to gain additional revenue streams and improve its overall performance metrics. Additionally, purchasing a data management platform during the rise of generative AI addresses increasing demands for organized and accessible data across various industries.

Expert Opinions

Experts hold mixed views regarding the merits of the potential acquisition. According to Ray Wang, Founder and Principal Analyst at Constellation Research, Salesforce's existing data integration tools offer superior functionality compared to Informatica's technology. However, others argue that investing in infrastructure now sets the stage for further development of applications and copilots later.

Financial Perspective

Despite Salesforce's impressive growth rate of 11%, projections indicate that the company's revenues will experience slower growth, reaching only single digits in the near future. Meanwhile, Informatica generated free cash flows of approximately $216 million in FY 2022, suggesting stability and profitability despite its relatively small size.

Conclusion

While experts remain divided on the benefits of combining forces, one thing remains certain: Investors need clarity regarding Salesforce's vision for growth. Whether this comes via organic expansion, strategic partnerships, or targeted acquisitions, transparency is key to maintaining trust and confidence in the organization. By addressing questions surrounding the rationale behind pursuing Informatica, Salesforce can alleviate concerns while positioning itself competitively in today's rapidly changing technological landscape.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1934156363.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-19 17:09:07,"Meta Description:

At the Core of Innovation: Active-Phased Array Systems

Founded in 2017, CesiumAstro specializes in creating sophisticated radio technology designed for use in various applications such as satellite communications, radar, and electronic warfare systems. Although phased-array antennas have long been utilized in satellite technology, CesiumAstro distinguishes itself through significant advancements and commercialization of the technology. Backed by substantial investments—over $100 million in venture capital and government funding—the company offers a range of solutions tailored to meet the needs of commercial and military clients alike.

Emergence of a New Competitor: AnySignal

In October 2022, another player entered the competitive landscape when El Segundo-based AnySignal made its public debut after being quietly formed in May of the same year. With $5 million in seed money and a focus on developing a software-defined radio platform, AnySignal quickly garnered industry attention. Moreover, news broke earlier this year confirming a strategic collaboration between AnySignal and Vast, a private space station builder, further solidifying its presence in the marketplace.

Allegations Against Former Executive

Amidst this backdrop, CesiumAstro took action against Erik Luther, their ex-Vice President of Products, accusing him of betraying his duties by divulging confidential information related to investors and customers to AnySignal. Despite leaving CesiumAstro to assume a leadership role in a different industry, the complaint posits that Luther leveraged personal relationships established during previous employment stints to facilitate the illicit transfer of intellectual property.

Legal Implications and Rebuttals

Naturally, CesiumAstro seeks restitution via legal means. The company insists that AnySignal's rapid ascension can be traced back to the purloined data, enabling the upstart to sidestep years of research and development expenses otherwise required to build a comparable portfolio.

However, Luther vehemently disputes the allegations, arguing that there exists no concrete proof supporting collusion between himself and AnySignal. His attorney contends that Cesium Astro fails to produce credible evidence substantiating the egregious breach of trust implied by the plaintiff.

Conclusion

As litigation progresses, industries observing this high-profile clash await outcomes eagerly. Regardless of whether the courts rule in favor of CesiumAstro or dismiss the charges, lessons learned will undoubtedly influence future strategies employed by businesses navigating similarly precarious situations involving proprietary knowledge protection.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cesiumastro.png?resize=1200,803",2024-04-19 21:57:12,Discover the intensifying startup rivalry between CesiumAstro and AnySignal!

Introduction

Vector databases are gaining significant traction in the current tech landscape, with a surge in startups and investor interest. This growth can be attributed to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and the generative AI (GenAI) movement, which have created an environment conducive to the flourishing of vector database technologies. Traditional relational databases, such as Postgres or MySQL, are designed for structured data with predefined data types. However, unstructured data like images, videos, emails, and social media posts require a different approach due to their lack of adherence to a predefined data model.

The Vector Database Solution

Vector databases store and process data in the form of vector embeddings, converting text, documents, images, and other data into numerical representations. These representations capture the meaning and relationships between different data points, making them ideal for machine learning applications. In vector databases, data is stored spatially based on its relevance to other items, facilitating the retrieval of semantically similar data.

For LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4, vector search enhances context understanding by analyzing previous similar conversations. This technology is also beneficial for real-time applications, such as content recommendations in social networks or e-commerce apps, as it can quickly retrieve similar items based on user search history. Additionally, vector search can help reduce ""hallucinations"" in LLM applications by providing supplementary information that might not have been available in the original training dataset.

The Growing Market and Investments

Several vector database startups have recently secured substantial funding, including Qdrant, Vespa, Weaviate, Pinecone, and Chroma. These companies raised a combined total of $200 million in 2022, demonstrating the growing interest in vector database technologies. Furthermore, Index Ventures recently led a $9.5 million seed round into Superlinked, a platform that transforms complex data into vector embeddings.

Intro

A new wave of investment has hit the vector database sector, with several startups raising over $200 million in 2022 alone. This trend highlights the increasing importance of managing vast amounts of unstructured data efficiently. Unlike traditional relational databases, vector databases specialize in storing and processing vectors—numerical representations capturing the meaning and relationships among various data elements.

Investors Bet Big on Vector Databases

Qdrant, Vespa, Weaviate, Pinecone, and Chroma are just some of the vector database startups attracting significant investments this year. With these funds, they aim to refine their technologies further and address specific challenges associated with handling massive volumes of unstructured data. For instance, Superlinked recently received $9.5 million in seed money from Index Ventures, allowing them to create vector embeddings out of intricate datasets.

Advanced Applications

Vector databases serve numerous advanced purposes, particularly benefiting large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's GPT-4. By incorporating vector search capabilities, developers enhance LLMs' ability to grasp context through examining prior pertinent interactions. Moreover, vector search contributes significantly to real-time use cases, such as personalized content suggestions in social platforms or online marketplaces, thanks to speedy retrieval of comparable records according to users' past actions.

Moreover, vector search plays a vital role in reducing hallucinations in LLM implementations by presenting additional relevant details initially absent from the underlying training materials. Consequently, the expanding prominence of vector databases reflects both the evolving nature of artificial intelligence and the necessity for adaptable storage solutions tailored specifically for today's diverse and ever-growing pool of digital assets.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
