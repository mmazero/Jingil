https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen has the potential to drive the wider adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, according to a recent study conducted by Cornell University. The study, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" highlights the significant carbon emissions associated with current cryptocurrency operations and proposes leveraging the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency to support a sustainable and climate-friendly future.

Professor Fengqi You, an expert in energy systems engineering at Cornell, emphasizes the need to explore opportunities for harnessing the widespread interest in cryptocurrency. By linking energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen technology, which the researchers refer to as the ""dynamic duo,"" renewable energy sectors can be bolstered.

Apoorv Lal, a doctoral student and co-author of the study, explains that establishing a green hydrogen infrastructure to facilitate cryptocurrency production can accelerate the growth of renewable energy and contribute to a more sustainable energy landscape. By utilizing clean energy sources to power blockchain mining operations and produce green hydrogen, the capacity for wind and solar energy can be expanded, leading to increased sustainable energy production nationwide.

The current structure of blockchain-based cryptocurrency mining in the United States consumes as much carbon-based energy as the entire country of Argentina, according to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology. The vast majority of domestic crypto-mining electricity relies on energy-intensive consensus mechanisms known as ""proof of work,"" which are used to verify crypto-assets. Preliminary estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest that cryptocurrency mining accounts for between 0.6% and 2.3% of all U.S. electricity consumption in 2023.

Acknowledging the substantial energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, the researchers propose an innovative solution that leverages cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers in conjunction with green hydrogen. This combination transforms the environmental challenge posed by cryptocurrency mining into a powerful force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

In their study, You and Lal analyzed individual U.S. states to identify their energy strengths and assess their potential. Supporting cryptocurrency mining can accelerate the development of additional energy infrastructure. For example, in New Mexico, each Bitcoin mined could potentially generate 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power, while in Wyoming, it could produce 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power.

You emphasizes that cryptocurrency, like energy, is intangible and can be likened to a gift card. Cryptocurrency holds not only monetary but also energy value, making it a versatile tool for promoting sustainable practices.

To advance a sustainable future for blockchain-based cryptocurrency, the researchers stress the need for stronger federal policies that prioritize climate goals and renewable energy. By combining cryptocurrency with green hydrogen, this approach not only mitigates the environmental impact of cryptocurrency but also pioneers a sustainable path for the transition to renewable energy.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/nasas-snake-robot-is-designed-to-search-out-life-in-the-icy-oceans-of-a-saturn-moon/,NASAâ€™s snake robot is designed to search out life in the icy oceans of a Saturn moon,"The snake robot form factor has been around for many years, and it offers several practical advantages in the world of automation. One of these advantages is redundancy, which means that the system can continue to function even if one module is damaged. Another advantage is its flexible body, which allows it to navigate through tight spaces.

These characteristics make snake robots a valuable addition to search-and-rescue teams, as they can access areas that are inaccessible to humans and other robots. They can also be used in applications such as plumbing and medicine. In the medical field, smaller versions of snake robots can navigate through pipes and even human organs. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has been exploring the use of snake robots to search for extraterrestrial life.

However, it is important to note that we are still in the early stages of this technology. Testing is currently being done on Earth to simulate the conditions that these robots may encounter in space. This involves a lot of ice, as NASA plans to send the snake robot to Enceladus, a moon of Saturn known for its water-rich environment.

Enceladus is considered a potential candidate for life in our solar system. The goal is to use the snake robot, called Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS), to explore the oceans beneath the moon's surface and find answers to some of the universe's biggest questions.

The team behind this research explains that EELS is designed to navigate various types of terrain, including fluidized media, enclosed environments, and liquids. The design of the robot is mainly driven by the unique conditions of Enceladus. Glaciers on Earth have been used as analogs to develop and test the robot's architecture before its journey to Enceladus.

To carry out this project, JPL has partnered with Arizona State University, the University of California, San Diego, and Carnegie Mellon University. Carnegie Mellon University has a history of designing snake robots, and its spinout company HEBI Robotics has developed the modules used in the early version of EELS.

On Enceladus, EELS will be able to navigate narrow geysers on the surface and swim through the moon's vast global ocean, which is estimated to be six miles deep at the south pole. The robot is equipped with advanced planning, situational awareness, motion planning, and proprioceptive control to enable autonomous movement far away from Earth.

According to NASA, the snake robot weighs 100,000 grams and measures 4.4 meters in length. This technology holds great promise for future space exploration and the search for life beyond our planet.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2_EELS_Athabasca_2023.width-1320.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-26 20:53:37,Innovation,Innovation
