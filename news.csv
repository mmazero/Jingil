Blog Post:

Imagine a world where climbing robots can complete maintenance tasks on tall structures, deliver parcels to high-rise buildings, or even save lives by providing survival kits in hard-to-reach places. While these possibilities may seem like science fiction, researchers worldwide are working tirelessly to make them a reality. A crucial challenge in this quest for real-world deployment of climbing robots is enabling them to accurately sense and map their surroundings while predicting their location within these mapped environments.

A team of researchers from Guangdong University of Technology has recently proposed a new method to enhance a biped climbing robot's ability to estimate its state and map its surroundings while climbing a truss structure. Their proposed method, introduced in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, is based on a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, specifically designed for a biped climbing robot (BiCR) developed by their lab, the Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab.

Biped Climbing Robot (BiCR)
The BiCR is an electromechanical system with grippers at both ends and multiple joints, allowing it to move and rotate. It can be employed for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and high-risk environments, such as construction site scaffolding and power towers. The researchers' primary objective was to enable the BiCR to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures.

BiCR-SLAM: A Customized SLAM Approach
To achieve this, the team developed BiCR-SLAM, a SLAM system that combines information about the BiCR robot's configuration, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras. BiCR-SLAM determines the pose of the robotic gripper and creates a map of poles surrounding the gripper, enabling it to plan its actions more effectively while climbing a truss.

The framework consists of four components: encoder dead reckoning, LiDAR odometry estimation, pole landmark mapping, and global optimization. The global optimization proposes a multi-source fusion factor graph to jointly optimize the robot localization and pole landmarks.

Introduction

The quest for clean and sustainable energy sources has led to the rise of green hydrogen, a promising future energy carrier. Among the renewable energy options, solar energy holds an advantage due to its ubiquity and minimal dependence on natural topography. However, fluctuations in solar output pose a significant challenge to the components of solar-powered hydrogen production devices. To address this issue, Dr. Bora Seo's research team from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has developed a cutting-edge durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices. This new method, utilizing actual solar irradiance data with step durations as short as one second, simulates solar energy output fluctuations more accurately than ever before.

The Importance of Durability Evaluation

Existing durability evaluation methods have not adequately reflected solar output variability, relying solely on periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Moreover, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions. Dr. Seo's research team has developed a simulation method that converts irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data and water electrolysis stack data. This breakthrough has dramatically shortened the step duration from 10 seconds to 1 second, enabling fluctuations in solar output to be accurately reflected.

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity, transitioning from a niche product to a mainstream favorite during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become popular choices for enthusiasts, offering a wide array of layouts and customizable parts. However, the market has become somewhat stagnant, as features once exclusive to high-end keyboards are now commonplace in budget models. RGB lighting, various switch types, and gasket-mounted designs have become the norm. Despite the increased accessibility and quality of mechanical keyboards, the market could benefit from a fresh, innovative concept. Enter magnetic switches.

Magnetic switches, a new addition to the mechanical keyboard world, offer the ability to quickly change the actuation point, the point at which a keypress registers. Traditional mechanical switches rely on closing an electrical circuit to register a keystroke. As a user presses down, the stem's legs push against metal leaves, completing the circuit. Different stems and springs create diverse switch sensations, including linear, tactile, and clicky switches. However, magnetic switches use a unique mechanism to activate keystrokes.

Magnetic switches, popularized by Wooting, a Dutch keyboard startup, rely on the Hall Effect. These switches function similarly to mechanical switches, with stems and springs, but lack the electrical circuit and stem legs. Instead, a permanent magnet is located in the stem, which a keyboard's PCB sensor detects as the user presses down. This design enables a key innovation: adjusting the actuation point.

The ability to change the actuation point offers various benefits, particularly for gamers. When gaming, users may prefer a 0.1-millimeter actuation point for quick responses, while typing requires a 2.5-millimeter actuation point to minimize errors. Magnetic switches allow for simple adjustments through keyboard shortcuts or manufacturer software, and often include temperature calibration options to ensure precision.

Another advantage of magnetic switches is the ability to change not only the actuation point but also the release point. This feature is particularly beneficial for gaming, as it allows for rapid triggering and customization. Users can even create macros, assigning multiple actions to a single key for","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4330.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-07 16:30:40,"Discover magnetic switches: Revolutionize your mechanical keyboard experience!

Nonlinear systems are prevalent in various fields, from robotics to economics. However, their inherent complexity makes mathematical modeling and control challenging. To tackle this issue, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system has emerged as a powerful tool, approximating nonlinear systems as multiple linear systems using fuzzy logic. In recent years, the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS), an enhanced version of the T–S fuzzy system, has gained traction, offering a robust space-state representation of physical systems.

The T–S fuzzy system has laid the groundwork for several nonlinear control methods, with the Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC) method being the most prominent. Despite extensive research, optimal control strategies in the context of T–S FDSs remain largely unexplored, particularly in the realm of robust control methods, which shield systems from disturbances. One such method is the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), which, while effective, introduces additional complexity and optimization challenges.

A team of researchers, led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from Shibaura Institute of Technology and including Thi-Van-Anh Nguyen, Quy-Thinh Dao, and Duc-Binh Pham from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, aimed to address these limitations. They developed novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model. Their study was published in Scientific Reports.

The researchers first established stability conditions for the FDS mathematical model using the Lyapunov stability theory. However, these conditions were not directly usable. By transforming them into LMI, the team created a more solvable foundation for developing three controllers: stability, optimal, and robust-optimal.

The stability controller, utilizing PDC, manages deviations, while the optimal controller minimizes a cost function to achieve optimal control. The robust-optimal controller combines the benefits of both, offering increased adaptability in practical scenarios.

To demonstrate the controllers' effectiveness, the team tested them on a rotary inverted pendulum, a challenging system with an inverted pendulum on a rot",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-robust-optimal-c.jpg,2024-04-08 11:32:04,"Optimize Rotary Inverted Pendulum Control with Fuzzy Descriptor System - Discover novel robust-optimal controllers for nonlinear systems.
