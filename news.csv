In the ongoing battle of the crypto wars, Graeme Biggar, the director general of the U.K.'s National Crime Agency (NCA), has urged Meta (formerly Facebook) to reconsider its implementation of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Instagram. This call follows a joint declaration by European police chiefs, including the U.K.'s, expressing concern over the expanding use of E2EE by the tech industry, and the potential threats it poses to child safety and the investigation of illegal activities.

The NCA's Concerns and the Role of Law Enforcement

Graeme Biggar, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today program, emphasized the necessity for law enforcement agencies to have access to information that could help protect the public from organized crime and serious threats. With the increasing use of E2EE, platforms like Meta would not be able to provide law enforcement with the information required to safeguard the public.

Currently, platforms are sending tens of millions of child safety-related reports annually to police forces around the world, which result in the safeguarding of approximately 1,200 children per month and the arrest of around 800 people. The concern is that the rollout of E2EE on Instagram and other platforms could lead to a significant decrease in these reports and compromise efforts to combat child exploitation.

Balancing Privacy and Public Safety

While the NCA supports strong encryption to protect users from cybercrime, Biggar insists that there must be a way for tech companies to provide law enforcement with the necessary information to ensure public safety. This is in line with the joint declaration by European police chiefs, who call for the industry to adopt unspecified technical solutions that can offer robust security and privacy while maintaining the ability to spot illegal activity and report decrypted content to law enforcement.

The European Council adopted a similar ""lawful access"" mandate for encrypted messaging in December 2020, but the declaration does not specify which technologies should be implemented for scanning problematic content and sending decrypted content to law enforcement. There are concerns that this could lead to client-side scanning, such as the system Apple planned to roll out in 2","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1182226451.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-22 12:06:00,"""Join the crypto wars debate: Balance child safety & user privacy.

In a fascinating intersection of tradition and technology, Kaffa Roastery, an esteemed artisan roastery in Helsinki, Finland, has unveiled a new coffee blend crafted with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). This groundbreaking creation, christened ""AI-conic,"" is a testament to the harmonious blend of human expertise and AI's data-driven insights.

Finland, a nation of 5.6 million people and the world's leading consumer of coffee at 12 kilograms per capita annually, provides the perfect backdrop for this innovative trial. The AI-conic blend, a meticulously curated mixture of four types of beans led by the velvety Fazenda Pinhal from Brazil, is the brainchild of Kaffa and local AI consultancy, Elev.

The partnership aimed to explore how AI could alleviate the workload in a sector that has long been rooted in manual labor and cherishes its artisanal traditions. Elev's AI, comparable to models like ChatGPT and Copilot, was tasked with creating a blend that would appeal to coffee connoisseurs, challenging the boundaries of conventional flavor profiles.

Svante Hampf, Kaffa's managing director and founder, shared that the trial was initiated to explore the potential of AI in coffee roasting. He explained, ""We gave descriptions of all our coffee types and their flavors to AI and instructed it to create a new exciting blend."" To the surprise of Hampf, the AI selected an unusual combination of four different coffee beans, a departure from the typical two or three bean blends that allow for distinct flavor differentiation.

After the initial test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa's coffee experts concurred that the AI-assisted blend was flawless, requiring no human adjustments. The AI also designed the coffee package label and penned a detailed taste description, defining AI-conic as ""a well-balanced blend of sweetness and ripe fruit.""

Introduction

Raising children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) can be a daunting task for parents. With long waiting periods for diagnosis and high treatment costs, many families struggle to access the necessary care. However, Clarity Pediatrics, a chronic care startup, is changing the game by reducing wait times and offering affordable ADHD therapy.

The Problem: Long Waiting Periods and High Costs

Parents seeking professional help for their children with ADHD often face long waiting periods due to a nationwide shortage of psychologists. The process of receiving a diagnosis and beginning therapy can take several months, which can be incredibly frustrating for families. Moreover, the high cost of treatment can add up to thousands of dollars a year for out-of-network care, making it inaccessible for many families.

Clarity Pediatrics' Solution: Group Therapy for Parents

Clarity Pediatrics offers a solution to this problem by providing behavioral parent training (BPT) in the form of eight-week group therapy sessions for parents of newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed children with ADHD. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends BPT for families of children with mild-to-moderate ADHD. Since young kids are not mature enough to change their behavior on their own, BPT teaches parents strategies and skills to help their children focus in school and control emotional outbursts.

Clarity's Unique Approach

Clarity's approach is unique because it focuses solely on treating ADHD in kids ages five to 12 by providing diagnosis, therapy, and prescriptions. The company's co-founder, Dr. Alesandro Larrazabal, is a pediatrician trained at UCSF and Stanford, and was in charge of specialty services at Kaiser Permanente. Clarity has already provided online care to thousands of families in California and plans to expand its services to other states in 2024.

The Benefits of Clarity's Approach

Clarity's approach has several benefits. Firstly, it reduces wait times from several months to just a few days, for an average $15 co-pay per session. Secondly, BPT has been proven to be effective in treating ADHD in young kids.

TikTok Lite's ""Task & Reward"" Feature Under EU Scrutiny: DSA Compliance Concerns","TikTok, the popular video-sharing platform, is once again under scrutiny from the European Union (EU). The EU has opened a second formal investigation, suspecting TikTok of violating the Digital Services Act (DSA), an online governance and content moderation framework. The Commission is considering imposing interim measures that could force TikTok to suspend access to the TikTok Lite app in the EU, due to concerns about potential mental health risks for users. However, TikTok has been given until April 24 to argue against the measure, allowing the app to remain accessible for now.

The DSA, implemented to ensure a safe online environment, imposes penalties of up to 6% of global annual turnover for confirmed violations. If EU enforcers decide that TikTok has broken the law, ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) could face hefty fines. This investigation is the second probe launched by the EU against TikTok, following an ongoing investigation into multiple aspects of its DSA compliance since February.

The EU's first TikTok probe, which includes examining the protection of minors, advertising transparency, data access for researchers, and risk management of addictive design and harmful content, will not focus on the TikTok Lite app. The latest investigation will specifically target TikTok Lite, a version of the video-sharing platform that launched earlier this month in France and Spain. This version includes a ""task and reward"" feature, where users can earn points for watching or liking videos, which can be exchanged for rewards such as Amazon gift vouchers or TikTok's digital currency.

The EU is concerned about the potential negative impact of this feature on the mental health of young users, as it may stimulate addictive behavior. The Commission has requested ByteDance to produce a risk assessment of the feature, but the company has not complied. As a result, the EU suspects a ""prima facie infringement of the DSA"" by ByteDance.

TikTok is regulated under the strictest regime of the DSA, which applies to around half a dozen larger platforms. This regulation requires these platforms to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks, such as addictive design that could harm users' mental health.

Pomelo, a groundbreaking startup that amalgamates international money transfers with credit, has recently secured $35 million in a Series A funding round led by Dubai-based venture firm Vy Capital. This announcement comes alongside the news of a $75 million expansion of their warehouse facility. The round also saw participation from Founders Fund, A Capital, Afore Capital, and other investors. This investment brings Pomelo's total equity capital to $55 million and their warehouse facility funding to $125 million.

Pomelo: A Fresh Approach to Remittance Transfers

Founded by Eric Velasquez Frenkiel, Pomelo first launched in the Philippines in 2022, enabling users in the United States to send money to the country while simultaneously building their credit profile. The startup has created a remittance product on credit card rails by partnering with Mastercard to introduce a new product category called ""Send Now, Pay Later"" (SNPL). This innovative solution promises faster transactions and no transfer fees compared to traditional cross-border money movement.

How Pomelo Works

Pomelo functions by providing users with an account that includes credit cards. The account creator can set limits, pause cards, and monitor spending habits. Senders can transfer funds, in the form of credit, to family members, which Pomelo claims offers instant access to funds, fraud and chargeback protection, and for potential immigrants who might use this service to send money back home, a chance to enhance their credit score with more transaction history. In the event of non-payment, Pomelo charges a late fee, ensuring that there is no interest on the product. The company generates revenue primarily through interchange revenue, with foreign exchange being a smaller component.

Since its inception, Pomelo has added new payment options, including the ability to send funds to GCash, a popular e-wallet (similar to Venmo) in the Philippines. This feature is particularly significant in the Philippines, where proof of ability to pay is often required before medical treatment.

As a result, users frequently experience slow connection speeds, dropped connections, and poor coverage. To address these challenges, researchers have turned to game theory to develop novel approaches for maximizing Wi-Fi performance.

Game theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions between rational agents. It has been successfully applied to a wide range of fields, including economics, political science, and computer science. In the context of Wi-Fi networks, game theory can be used to model the behavior of individual users and develop strategies for optimizing network performance.

One promising approach is to harness user cooperation using game theory. The idea is to incentivize users to share their Wi-Fi resources with others in exchange for benefits such as faster speeds, longer battery life, or priority access. By treating users as strategic agents who can make choices about how to use their Wi-Fi resources, game theory can help to create a more efficient and equitable allocation of network resources.

For example, a game-theoretic approach might involve offering users the option to join a ""Wi-Fi sharing coalition"" in which they agree to share their Wi-Fi resources with other members of the coalition. In return, they receive benefits such as faster connection speeds or priority access to certain network resources. The coalition could be managed using a smartphone app or other user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily join or leave the coalition as needed.

Another approach is to use game theory to design incentive mechanisms that encourage users to adopt behaviors that benefit the network as a whole. For example, users who are located near the edge of a Wi-Fi network might be offered incentives to move to a more central location where they can provide better coverage to other users. Similarly, users who are consuming a large amount of network resources might be offered incentives to reduce their usage during peak times.

To be effective, these approaches must be carefully designed to ensure that they are fair, efficient, and easy to use. This requires a deep understanding of the incentives and constraints facing individual users, as well as the technical characteristics of the Wi-Fi network itself. By combining game theory with insights from fields such as psychology, sociology, and engineering, researchers can develop innovative solutions to the challenges of maximizing Wi-Fi performance.

Introduction

Despite the ongoing funding winter, venture capital (VC) activity in Africa has demonstrated resilience, with major firms on the continent successfully closing their funds. Among these firms is TLcom Capital, an African VC firm focusing on early-stage startups, which has recently concluded fundraising for its second fund, TIDE Africa Fund II, raising a total of $154 million. This final close positions TLcom as the largest investor across seed and Series A stages in Africa, emphasizing the growing recognition of the continent's investment potential.

The TIDE Africa Fund II

TLcom Capital's oversubscribed TIDE Africa Fund II, initially targeted at $150 million, attracted participation from over 20 limited partners, including prominent investors such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), Visa Foundation, Bertelsmann, and AfricaGrow, a joint venture between Allianz and DEG Impact. The firm managed to close the second fund in a shorter timeframe than its preceding fund, despite being twice its size, attributing this success to an improved understanding and acceptance of venture capital in Africa among limited partners.

Consistent Investment Strategy

Unlike many VC firms that progress from backing startups in pre-seed and seed stages to later-stage investments with subsequent funds, TLcom maintains a consistent strategy. The firm focuses on traditional sectors like fintech, mobility, agriculture, healthcare, education, and commerce, prioritizing early-stage opportunities, particularly at the seed and Series A stages. TLcom has deployed capital in follow-on rounds at later stages across both funds, with a Series C investment in Andela and participation in a Series B extension round in FairMoney.

Assessing Early-Stage Opportunities

When evaluating early-stage opportunities, TLcom assesses the potential of companies to generate 10x to 20x returns. This approach ensures that successful companies compensate for losses, allowing the firm to achieve 3x to 4x returns on an aggregate basis. To improve risk management, TLcom supports repeat founders and invests earlier in deals.

Introduction

The Linux kernel, the heart of the Linux operating system, is constantly evolving, with new versions and updates being released regularly. To stay updated on the latest developments in the Linux kernel, subscribing to the Linux Kernel Mailing List or Linux Weekly News (LWN) is recommended. However, for a broad and quick overview, attending a state-of-the-kernel presentation by a Linux kernel developer, such as Jonathan Corbet, can be extremely informative.

The Calm and Steady Linux Kernel

At Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, Corbet discussed the state of the Linux kernel, stating that everything is ""calm and steady and boring"" with the next kernel, Linux 6.9. This calmness is good news, as it indicates that the kernel is stable and functioning as intended.

However, Corbet also highlighted some concerning news. Due to the unique nature of the Linux kernel, bugs have the potential to become vulnerabilities, making the kernel a prime target for attacks. To address this issue, Linux kernel developers have started issuing their own Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) notifications, with hundreds of CVEs assigned in recent months.

Ensuring the Safety and Security of Linux Systems

To ensure the safety and security of Linux systems, running long-term stable (LTS) kernel releases is recommended. LTS releases have fixed CVEs, and as new issues are patched, they're ported into the LTS kernels. However, it should be noted that LTS releases are now only supported for two years, not six, as was the case in the past.

If you're not sure what version of the kernel you're running, simply run the following command from the shell:

$ uname -r

If you get any result besides a blank, you're running an LTS.

The Decrease in Use of Older Kernel Versions

Introduction

In the era of high-tech phone cameras, where image processing and granular controls are the norm, there's still a soft spot for the nostalgia of old-school photography. Alex Fox, an independent developer, tapped into this sentiment while creating the Mood.camera app for iPhones. This unique app takes users back in time, offering a refreshing departure from the modern approach to mobile photography.

The Mood.camera Experience

Mood.camera allows users to switch between various retro filters to capture photos, harkening back to the days of physical film rolls. The app also features a dial for adjusting quality and tone, reminiscent of traditional cameras' settings. Users can easily switch lenses and adjust exposure directly from the main screen.

What sets Mood.camera apart is its clever omission of a live preview feature. Instead, users see the same image in the viewfinder as they would in the default camera app. This design choice encourages users to focus on the moment and the subject, rather than getting preoccupied with filter selection or editing. Moreover, Mood.camera does not have an editing feature or the option to import photos for filter application, making each shot a genuine, in-the-moment experience.

A Conscious Design

According to Fox, the idea behind Mood.camera was to recapture some of the magic lost in photography's shift towards convenience and control. By reducing modern conveniences, users are nudged to be more present and less focused on perfecting their images.

Fox started working on a prototype of the app in October 2023 and released a beta version on Reddit earlier this year. Since then, a community of photographers has helped him refine the app by taking over 100,000 photos. Mood.camera is free to try for seven days, after which users can opt for a $1.99 monthly subscription or a one-time fee of $14.99.

A Sustainable Future for Indie Apps

In recent years, apps like Lapse, Dispo, and Later Cam have attempted to recreate elements of retro cameras by imposing limitations on their functionality. While some, like Lapse and Dispo, initially attracted investors, their","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/heroHeader.jpeg?resize=1200,755",2024-04-22 12:12:46,"Experience Mood.camera: A refreshing iOS app with old-school photography vibes

Introduction

A sense of nostalgia is taking the world of mobile photography by storm. Aiming to bring back the charm of old-school cameras, developers are creating a new generation of iOS camera apps that impose limitations on functionality, making the experience more authentic and engaging.

The Nostalgic App Experience

Nostalgic apps like Mood.camera, Lapse, Dispo, and Later Cam offer users a chance to capture photos using vintage filters and settings. These apps often lack modern features like live previews, editing tools, or the option to import photos, encouraging users to focus on the moment and appreciate the simplicity of the past.

Mood.camera, for instance, takes users back to the days of physical film rolls by allowing them to switch between retro filters and adjust quality and tone with a dial. The app does not have a live preview, a feature that encourages users to concentrate on their subject and the environment.

A Deliberate Approach

The creators of nostalgic camera apps aim to recapture the magic lost in photography's shift towards convenience and control. By imposing limitations, these apps nudge users to be more present and less concerned with perfecting their images.

For example, Mood.camera's developer, Alex Fox, started working on the app in October 2023 and released a beta version on Reddit. A community of photographers helped refine the app by taking over 100,000 photos, contributing to its development and success.

Sustainable Revenue Models

While some nostalgic app creators initially attracted investors, they eventually adopted sustainable revenue models to maintain their independence. Apps like Mood.camera offer a free trial period, after which users can choose a $1.99 monthly subscription or a one-time fee of $14.99.

This approach allows indie developers to create unique and innovative apps while building a loyal user base. By embracing the nostalgic touch, these developers tap into a growing market of users who seek a more authentic and engaging photography experience.
