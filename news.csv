In recent years, hardware manufacturers have made significant strides in developing confidential computing technologies. These advancements aim to provide companies and governmental organizations with the ability to process sensitive data securely using shared cloud computing resources. Confidential computing protects sensitive data by isolating it in a secure area, inaccessible to other users and even the cloud provider. However, computer scientists at ETH Zurich have discovered potential vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to access these systems and the data within them.

The ETH Zurich research team, led by Professor Shweta Shinde, discovered security gaps while examining confidential computing technologies in AMD and Intel processors. The team aimed to understand the inner workings of these processors to develop an eavesdrop-proof smartphone based on confidential computing. The core of confidential computing lies in the trusted execution environment (TEE), a hardware-based component that isolates applications during processing. This isolation ensures data protection, even when stored unencrypted in working memory.

Hypervisors: A Double-Edged Sword

In a public cloud setting, applications are isolated using a TEE, primarily from hypervisors. Hypervisors are crucial for cloud providers, as they manage resources, optimize hardware usage, and ensure secure separation between different users on the same cloud. However, hypervisors also present a potential security risk. Under certain conditions, attacks on hypervisors can grant unauthorized access to data stored in the memories of other active cloud users.

Fundamental Limitations in Isolation

Despite the necessity of hypervisors for cloud services, there are inherent limitations to user system isolation and protection from hypervisors. The hypervisor must maintain some level of communication with the user system, and it must retain the ability to perform essential tasks such as resource allocation and virtual server management. The ETH Zurich researchers exploited these necessary interfaces, specifically targeting interrupt management between the hypervisor and the TEE.

The Ahoi Attack: Exploiting Interrupt Vulnerabilities

The ETH team developed the Ahoi attack to exploit the hypervisor's role in sending coordinated interrupts to the secured system at any time. This security gap allows the TEE to unknowingly process interrupts coming from an untrusted source, potentially granting un",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2020/computerchips.jpg,2024-04-04 17:06:03,"Meta Description: Discover security gaps in confidential computing with ETH Zurich's Ahoi Attack on AMD & Intel processor TEEs.

In many parts of the world, people are unaware that there are alternatives to the Microsoft-dominated desktop landscape. However, in the European Union (EU) and China, users are well-acquainted with Microsoft's desktop monopoly, and many are eager to explore alternatives. In a significant move, Dirk Schrödter, the digitalization minister for the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, announced that the state government would transition from proprietary software to open-source systems for its 30,000 employees.

Schleswig-Holstein's cabinet decided to replace Windows and Office with Linux and the popular open-source office suite, LibreOffice. This shift is primarily driven by the pursuit of digital sovereignty, allowing the state to maintain control over its data and IT solutions. In the EU, digital sovereignty involves safeguarding citizens' data and enabling European tech companies to compete on a level playing field with their American and Chinese counterparts.

As The Document Foundation points out, ""When a public administration uses proprietary, closed software, it's difficult to know what happens to users' data."" This concern resonates with European governments, who have expressed skepticism about Microsoft's efforts to meet the EU's digital sovereignty requirements. Schrödter emphasized the importance of data protection and control, stating, ""As a state, we have a great responsibility towards our citizens and companies to ensure that their data is kept safe with us.""

In addition to digital sovereignty, the state government aims to achieve cost savings and enhanced security by transitioning from Office and Windows to LibreOffice and a yet-to-be-determined Linux desktop distribution. They also plan to replace Microsoft-specific programs with open-source alternatives, such as using Nextcloud, Open Xchange/Thunderbird, and the Univention Active Directory (AD) connector instead of SharePoint and Exchange/Outlook.

This decision echoes Munich's 2004 transition from Windows to Linux, which lasted for a decade before the city returned to Windows.

A few moments ago, I was sitting at my table, gazing at a vase of wilted Trader Joe's flowers when, all of a sudden, I felt the table tremble. It took me a few seconds to realize that I had just experienced an earthquake in New York. I was taken aback, but once I gathered my thoughts, I checked the tweets - or, as I now prefer to call them, microblogging site updates.

Within seconds, people on these platforms had already established the earthquake's magnitude and scope. They confirmed that it was, indeed, an earthquake and began sharing jokes and experiences related to the situation. This spontaneous event brought together people from various regions, including New Jersey, Philadelphia, New York City, and Massachusetts. Everyone was eager to share their feelings and reactions, reminiscent of the early days of Twitter, where users could express themselves openly without fear of judgment or irony.

The experience reminded me of the classic Twitter era, where people posted about their everyday lives without worrying about whether anyone cared. It was a time when you could share something as simple as ""eating a ham and cheese sandwich"" without any pretense. It was also similar to the early days of LiveJournal or Facebook statuses, where sharing your feelings was encouraged and appreciated.

In the aftermath of Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition, many users migrated to alternative platforms such as Bluesky, Mastodon, and Tumblr. While these platforms offered unique features, they lacked the sense of unity that Twitter once provided. Moments like these earthquake-induced microblogging frenzy remind us of the value of the ""public town square"" concept, where people can quickly learn about and discuss significant events, providing a sense of calm and camaraderie.

However, when the most popular town square becomes increasingly hostile towards those who don't fit a specific mold, we realize what we're missing.

Introduction

Imagine a world where managing chronic diseases is made more accessible and efficient through a compact, affordable mass spectrometer that fits right in your home. This vision is a step closer to reality, thanks to the groundbreaking development of a low-cost, high-performance miniature ionizer by a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Ionizers are a critical component of mass spectrometers, which identify the chemical components of a sample by sorting charged particles based on their mass-to-charge ratio.

The Challenge of Mass Spectrometers

Mass spectrometers are typically confined to laboratories due to their high cost, which can range from several hundred thousand dollars. This limitation poses challenges for those managing chronic illnesses requiring constant monitoring, as blood samples must be sent to a lab for testing. The researchers' goal is to make mass spectrometry local and accessible for at-home use, revolutionizing how chronic diseases are managed.

A 3D-Printed Ionizer: A Game Changer

Led by Luis Fernando Velásquez-García, a principal research scientist in MIT's Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL), the team has developed a miniature ionizer that outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts by a factor of two. This compact device is manufactured using 3D printing and can be produced in batches, making it more cost-effective than traditional ionizers that require manual labor, expensive hardware, or clean-room production.

The 3D-printed ionizer employs a clever design and special materials, enabling it to boost performance and offer a more accessible alternative to existing ionizers. The researchers' DIY approach results in a device that works better than more expensive versions, empowering anyone to create their own ionizer.

How the Miniature Ionizer Works

Mass spectrometers analyze the contents of a sample by charging particles, called ions, and sorting them based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Since molecules in blood don't have an electric charge, an ionizer is used to give them a charge before analysis.

Instagram Threads, Meta's answer to Twitter, has yet to reach the heights of its competitor. When the New York/New Jersey area experienced an earthquake, users flocked to Twitter to discuss the event, pushing earthquake and related terms to the top of the platform's Trends section. Threads, on the other hand, didn't register earthquake-related terms until much later in the day.

Despite this, conversations about the earthquake did take place on Threads, with users tagging their discussions with terms like ""EarthquakeThreads"" and ""NYC Threads."" The lack of hashtags on Threads, however, may have contributed to the term not trending, as users are instead using the format ""[term] Threads"" for tagging. This inconsistency in tagging could prevent terms from gaining the necessary velocity to break into the top trends on the platform.

When asked about the earthquake's absence from the top trends, Instagram stated that Threads' top trends are based on various signals, including the number of people talking about a given topic and the number of engagements with posts on that topic. Because the earthquake was a regional event, it may have taken more time for enough people to join the conversation for it to register as a trend.

Unfortunately for Threads, being unable to keep up with trends in real time could hinder its ability to compete with Twitter. Combined with Meta's plan to distance itself from political content, Threads may never fully surpass Twitter, even if it builds similar features.

Twitter's founders saw the platform's potential for delivering real-time information early on, especially during the 2010 San Francisco earthquake. The app quickly grew in popularity, becoming the home for breaking news and active topical discussions.

Threads, while having 130 million monthly active users, has yet to deliver a true Twitter-like experience. The platform's content has been described as random, with users filling their For You feeds with a wide variety of posts.

In summary, while Threads has made progress, it still has work to do in order to compete with the established Twitter.

Occlusion, or the blocking of a robot's sensors by objects, vehicles, animals, or other obstacles, poses a significant challenge in these environments, increasing the risk of collisions and suboptimal pathways. AGRNav, a novel framework developed by researchers at the University of Hong Kong, addresses this challenge by enhancing the autonomous navigation of air-ground robots in occlusion-prone environments.

The Challenge: Occlusions in Complex Environments

Air-ground robots, with their exceptional mobility and long endurance, hold great promise for navigating complex outdoor environments. These robots can assist humans in various tasks, such as searching for survivors after natural disasters, delivering packages to remote locations, and monitoring natural environments. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the presence of occlusions, which can lead to suboptimal trajectories and higher energy consumption.

The Solution: AGRNav Framework

AGRNav, introduced in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, is designed to improve the navigation of air-ground robots in occlusion-prone environments. Comprised of a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) and a hierarchical path planner, AGRNav has demonstrated promising results in both simulations and real-world experiments.

SCONet: Accurate Obstacle Predictions

The SCONet component of AGRNav predicts the distribution of obstacles in an environment and their semantic features using a deep learning approach that requires minimal computational resources. By capturing contextual information and occlusion area features, SCONet enables accurate obstacle predictions.

Hierarchical Path Planner: Energy-Efficient Paths

The hierarchical path planner in AGRNav uses the predictions made by SCONet to plan optimal, energy-efficient aerial and ground paths for a robot to reach a given location. By efficiently searching for energy-saving paths, the framework minimizes collisions and reduces energy consumption.

A groundbreaking study by researchers from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University has unveiled a promising advancement in the field of hard disk drives (HDDs). The team has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium, paving the way for a new era of data storage solutions.

Currently, data centers rely on hard disk drives utilizing perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) to store information at densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/in². As data demands continue to rise, the need for higher areal densities has become crucial. This calls for a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium, such as FePt grains combined with heat-assisted laser writing, which is the basis for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). HAMR can maintain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/in², with the potential for even higher densities when storing multiple recording levels.

The research team, whose study was published in Acta Materialia, has made strides in arranging FePt recording layers in a three-dimensional manner. By fabricating lattice-matched, FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer films, with Ru as a spacer layer, the team enabled the possibility of three-dimensional recording. Measurements of the magnetization revealed that the two FePt layers have different Curie temperatures, allowing for adjustments in laser power when writing and thus making three-dimensional recording possible.

Simulations using a media model that mimics the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media further demonstrated the principle of 3D recording. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly increase recording capacity by stacking recording layers in three dimensions. Consequently, fewer hard disk drives would be required to store the same amount of digital information, leading to energy savings for data centers.

The researchers aim to further refine this technology by developing processes to reduce the size of FePt grains, improve orientation and magnetic anisotropy, and stack more FePt layers. Doing so would result in a media structure suitable for practical use in high-density HDDs, revolutionizing the data storage landscape.

In summary, the prospect of 3D magnetic recording offers a compelling solution to the",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/proof-of-principle-dem.jpg,2024-04-04 11:00:33,"Revolutionary 3D magnetic recording: Boost data storage capacity, reduce energy consumption.

A groundbreaking development in memory technology has emerged from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Researchers, led by Professor Shinhyun Choi from the School of Electrical Engineering, have created a next-generation phase change memory (PCRAM) device that consumes significantly less power than its conventional counterparts. This new PCRAM device holds the potential to replace existing memory technologies, such as DRAM and NAND flash memory, and pave the way for neuromorphic computing in artificial intelligence hardware.

Traditional phase change memory has faced issues like high fabrication costs and substantial power consumption during operation. To tackle these challenges, Professor Choi's team developed an ultra-low power phase change memory device that forms a highly confined nanometer-scale phase changeable filament without requiring expensive fabrication processes. This innovation not only reduces processing costs but also enables ultra-low power consumption, making it an attractive alternative to existing memory technologies.

Memory technology has long been dominated by two primary types: DRAM and NAND flash memory. DRAM, known for its speed, has volatile characteristics, meaning data is lost when power is turned off. NAND flash memory, on the other hand, offers slower read/write speeds but preserves data even when the power is cut off due to its non-volatile nature.

Phase change memory, however, combines the advantages of both DRAM and NAND flash memory, providing high speed and non-volatile characteristics. As a result, PCRAM has garnered attention as the next-generation memory that can replace existing memory technology and is being actively researched for neuromorphic computing applications, which aim to mimic the human brain's functionality.

Conventional phase change memory devices, however, consume a substantial amount of power during operation, making it challenging to create practical large-capacity memory products or realize neuromorphic computing systems. Previous research efforts focused on reducing power consumption by shrinking the physical size of the device through advanced lithography technologies. However, these approaches resulted in increased fabrication costs and complexity without offering significant improvements in power consumption.

To address the power consumption issue in phase change memory, Professor Choi's team developed a method to electrically form phase change materials in an extremely small area. This innovation led to the creation of an ultra-",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/researchers-develop-a-6.jpg,2024-04-04 10:04:57,"Revolutionary ultra-low power PCRAM!

Apple has recently inched closer to revolutionizing productivity for users across various devices. A recently published patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) hints at the company's plans for continuity of applications across devices. This new feature would allow users to transition items they are interacting with between different devices seamlessly.

In December 2023, Apple filed a patent application titled ""Continuity of applications across devices."" This patent describes a system where users can open an application on one device and then shift the item they are working on to another device. The second device would automatically recognize the item and open the relevant app, creating a seamless experience for the user.

At WWDC 2021, Apple demonstrated moving applications across devices. Craig Federighi, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, dragged a file from his iPad through his MacBook to an iMac, opening it in Final Cut Pro. Apple's latest patent application, however, takes this concept further, allowing devices to recognize and share files that users want to interact with across products effortlessly.

As technology users increasingly rely on smartphones, tablets, computers, and even AR/VR devices, enabling seamless transitions between devices could prove incredibly useful.

Here's what experts say, Capture the 2024 Solar Eclipse Safely: iPhone Camera Tips ,"Title: The 2024 Solar Eclipse: Capturing the Spectacle Without Harming Your Smartphone

On Monday, millions of people across North America will witness a rare celestial event - a total solar eclipse. As the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, daytime skies will darken briefly. However, it's crucial to remember that looking directly at the sun, even when it's partially covered, can cause severe eye damage. This rule applies to your smartphone's camera as well.

Most experts, including phone manufacturers and accessory makers, warn that prolonged exposure of your smartphone's camera sensor to the sun's light can result in damage. Runar Bjorhovde, an analyst at Canalys, emphasizes that while it's possible to buy a solar filter for a smartphone camera at a reasonable price, the primary concern should be the safety of the viewer's eyes, which are far more delicate and challenging to repair or replace than a smartphone camera.

The team at Halide Camera, creators of an iOS app offering manual controls for iPhone cameras, advises capturing images only during the eclipse itself. This is when the sun is either obscured by clouds or the moon, reducing the intensity of its light and making it safer for your phone's sensor. Moreover, your phone camera can adjust its exposure levels, light speed, and f/stop more effectively when the sun is obstructed.

During other phases of the eclipse, when the sun is more exposed, your phone's images will likely be blurry, overly bright, and unusable. However, with the right equipment, capturing a visually accurate shot of the eclipse is possible. This includes a telephoto lens attachment for distant capture, a solar filter, and a tripod or selfie stick for stability.

Remember, the solar eclipse is a magnificent natural phenomenon. Prioritize your eye safety and enjoy the spectacle. If you're determined to capture images, do so wisely and consider investing in the necessary equipment to protect your smartphone camera.

Introduction

The Gulf Coast of the United States is no stranger to tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. These phenomena can cause widespread electricity outages, which are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change and global warming. A recent study by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany focused on the Texas power grid, aiming to identify priority lines that should be reinforced to prevent severe outages in the future.

The Impact of Extreme Weather Events on the Texas Power Grid

The research, published in Nature Energy, could serve as a guide for local government and engineers in Texas to enhance the resilience of the electricity grid. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of extreme wind events on transmission lines and towers, as they often lead to further system and infrastructure failures, causing extensive blackouts and power outages.

Identifying Critical Lines for Grid Resilience

Mehrnaz Anvari, the lead author, explained that the research is an interdisciplinary collaboration between impact modeling and infrastructure research at PIK. The study focuses on extreme wind events, which significantly affect transmission lines and towers. The researchers aimed to identify lines critical for maintaining grid functionality and resilience during and after extreme weather events.

Temporal-Spatial Structure of Damages and Outages

The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding the temporal-spatial structure of damages and outages, as the power grid's response to future adverse weather events depends on the history of previous damages. By studying these patterns, the team aimed to identify failure modes that, if addressed, could prevent catastrophic failures during extreme weather events.

The Backbone of the Grid: Identifying Critical Lines

The researchers' approach differs from previous efforts in this field by not only identifying lines most likely to trigger outages in fully functional systems but also examining their impact in instances where the power grid has already suffered extensive damages. This allowed them to better determine the ""backbone"" of the grid, which supports its resilience.

Enhancing Resilience of Critical Lines

Once the critical lines are identified, the researchers recommend",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/exploring-the-resilien.jpg,2024-04-04 06:50:01,"""Strengthen critical Texas power grid lines for extreme weather resilience. Secure energy supply with priority-based reinforcement.""

Introduction

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a significant part of our lives, the impact on the job market is undeniable. To address this issue, some of the world's leading tech companies have formed the AI-Enabled Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Workforce Consortium. This group includes Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP, along with six advisers. Together, they aim to help those who have lost or will lose their jobs due to AI adoption to upskill or reskill and reenter the workforce.

The Impact of AI on Jobs

The consortium was formed in response to the growing number of jobs lost to AI. Companies like UPS and IBM have already acknowledged layoffs and hiring freezes due to AI adoption. According to a study from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, US companies have cut more than 4,600 jobs as they seek new AI-ready hires or replace positions with AI. While many of these cuts are a result of AI innovations developed by ICT participants, the consortium members recognize the need to help workers find new careers in other roles.

Ambitious but Necessary Goals

The AI-Enabled Workforce Consortium has set a goal to ""positively impact over 95 million individuals around the world over the next 10 years."" To achieve this, each company has announced specific plans:

1. Cisco aims to train 25 million people with cybersecurity and digital skills by 2032.
2. IBM plans to skill 30 million individuals by 2030 in digital skills, including 2 million in AI.
3. Intel aims to train more than 30 million people with AI skills for current and future jobs by 2030.
4. Microsoft will train and certify 10 million people from underserved communities with in-demand digital skills by 2025.
5. SAP hopes to upskill 2 million people worldwide by 2025.
6. Google has already announced EUR 25 million in funding to support AI training and skills for people across Europe.

But who decides when AGI is attained?, Measuring Artificial General Intelligence: Challenges and Progress ,"Title: The Pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence: A New Frontier in AI Research

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a futuristic concept of machines that possess broad cognitive abilities akin to humans, has become the driving force behind the missions of OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. This revolutionary technology, once it becomes a reality, could pose existential risks to humanity, as warned by leading AI scientists in a research paper published in the journal Science. But what exactly is AGI, and how will we recognize it when it arrives?

AGI: The Ambiguous Concept

AGI is not to be confused with generative AI, which involves AI systems that generate new documents, images, and sounds. Instead, AGI is a more abstract idea, not a technical term. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist, ""I don't think there is agreement on what the term means. I use it to mean AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do."" Hinton prefers the term superintelligence for AGIs that surpass human capabilities.

The term AGI harks back to the original vision of artificial intelligence, which aimed to build thinking machines before AI research branched into specialized and commercially viable subfields such as face recognition and speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. Mainstream AI research shifted away from this ambitious vision, but a small group of early proponents continues to pursue the idea of AGI.

Measuring AGI: A Work in Progress

Without a clear definition, measuring AGI remains a challenge. ""Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google's) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,"" Hinton said. ""But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.""

Improvements in autoregressive AI techniques and massive computing power have led to impressive chatbots. However, AGI requires technology that can perform just as well as humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning, and the ability to learn from experiences.

Researchers are working towards finding a consensus on how to measure AGI.

Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace has sparked a wave of disruption, raising concerns about job displacement while also offering opportunities for empowerment and growth. This article explores the impact of generative AI on employment, focusing on the balance between job destruction and value creation.

The Dilemma of AI and Job Displacement

In recent years, AI has demonstrated the potential to automate various tasks, potentially replacing human workers in the process. The use of AI as a virtual assistant, as shared in a previous ZDNET article, highlights the technology's capacity to save time and resources. However, as reader @f8lee pointed out, this advancement may come at the cost of job opportunities for those seeking ""grunt work"" experience.

While AI has the potential to replace certain jobs, it also presents an opportunity for businesses and individuals to enhance their productivity. By leveraging AI tools, budget-constrained individuals and small businesses can increase their output, compete with larger players, and potentially regain personal time. Furthermore, AI can help those with linguistic or artistic challenges to produce output that might have otherwise been unattainable.

The Evolution of Work Roles and Career Paths

Technological advancements have always been disruptive, leading to both the creation and obsolescence of jobs. The transition from human-operated telephone systems to electronic switching is a prime example. Although many operators lost their jobs, new opportunities arose to serve the evolving needs of society.

The following video, created by Western Electric around 1940, highlights the benefits, scope, and new skills required during this transition:
