Introduction:
Tesla is moving ahead with plans to establish an unprecedented electric big rig charging corridor connecting Texas and California, undeterred by their failure to secure funds from a federal grant program under President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Although the initial vision might evolve, the project remains significant in promoting sustainable freight transportation.

Original Project Proposal:
Dubbed ""TESSERACT"" (Transport Electrification Supporting Semis Operating in Arizona, California, and Texas), the initiative aimed to construct nine charging stations utilizing approximately $100 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant program and about $24 million from Tesla's coffers. These stations were intended to feature eight 750kW chargers for Tesla Semis and four accessible to various electric trucks. However, the ambitious proposal did not make the list of 47 recipients sharing $623 million in funding earlier this year. Despite securing around 13% of other charging grants through the Infrastructure Act, totalling roughly $17 million, Tesla was notably absent from the latest announcement.

Future Plans & Challenges:
According to Rohan Patel, former Vice President at Tesla, alternative state funding options and subsequent CFI program rounds remain possible avenues for acquiring financial support. With some sites considered 'no-brainers', construction may proceed regardless of external funding. Nonetheless, concerns linger over whether partial completion of the proposed 1,800-mile connection between Tesla's North American manufacturing facilities could effectively serve its intended purpose. Moreover, recently implemented organizational changes at Tesla pose additional challenges. As CEO Elon Musk prioritizes autonomous driving technology development and shifts focus towards creating a robotaxi, resources previously allocated for lower-priced EVs may shift accordingly. Delays have plagued the Semi program, with fewer than 100 units produced thus far. Nevertheless, there have been recent signs of progress; Tesla has attracted prospective clients while simultaneously employing Semis to transport battery packs between production sites.

Conclusion:
Amidst these developments, Tesla persists in advancing their groundbreaking electric big rig charging corridor concept. While awaiting potential funding sources, they continue exploring alternatives to ensure realization of this pioneering endeavor, paving the way for greener commercial transportation solutions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tesla-semi-charging.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-18 20:28:51,"Build the future of electric trucking!

The realm of cloud security is undergoing significant changes, with consolidation becoming an increasingly popular trend. Recently, sources have revealed that Lacework, a cloud security startup valued at $8.3 billion in its last funding round, is in discussions to be acquired by Wiz, another security powerhouse, for a price ranging between $150 million and $200 million.

Though both companies focus on cloud security, they have minimal competitive overlap, making this acquisition primarily a technology, talent, and customer acquisition play. The deal's exact terms, such as whether it would involve stock, cash, or a combination, are still being determined.

Wiz, led by its CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport, has been open about its ambitious plans to reach $1 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) before going public, targeting the end of 2025. With its current ARR of $350 million, Wiz must act swiftly to achieve its goal. Lacework, on the other hand, has an estimated ARR of around $100 million.

Acquiring Lacework could help Wiz move closer to its objectives, offering a strategic advantage in the competitive cloud security market. Wiz's rapid growth and aggressive acquisition strategy have already been demonstrated through its acquisition of Gem Security for $350 million earlier this month.

This acquisition wave is indicative of a broader trend in the security startup ecosystem. Many companies that secured significant funding in recent years are now finding it challenging to justify their high valuations. As a result, some are exploring their options as their funding runway nears depletion.

For instance, Lacework's investors, which include Snowflake Ventures, GV, General Catalyst, Tiger Global, and many more, were reportedly shopping the company around to potential buyers, with Wiz emerging as a serious contender.

Lacework is not alone in facing a valuation adjustment. Just last week, TechCrunch reported that Noname Security was in talks with Akamai for a potential acquisition, following a similar pattern.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/nzero-grid-carbon-intensity-tool/,Building owners are often in the dark about their carbon pollution - a new algorithm could shed light on it, Revolutionary Algorithm Reveals Hidden Building Carbon Emissions ,"Title: Illuminating Carbon Emissions: A Innovative Algorithm Casts Light on Building Owners' Pollution Levels

Introduction

As we tread further into an era of increased environmental consciousness, it's become crucial for building owners to recognize and reduce their carbon footprint. In New York City, starting this year, thousands of building proprietors must begin decreasing their carbon emissions. However, understanding just how much pollution they generate remains a mystery for many. This article introduces NZero, a groundbreaking carbon-tracking startup, and its novel algorithm designed to estimate building carbon pollution down to the hour, making strides towards effective decarbonization strategies.

Unveiling the Importance of Hourly Carbon Emission Estimates

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity comprises 60% of the total energy usage in commercial buildings. While several tools exist to convert electric bills into approximated carbon emissions, many rely on imprecise estimations. As renewable energy sources such as wind and solar continue to expand, recognizing precisely when and how much electricity is used becomes increasingly vital. To tackle this challenge, NZero created a sophisticated algorithm that provides building owners with detailed hourly carbon emission estimates.

Overcoming Data Limitations Through Advanced Estimation Techniques

Although some building owners with advanced meters and sensors may already possess granular energy consumption data, others lack access to this essential resource. According to John Rula, NZero's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), ""Better data leads to improved results; however, it shouldn't hinder progress."" Indeed, limitations in data availability pose significant challenges—particularly for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) operating under what is known as a 'triple net lease.' Under such agreements, the REIT assumes responsibility for a building's emissions, yet the property owner does not directly cover utility costs, leaving them largely blind to the building's actual pollution levels.

NZero's cutting-edge solution leverages the building's address along with any available information provided by the owner, encompassing aspects like square footage and heating and cooling system details. By analyzing these factors, NZero delivers enhanced estimation accuracy compared to previous methods relied upon by building owners.

Guiding Decisions Towards Effective Decarbonization Strategies

Once NZero's software establishes baseline carbon emission patterns, it assists building owners in identifying optimal upgrade and retrofit measures aimed at minimizing emissions while maximizing cost efficiency. Rula emphasizes, ""Decarbonization promotion and acceleration remain our ultimate goals, transcending mere data collection and regulatory compliance reporting phases.""

Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of wearable electronics, researchers from North Carolina State University have made a significant breakthrough. They have developed a fabric-based sensor that combines 3D embroidery techniques with machine learning to create a touch-sensitive device capable of controlling electronic devices (Chen et al., 2024). This innovative sensor, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with wearable technology, is detailed in their paper published in the journal Device.

The Challenge of Wearable Electronics Control

As wearable electronics become increasingly popular, there is a growing need for a more sophisticated and user-friendly control system. Traditional buttons and touchscreens can be clunky, unintuitive, or impractical when integrated into clothing. This challenge led the research team to explore the development of a fabric-based sensor that could activate and control various electronic devices through touch.

Creating the Triboelectric Fabric Sensor

The new sensor consists of two main components: an embroidered pressure sensor and a microchip for data processing and distribution. The pressure sensor is triboelectric, meaning it generates an electric charge from the friction between its multiple layers. This is achieved through the use of yarns made from two triboelectric materials, one with a positive electric charge and the other with a negative charge. These yarns are then integrated into conventional textile fabrics using embroidery machines.

One of the key challenges in creating the sensor was its 3D structure, which required a precise gap between the two layers to optimize the sensor's output. To overcome this, the researchers utilized a spacer to control the gap between the layers, enabling them to fine-tune the sensor's performance.

Machine Learning for Input Recognition

To ensure accurate input recognition and to filter out unintentional inputs, the researchers incorporated machine learning algorithms into the sensor's microchip. This allowed the device to distinguish between different gestures assigned to various functions, while also disregarding any unintentional inputs resulting from the cloth's natural movement or environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.

 Ultrafast Charging: Supercapacitors charge significantly faster than batteries due to ion adsorption instead of complex chemical processes.
 Extreme Durability: With millions of potential charge cycles, supercapacitors outlast batteries by orders of magnitude.
 Robust Design: Unlike batteries, supercapacitors handle extreme temperatures and conditions without compromising performance.

These benefits suggest promising opportunities across numerous industries. Public transportation systems such as buses, trams, and subways equipped with supercapacitors could quickly charge during stops, reducing dependency on extensive charging infrastructure. Moreover, integrating supercapacitors alongside intermittent solar and wind energy production could facilitate smoother power management.

Decoding Disorder: Breakthrough Findings

Dr. Alex Forse and his collaborators identified a critical factor influencing energy density in supercapacitors – structural disorder. By employing advanced computational simulations and experimental techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the team examined various commercial nanoporous carbon electrodes. Contradictory to popular belief, pore size did not directly impact energy storage capacity. Rather, the extent of disorder proved crucial.

Discovering the Potential of Disorder

To investigate further, the researchers utilized NMR spectroscopy to analyze electrode materials' orderliness. Surprisingly, greater disorder correlated strongly with enhanced energy storage capacity. According to lead author Xinyu Liu, ""Energy storage capacity increases as the material becomes more disordered—an attribute previously underestimated due to difficulties measuring messiness."" In essence, embracing chaos unlocks superior energy storage!

Harnessing Chaos: Future Directions

Now that the relationship between disorder and energy density has been established, upcoming research efforts aim to capitalize on this knowledge:

 Develop novel methods for creating increasingly disordered carbons, potentially leading to even higher energy densities.
 Investigate other factors contributing to optimal energy storage efficiency, combining the effects of disorder and additional variables to maximize overall performance gains.
