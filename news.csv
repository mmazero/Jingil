https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Outdoor Days Lost by 2080: MIT Study"" ","Introduction
Climate change has been a global concern for decades, and it's still a challenging concept to make relatable to the general public. However, a recent development by researchers at MIT might change that. They have created a tool that allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked. This tool could help us understand the impact of climate change on our daily lives and make informed decisions about the future.

Body
The MIT tool provides a relatable application of a field of study known as climate scenario analysis. This branch of strategic planning seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. The results of this analysis are alarming or comforting, depending on where you live. For people in California, France, and Germany, the climate will be a bit more clement in the spring and fall, adding anywhere from a few days to nearly a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records. However, some temperate places like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. Elsewhere, the picture looks even more dire. Illinois will lose more than a month of outdoor days by the 2080s as the summers grow unbearably hot, and Texas will lose a month and a half for the same reason.

The countries with some of the most vulnerable populations will suffer the most. Nigeria's summers will grow even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India will lose almost two and a half months. This analysis shows that the impact of climate change will be different for different regions and demographics.

The MIT tool is just one example of the many startups using the relatively newfound predictive capability of climate scenario analysis to help shape an uncertain future. Many of these startups are focused on tackling the uncertainty for investors, lenders, and insurers. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on these markets, supplying customers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. These startups also determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought and deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains. They can also crank out regulatory disclosures, highlighting relevant climate risks.

Other markets exposed to the outdoors are also in need of","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"a tool like MIT's to understand the impact of climate change on their operations. For example, a tool like this could help farmers understand how climate change will impact their crop yields and adjust their planting schedules accordingly. It could also help forestry companies understand how to mitigate the risks of forest fires and protect their investments. Numerous other industries, such as construction, transportation, and tourism, are also exposed to the outdoors and would benefit from such a tool.

As we continue to grapple with the global effects of climate change, it's essential to understand how it will impact our daily lives. By utilizing tools like MIT's, we can make informed decisions about the future and find ways to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

Conclusion
Climate change is a significant challenge that we need to address head-on. By utilizing tools like MIT's, we can understand the impact of climate change on our daily lives and make informed decisions about the future. We need to find ways to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and ensure a safe and sustainable future for our planet.

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) continues to shape our world, concerns regarding its potential misuse have become increasingly urgent. OpenAI, a leading AI research organization, has recently unveiled its voice-cloning tool, named ""Voice Engine,"" which can mimic a person's voice based on a mere 15-second audio sample. However, recognizing the significant risks associated with this technology, OpenAI has decided to maintain strict control over its release until adequate safeguards are in place to prevent audio deepfakes and misleading manipulations.

Disinformation researchers have been raising alarms about the widespread misuse of AI-powered applications, particularly in a critical election year. Voice cloning tools have become both inexpensive and effortless to use, making them increasingly difficult to trace. As a result, the risk of AI-generated deepfake disinformation flooding the 2024 US presidential race and other crucial elections worldwide is more imminent than ever.

In light of these concerns, OpenAI has opted for a cautious approach, acknowledging the necessity for thorough consideration before making Voice Engine available to the general public. This decision comes after a political consultant working for a Democratic rival to Joe Biden admitted to orchestrating a robocall that impersonated the US president. The AI-generated call, designed by an operative for Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips, used a fake Biden voice urging people not to vote in the New Hampshire primary.

To ensure ethical usage, OpenAI has established partnerships with various organizations, including government entities, media corporations, educational institutions, and civil society groups. These partners have agreed to several rules, such as obtaining explicit and informed consent from any individual whose voice is duplicated using Voice Engine and making it clear to audiences when they are listening to AI-generated voices.

Additionally, OpenAI has implemented several safety measures, such as watermarking to trace the origin of any audio generated by Voice Engine and proactively monitoring its use. The ultimate goal is to create a safe and responsible environment for the deployment of this groundbreaking technology while minimizing the risk of AI-generated voice deception.

The development and eventual release of such powerful voice-mimicking tools highlight the importance of establishing robust guidelines and safeguards to protect individuals and societies from potential misuse. By engaging with various stakeholders and implementing stringent measures, OpenAI sets a positive example for other AI research organizations to follow, ensuring that innovation is met with responsibility and care.

With the 2024 US presidential race on the horizon, it is crucial for technology companies, policymakers, and the general public to remain vigilant and proactive in addressing the challenges posed by AI-generated voice deception. By fostering a dialogue centered on transparency, ethics, and collaboration, we can collectively build a future where AI serves as a tool for progress, rather than a source of manipulation and deceit.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/openai-says-ways-to-ve.jpg,2024-03-30 06:23:09,"Title: The Looming Threat of AI-Generated Voice Deception and OpenAI's Cautious Approach

Crypto VCs on the Hot Q1 Investments and How it Compares to Previous Bull Market

2023 may have been a challenging period for crypto venture capital fundraising, but Q1 of 2024 is heating up, with $2.52 billion raised across the crypto and blockchain sectors. This is about 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023, with over 690 deals across stages transpiring during Q1.

According to Tom Schmidt, a partner at Dragonfly Capital, the crypto venture capital funding landscape in Q1 was cautiously optimistic, rebounding from a challenging two-year period. David Nage, portfolio manager at Arca, says he has tracked over 690 deals across stages that have transpired during Q1, about 30 to 40% more than the lows in 2023.

So, what's driving the surge in Q1 investments? Positive effects from legal wins last year from Ripple and Grayscale, positive sentiments around decentralized finance (DeFi) on Solana, and demand for Bitcoin ETFs in the US have all contributed. Additionally, the market didn't die as expected, which is a positive sign for the future.

Macro validation from crypto is also playing a significant role in heating up the crypto venture capital landscape. The launch of crypto ETF products, the Bitcoin halving, projected rate cuts in the US ahead of the upcoming presidential election, and institutional interest converting into real budgets and products are all contributing to the bullish macro backdrop fueling the crypto venture capital market.

One example of institutional interest is BlackRock launching its tokenized tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain, which could lead to heightened competitive pressure from traditional financial institutions and more adoptions.

In terms of deal flow, the crypto startup market has picked up in areas ranging from DeFi to SocialFi to Bitcoin layer-2 growth. While there has been an uptick in both new companies coming to market and existing companies revisiting fundraising, the market in 2024 will be a tale of the 'haves' and 'have nots,' with newer companies building along popular narratives getting funded at rich valuations and many others going out of business.

SocialFi and Web3 gaming are currently very hot sectors, with success stories like Bi.social's $3 million round and Mask Network's $100 million fund to support other similar applications. Modular and AI-integrated blockchains, like 0G labs, are also attracting the attention of venture capitalists.

Competitiveness among VCs is creating an environment in which founders have greater leverage in fundraising, with investors reverse-pitching their value and founders having optionality and the ability to set terms. However, while the power may have shifted slightly from investors to founders, it is ""perfectly balanced"" and will continue to be so in the near future.

In conclusion, the crypto venture capital market in Q1 of 2024 is heating up due to a combination of factors, including positive legal wins, positive sentiment around DeFi, and institutional interest. While there are still challenges to overcome, the future looks bright for the crypto and blockchain sectors, with continued growth and innovation on the horizon.

Autonomous vehicles have long been a fascinating goal for both the robotics research community and the automotive industry. Although many companies have invested in and tested self-driving cars, they have only been deployed in limited settings. A particular area of interest in this field is the concept of automated valet parking (AVP), which enables a car to drive itself from a parking entrance to an available parking spot without human intervention. This application has garnered significant research attention, but its reliable implementation has proven to be challenging.

Researchers from Mach Drive in Shanghai have recently developed OCEAN (Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner), an optimization-based trajectory planner designed for autonomous parking. The researchers introduced OCEAN in a pre-published paper on arXiv, showcasing its ability to enhance the safety and efficiency of cars parking without collisions.

Traditional autonomous parking approaches have struggled with accurately predicting collisions and performing well in real-time tests. OCEAN addresses these issues by improving upon a previously proposed method called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA). This innovative planner overcomes H-OBCA's limitations, ultimately improving its ability to avoid collisions, robustness, and speed in real-time scenarios.

OCEAN's design starts with a hierarchical optimization-based collision avoidance framework. It first initializes the trajectory planning problem with a collision-free Hybrid A trajectory. Then, the collision avoidance trajectory planning problem is reformulated as a smooth and convex dual form, which is solved by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in parallel. The optimization variables are carefully split into several groups, ensuring that the ADMM sub-problems can be efficiently and robustly solved as Quadratic Programming (QP), Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problems.

The researchers tested OCEAN in hundreds of simulated scenarios and conducted real-world experiments in public parking areas. The results demonstrated that OCEAN outperformed various autonomous parking methods, making it a promising solution for large-scale parking planners on low computing power platforms requiring real-time performance.

In summary, OCEAN represents a significant leap forward in autonomous parking technology. With further improvements and real-world testing, this innovative planner could be deployed by automotive companies, paving the way for the widespread introduction of automated vehicle parking technologies.

Introduction

In the era of 6G, mobile vision services are becoming increasingly popular, offering innovative technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and autonomous driving. These services, however, require high-performance processors and accurate learning models to efficiently capture and understand video and image content. To address this challenge, Professor Jeongho Kwak from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST has developed an integrated learning model and resource optimization technology called VisionScaling. This article delves into the fascinating world of 6G vision services and how VisionScaling is set to revolutionize the field.

The Challenge: Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency

The high computing power and complex learning models required by 6G vision services often lead to inefficient resource utilization on mobile devices. Traditional technologies have treated learning models and computing/networking resources as separate entities, resulting in suboptimal performance and energy consumption. To tackle this problem, Professor Kwak's team focused on simultaneously optimizing learning models and computing/networking resources in real time.

VisionScaling: A Game-Changing Solution

Professor Kwak's team has proposed VisionScaling, a new integrated learning model and computing/networking optimization algorithm. This groundbreaking algorithm reduces energy consumption by at least 30% while maintaining average accuracy compared to current technologies, without compromising on average target accuracy or time delay. By adapting to constantly changing mobile environments, VisionScaling maintains optimal performance through the use of 'Online Convex Optimization (OCO),' a cutting-edge learning technique.

Real-World Impact: Energy Savings and Improved Latency

The research team has implemented and tested VisionScaling in a real-world mobile vision service environment using embedded AI devices and connected edge computing platforms.

This is where web3 startup Space and Time comes in, offering a solution through the use of verification and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs). ZK proofs are a cryptographic action that can be used to prove something about a piece of information without revealing the origin data itself.

Space and Time's approach is to be a verifiable computing layer for web3, indexing data both off-chain and on-chain. This allows for efficient and accurate verification of data, and the startup has already indexed data from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Avalanche. They are also adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

Scott Dykstra, CTO and co-founder of Space and Time, sees the need for this solution in the financial industry, as well as in other industries where manipulation of data is becoming more common. He notes that financial institutions often have an incentive to manipulate their records, and ZK proofs can be used to verify and retrieve data.

One of the challenges with ZK proofs is that it can take years to create them for machine learning or large language models (LLMs). This means that the model operator can tamper with the system or LLM to do things that are problematic. Dykstra believes that a decentralized, globally available database is needed to ensure that ZK proofs are created and maintained in a way that is efficient and secure.

Dykstra's most recent concern is that AI data is not really verifiable. He notes that efficient verification of AI data is crucial, and that building ZK proofs for machine learning or LLMs is necessary to ensure that they are executed correctly.

In a hypothetical scenario, Dykstra sees OpenAI as a community-owned and operated database for a journal, where journalists are creating content. This decentralized approach ensures that the database is always available and uncensorable, and that the data is secure and accurate.

Space and Time's solution to data manipulation and verification is a promising approach to the future of AI and blockchain technology. As the world becomes more reliant on data, it is crucial to have solutions in place that ensure its accuracy and security.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1828490321.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 17:00:55,"Optimize this Meta Description for SEO:

The gig economy, often interchanged with the sharing economy, is a modern-day labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. While gig work has its roots in pre-internet times, the proliferation of low-cost broadband internet and smartphones has significantly expanded this labor sector. This article delves into the rise of the gig economy, focusing on Uber's role and the implications for workers and regulators.

The Gig Economy's Humble Beginnings

Before the advent of digital platforms, gig work was evident in traditional self-employment avenues such as plumbing and was also found in the classified ads of newspapers and, later, Craigslist and Backpage. The shift towards computer-based gig platforms like Mechanical Turk, Fiverr, and Elance was made possible by the widespread availability of the internet. However, it wasn't until the smartphone revolution that the gig economy truly took off, with every corner becoming a potential workspace and every task a possible gig.

A Perfect Storm

The rapid growth of the gig economy can be attributed to a combination of factors, including technological advancements and financial anxiety in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. With few job opportunities and economic uncertainty, people were compelled to explore alternative sources of income. This period also saw the rise of the ""sharing economy,"" a term that initially evoked images of resource conservation and collaborative consumption. However, beneath this facade lay a more unsettling reality: the commoditization of skills and assets.

Uber: A Pioneer and Lightning Rod

Uber, a ride-sharing giant, has been at the forefront of the gig economy, capitalizing on this climate of financial instability and regulatory ambiguity. Known for its aggressive expansion tactics, Uber frequently entered markets without obtaining prior approval from regulators, leading to accusations of corporate recklessness. The company's questionable practices, including data privacy scandals, minimal surcharges, and a history of sexual harassment and discrimination allegations, have further tarnished its reputation.

The Impact on Traditional Employment: The Case of Taxi Medallions

The rise of Uber and other ride-sharing services has significantly affected traditional taxi industries. In many locales, taxi medallions functioned as de facto retirement plans for cab drivers, as their value would appreciate over time and could be sold to newcomers. However, the influx of ride-sharing services has caused medallion values to plummet, leaving many cab drivers with substantial debts from medallion purchases.

Compensation for affected drivers has varied across jurisdictions. For instance, Quebec pledged $250 million CAD in 2018 to compensate cab drivers, while Australian regulators applied a per-ride fee to ride-sharing services to offset the impact on medallion holders. In both cases, the burden has fallen on taxpayers and riders rather than the ride-sharing companies themselves.

The Erosion of Worker Protections and Benefits

The gig economy's reliance on independent contractors rather than employees has resulted in the loss of benefits and protections for workers. Uber, for example, has faced multiple lawsuits and investigations over wage theft and misclassification of workers. In response, the U.S. Department of Labor recently issued a final rule making it more challenging for gig economy companies to classify workers as independent contractors. Similarly, the European Union is considering a provisional deal to reclassify millions of app workers as employees.

The Future of the Gig Economy

The gig economy's impact on labor markets and worker protections remains a contentious issue. As more workers seek recognition as employees with benefits and consistent wages, companies like Uber will likely face increased scrutiny and regulatory pressure. Ultimately, finding a balance between the flexibility of gig work and the protections and benefits of traditional employment will be crucial in shaping the future of work.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1_Kh9h_P4emCAe45VfYL_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/70ebe730-e083-11ee-adb4-2a4cdea0f515,2024-03-29 16:45:28,"Meta Description: ""The gig economy has revolutionized the way workers find and access jobs.

The crypto industry has been going through a significant transformation lately, with the end of the last crypto winter and the return to a period of rising token prices and growing trading volume. However, the recent trial and conviction of former crypto baron Sam Bankman-Fried have cast a shadow over the industry, leaving many to question the ethical and moral decisions that led to such a drastic outcome.

The conviction of SBF, who was once a venture and political darling, has brought to light the dark side of the crypto world, forcing the industry to confront its own failings and shortcomings. The sentence of up to 25 years in prison is a stark reminder of the consequences of engaging in fraudulent and illegal activities, and a warning to others who may be tempted to follow in his footsteps.

As we reflect on the events that led to SBFâ€™s downfall, itâ€™s important to remember that the crypto industry is still a relatively new and evolving space. While there have been many successes, there have also been significant failures, and itâ€™s up to us as a community to learn from these mistakes and work towards building a more sustainable and responsible future for the industry.

In conclusion, SBFâ€™s conviction serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry, reminding us of the importance of integrity, transparency, and accountability in our dealings with each other. As we move forward, let us strive to create a more ethical and sustainable industry that prioritizes the well-being of all its stakeholders.
