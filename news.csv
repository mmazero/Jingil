Title: Tech Giants' Ad Transparency Tools Are Lacking, Mozilla Report Finds

The State of Ad Transparency: A Mixed Bag from Tech Giants

Introduction

Tech giants are still working on improving their transparency around the ads they run, according to a recent report by Mozilla and CheckFirst. The report was conducted half a year after the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) rules for larger platforms took effect, requiring companies to maintain a searchable public ads library. This article will discuss the key findings of the report and the state of ad transparency provided by major platforms, including Apple, Google, Meta, TikTok, and X.

Key Findings

The report highlights the following issues with ad transparency tools:

1. Inconsistent ad transparency tools: The report finds that ad oversight tools vary greatly among platforms, with none providing a fully-functional ad repository. This makes it difficult for researchers and civil society groups to monitor the impact of these platforms on upcoming elections.
2. Lack of critical data and effective tools: Researchers still face significant barriers when it comes to producing data-driven insights on the impacts of Big Tech. Adtech giants are not making it easy for independent researchers to study the types of paid messaging targeting different user groups.
3. Inadequate enforcement of DSA regulations: Despite the potential for hefty fines under the DSA, tech giants are not falling over themselves to provide comprehensive ads transparency. Compliance theater is evident in platforms' early responses to DSA demands.

Performance of Major Platforms

The report evaluated eleven major platforms, assigning them a green, yellow, or red rating based on the effectiveness of their ads transparency tools. None of the platforms received a green ""ready for action"" rating.

1. Meta: Although Meta has been operating an ads library the longest, its library still has significant gaps in data and functionality.
2. Apple, LinkedIn, and TikTok: These platforms have similar failings in their ads transparency tools, with notable gaps in data and functionality.
3. Alphabet (Google), Booking.com, and Pinterest: These platforms offer even worse ""bare minimum"" ads transparency tools, according to the report.
