The Resurgence of Analogue Photography: Lapse App Offers a Nostalgic Experience

In a world saturated with digital photography, there's a growing longing for the charm and simplicity of analogue cameras. Lapse, a smartphone app, aims to capture that essence by offering users a unique experience reminiscent of the old days.

With Lapse, you can take pictures that you have to wait to see ""developed,"" just like in the days of film photography. There's no chance for editing or retaking, adding an element of anticipation and excitement to the process. Once developed, you can share your photos with a select group of friends, creating a more intimate and meaningful connection.

Lapse's Success and Funding

Lapse has gained significant traction, amassing millions of users and capturing over 100 million photos monthly. Its consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photographic apps is a testament to its popularity.

Recently, Lapse secured $30 million in funding, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, with participation from previous backers. This funding will fuel the company's ambitious plans to enhance the photo experience, explore video capabilities, and potentially introduce monetization strategies that deviate from traditional advertising models.

Behind-the-Scenes Magic: Enhancing Unedited Photos

Lapse employs a series of sophisticated technological processes to optimize the quality of unedited photos. These include computer vision algorithms and proprietary techniques that analyze the content of each image, enhancing subjects and overall composition.

While the app doesn't allow for direct editing or multiple takes, users can export photos to other apps for further editing, although these edited versions cannot be shared natively on Lapse.

Growth Strategies and Ethical Concerns

Lapse initially employed growth-hacking tactics, including forced invites, to expand its user base. While this strategy helped the app reach the top of the iOS app stores in the U.S. and U.K., it raised concerns about sustainability and user-friendliness.

In response to these criticisms, Lapse has shifted away from forced invites and now relies on organic growth and word-of-mouth. However, the app still faces challenges in onboarding new users, particularly those sensitive about sharing data on social media platforms.

A Changing Landscape for Consumer Apps

The consumer app landscape is evolving, with users becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when using popular platforms. While dominant players like Instagram and Facebook boast billions of users, they have moved away from the simplicity of sharing with close friends.

This shift has created an opportunity for apps like Lapse, which offer a simpler, more intimate alternative. Lapse's investors believe that there's a growing demand for platforms that focus on authentic connections and real-time updates from friends, a niche that the app is well-positioned to fill.

Conclusion

Lapse's success demonstrates a growing desire for a more analogue, less cluttered social media experience. By embracing the nostalgia of film photography and combining it with modern technology, Lapse offers a unique and refreshing take on photo sharing. As the app continues to evolve and address user concerns, it has the potential to carve out a significant space in the ever-changing world of consumer apps.

In a world where digital photography reigns supreme, a new app called Lapse is taking us back to the analog days of film cameras. With Lapse, you can capture moments like never before, embracing the charm and simplicity of the past.

Gone are the days of instant gratification and endless editing. With Lapse, you take a picture and wait for it to ""develop,"" just like in the old days. There's no chance to retake or edit, adding an element of excitement and anticipation to the process.

Lapse has gained immense popularity, boasting millions of users and a coveted top-10 ranking in the photography app category. The app's success has attracted a new round of funding, totaling $30 million, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners.

The company plans to use this funding to enhance the photo experience, explore video capabilities, and introduce innovative features that stay true to its analog roots.

Lapse's CEO, Dan Silvertown, envisions a future where monetization is done differently. Instead of relying on advertising, the company aims to explore alternative revenue streams that align with its ethos and user experience.

Behind the scenes, Lapse employs sophisticated technology to optimize the quality of your photos. Computer vision and proprietary algorithms work together to enhance composition, colors, and overall aesthetics.

However, Lapse has faced criticism for its initial growth tactics, which involved forced invites and growth hacking. While this strategy helped the app gain traction, it raised concerns about sustainability and user experience.

Silvertown acknowledges these concerns and emphasizes that Lapse has evolved. The app no longer relies on forced invites and has gained a critical mass of users who appreciate its unique approach to photo sharing.

Lapse represents a refreshing alternative in a world dominated by social media giants. It offers a simpler, more authentic way to connect with friends and share moments that matter.

As consumers become increasingly aware of the trade-offs involved in using popular social media platforms, Lapse presents an opportunity for a more intimate and meaningful online experience.

Investors like Jacob Andreou of Greylock see potential in Lapse's concept. He believes that the app can fill a void in the market for a platform dedicated to sharing with close friends, reminiscent of the early days of social media.

Lapse's journey is a testament to the enduring appeal of simplicity and authenticity in a world craving genuine connections. As the app continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how it navigates the challenges of monetization and user growth while staying true to its core values.

In the realm of social media, a fierce battle is unfolding, with Instagram's Threads emerging as a formidable contender to Twitter's X (formerly known as Twitter). While app downloads may not be a precise measure of usage, they offer valuable insights into the market's trajectory.

Threads has consistently outpaced X in terms of daily downloads, both on iOS and Google Play. This trend suggests a shift in user preference, with Threads gaining traction among those seeking a microblogging platform.

The surge in Threads' popularity can be attributed to several factors. Meta, the parent company of Instagram, has actively promoted Threads within its other platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. This strategic move has undoubtedly driven traffic to Threads, boosting its visibility and downloads.

Moreover, Threads has garnered positive feedback from users, particularly in Japan, a market where Twitter had a strong foothold. This suggests that Threads' user-friendly interface and features resonate with a diverse audience.

In contrast, X has faced challenges related to its rebranding from Twitter. While there has been a slight increase in monthly downloads, the numbers remain significantly lower compared to the pre-rebranding period. Additionally, concerns have been raised regarding the prevalence of automated accounts and spam on X's platform.

Decentralized X alternatives, such as Mastodon and Bluesky, have yet to make a significant impact in the face of this competition. While they offer a decentralized approach to social networking, their user base remains relatively small compared to Threads and X.

As the battle for microblogging supremacy continues, it remains to be seen whether Threads can maintain its momentum and dethrone X as the dominant platform. However, the current trends indicate a growing preference for Threads among users seeking a user-friendly and engaging microblogging experience.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/as-data-takes-center-stage-codified-wants-to-bring-more-automation-to-governance/,"As data takes center stage, Codified wants to bring flexibility to governance","

In the realm of enterprise software, data has ascended to a position of paramount importance, a trend that has only been amplified by the advent of large language models. However, this data-centric landscape is also fraught with regulatory complexities, making compliance a critical yet daunting challenge for businesses.

Enter Codified, an innovative startup emerging from the Madrona Ventures incubator, poised to revolutionize data compliance. Founded by Yatharth Gupta, a seasoned data veteran, Codified aims to empower companies to harness the transformative power of data while ensuring compliance with regulatory mandates.

Gupta recognizes the pivotal role data plays in modern technology, yet he observes the struggle companies face in controlling access to this valuable asset. He explains, ""Companies possess vast amounts of data, and they want people to utilize it. However, they need to ensure that the right individuals have access while safeguarding it from unauthorized parties. This challenge is incredibly difficult to address.""

With a clear mission, Codified embarks on a journey to unlock innovation within organizations by facilitating compliant access to data. Gupta highlights the shortcomings of existing software solutions, which often lack the flexibility to adapt to evolving use cases, leaving companies vulnerable to compliance breaches.

Codified's groundbreaking approach involves translating policies into code, enabling seamless implementation across diverse applications and easy modification to accommodate new user categories or customer requirements. Gupta elaborates, ""We empower users to create policies in natural language, using a declarative approach or a user-friendly interface. Once these policies are defined, we codify them into a format that can be implemented in various ways and easily modified.""

Furthermore, Codified empowers customers to establish conditions for data access, such as verifying whether an employee has undergone security training within the past year or confirming their involvement in a sensitive project. This granular approach enables companies to establish data access rules based on individual identities and their roles within specific applications or projects, eliminating the need for group-based rules that often fail to keep pace with employee movements and job changes.

Gupta's extensive experience in the data domain, spanning 15 years at Microsoft and several years at Singlestor, has equipped him with a deep understanding of the challenges Codified seeks to address. With a team of five full-time employees and six contractors, he is diligently refining the product through collaborations with design partners. A release candidate is anticipated later this year.

Codified's vision has attracted the support of notable investors, including Vine Ventures, Soma Capital, and Madrona Venture Labs, where the company was nurtured during its formative stages. This funding will fuel Codified's mission to empower businesses with compliant data access, unlocking innovation and driving growth in the digital age.

In the realm of crypto, where innovation and complexity intertwine, Initia, a brainchild of a team of dedicated developers, is pioneering a new chapter in blockchain interoperability and app chain creation. While popular blockсhains like Ethereum and Bitcoin hold a prominent position, app chains are gaining momentum, empowering developers with the freedom to customize economic and governance structures.

However, this fragmented blockchain landscape poses challenges for users, requiring them to navigate through a maze of gas fees, wallets, and explorers. Initia's co-founder, Ezaan Mangalji, aptly captures this dilemma: ""This complexity multiplies when transferring assets between blockсhains, leading to a fragmented experience.""

https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2024/02/27/yes-you-can-donate-blood-after-receiving-a-covid-19-vaccine/,"Yes, You Can Donate Blood After Receiving a Covid-19 Vaccine","

Unveiling the Truth: Debunking the COVID-19 Vaccine and Blood Donation Myth

In the realm of public health, blood donation stands as a beacon of altruism and life-saving generosity. However, recent rumors have cast a shadow of doubt, suggesting that the American Red Cross bars individuals from donating blood after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. This misinformation, if left unaddressed, could pose a grave threat to the nation's blood supply, especially given the widespread vaccination efforts underway.

Let's set the record straight: the American Red Cross unequivocally affirms that blood donation remains open to those who have received COVID-19 vaccines, with a few exceptions.

The confusion appears to stem from the organization's eligibility criteria, which specify certain guidelines for individuals who have received live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines employ a weakened form of the virus to stimulate the immune response without causing illness. While safe for most, they may pose a potential risk to immunocompromised individuals, such as those undergoing cancer treatment.

To ensure the safety of both donors and recipients, the Red Cross requests a two-week waiting period before blood donation for those who have received live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines. This precautionary measure aims to minimize any potential risks associated with weakened viruses.

It's crucial to emphasize that this waiting period applies only to live attenuated vaccines, which are not widely available in the United States. The vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the country, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, are non-replicating or RNA-based. These vaccines do not contain live viruses and pose no risk of transmission through blood donation.

Therefore, individuals who have received these commonly used COVID-19 vaccines can donate blood immediately, without any waiting period. The Red Cross urges those who are eligible to donate to step forward and help replenish the nation's blood supply, which faces an ongoing shortage.

The American Red Cross has issued a clear statement reiterating that most individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccines can donate blood without delay. This includes those who have received a combination of different vaccine types. Additionally, unvaccinated individuals are also welcome to donate, as their blood is equally vital in saving lives.

Donating blood is a selfless act that has the power to transform lives. By dispelling misinformation and encouraging blood donation, we can collectively contribute to a healthier and more resilient community.

AI's Subjective Nature: Unveiling the Complexities of Classification

In a captivating MIT AI Ventures class, Assistant Professor Dylan Hadfield-Menell delved into the intricate world of AI classification, challenging our understanding of data and its role in shaping AI systems.

Professor Hadfield-Menell began by posing a fundamental question: ""How do we measure what AI does?"" Using computer vision and classification as examples, he emphasized the subjective nature of data and the complexities that arise when evaluating AI's capabilities.

The discussion centered around the idea that data is not an objective reflection of reality but rather a subjective property of the world. This perspective raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of AI systems, especially when dealing with synthetic data and adversarial examples.

Professor Hadfield-Menell illustrated this concept with a thought-provoking example: Suppose you take a picture of a cat and make slight modifications to it. If an AI classifier misclassifies the modified image, is it necessarily wrong? Or is it simply responding to the subjective changes made to the data?

This example highlights the inherent challenges in defining the boundaries of AI classification. The data used to train AI systems is akin to a computer program, where we instruct the system on what to output. This raises questions about the effectiveness of simply seeking ""better data"" or ""more accurate data."" Instead, Professor Hadfield-Menell argues that we should focus on developing better models that can navigate the complexities of subjective data.

The discussion then explored the concept of determinism in AI systems and the limits of classification. Professor Hadfield-Menell emphasized that data selection choices are essentially programming choices, shaping the system's behavior and capabilities.

This perspective sheds light on recent debates surrounding models like ChatGPT, where users have expressed concerns about the model's perceived ""laziness."" Professor Hadfield-Menell suggests that these concerns may stem from misunderstandings about the model's training and the subjective nature of its outputs.

He stresses the importance of clearly defining what we want AI systems to do, as this can be a challenging task in itself. System designers often tweak various parameters and collect data as an opaque way of programming the system to achieve their desired outcomes.

The key to unlocking the full potential of AI, according to Professor Hadfield-Menell, lies in understanding the subjective choices made by designers and the goals they aim to achieve. This ability to explain the targeting and nature of AI model work will be crucial for effective AI planning and integration into our economy and businesses.

Professor Hadfield-Menell's insights provide valuable food for thought for students and AI practitioners alike, challenging conventional notions of data and accuracy in AI classification. As we continue to explore the boundaries of AI, it is essential to embrace the complexities of subjective data and strive for a deeper understanding of the systems we create.

Mastering Master Data Management Principles for Service Intelligence 2.0

In the ever-evolving realm of customer service, the ability to resolve issues swiftly and effectively is paramount to maintaining customer satisfaction. Master data management (MDM) has traditionally been applied to structured data like customer and product information. However, a transformative approach known as Service Intelligence 2.0, guided by the principles of MDM, is emerging as a game-changer in enhancing issue resolution efficiency.

Service Intelligence 2.0 reapplies the MDM principles of consolidating, cleansing, governing, and sharing service insights data, empowering service agents with actionable insights and driving organizational success. Let's delve into each MDM principle and its application in Service Intelligence 2.0.

Consolidate: Unifying Knowledge from Disparate Sources

Consolidation involves aggregating information from various sources to address an issue comprehensively. Organizations often rely on multiple platforms, making it challenging for technicians to locate the necessary insights promptly. Service Intelligence 2.0 aims to consolidate knowledge from these disparate sources into a unified platform, accessible to service agents at the point of resolution.

However, consolidation is not a straightforward task. Unlike traditional MDM, which focuses on structured data, consolidating unstructured data poses greater variability and complexity. It extends beyond technical aspects, encompassing functional elements aimed at establishing a unified repository containing consolidated knowledge.

Cleanse: Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Insights

Merely consolidating data is insufficient. Data arrives in diverse formats and with varying degrees of reliability. Technicians' approaches to issue resolution may also differ from documented troubleshooting guides. To decipher this data effectively, standardization and cleansing are imperative.

Custom large language models and reference data checks play a crucial role in data cleansing and simplifying data interpretation. They can disambiguate variations in terminology, enabling the identification of similar or divergent resolution paths across data sources. This facilitates the capture of new insights and data elements, informing intervention strategies when necessary.

Governance: Ensuring Accuracy and Alignment with Organizational Objectives

Governance involves not only cleaning and clarifying data but also ensuring that the derived insights are suitable for sharing across the organization. It's crucial to scrutinize the acquired knowledge for potential biases or undesirable patterns before dissemination.

Subject matter experts play a pivotal role in this process, recommending additional steps and tests to ensure accuracy and alignment with organizational objectives. This meticulous governance ensures that shared insights are accurate, unbiased, and conducive to organizational goals.

Share: Democratizing Data for Service Excellence

Following the establishment of a unified repository of intelligent systems, organizations can disseminate this repository or grant access to it through the Service Intelligence 2.0 platform, thereby democratizing data previously dispersed across various silos. Subsequently, it becomes imperative to evaluate how technicians within the organization use this shared data and its impact on service key performance indicators (KPIs) to gauge the success of this initiative.

Conclusion: A Continuous Journey Towards Service Excellence

Service data is dynamic, with manuals, knowledge articles, and new cases continuously evolving. Technicians resolve issues by consulting the service platform or taking actions that may surpass these platforms, underscoring that the processes of consolidation, cleansing, and governance are ongoing rather than one-time efforts.

Mastering MDM principles is indispensable for organizations seeking to optimize issue resolution and enhance service efficiency. By consolidating, cleansing, governing, and sharing data effectively, organizations can harness the power of Service Intelligence 2.0 to drive informed decision-making, foster collaboration, and deliver unparalleled service excellence in today's competitive landscape.

Samsung Breaks Barriers with Industry's First 12-stack HBM3E DRAM

In a groundbreaking feat of innovation, Samsung has unveiled the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E DRAM, setting a new benchmark for high bandwidth memory capacity. This revolutionary chip boasts a staggering maximum bandwidth of 1,280GB/s and a remarkable capacity of 36GB, surpassing its predecessor, the 8-stack HBM3, by a significant 50%.

At the heart of this technological marvel lies a unique stacking architecture. HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) modules comprise multiple DRAM modules vertically stacked, forming layers or stacks. Samsung's latest creation features twelve of these DRAM modules, each boasting a capacity of 24 gigabits (Gb), equivalent to 3 gigabytes (GB).

The memory industry titans, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are engaged in a fierce competition to stack more DRAM modules while maintaining a compact chip height. Their goal is to achieve maximum capacity with minimal thickness.

This year promises to witness a surge in HBM production as the memory chip market recovers from its downturn. The driving force behind this resurgence is the soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The popularity of AI has skyrocketed the demand for GPUs, particularly those manufactured by Nvidia, which are often paired with HBMs.

Samsung's ingenious application of advanced thermal compression non-conductive film (TC NCF) has enabled the 12-stack HBM3E to maintain the same height as its 8-stack counterparts, meeting stringent package requirements. This remarkable film is not only thinner than its predecessors but also eliminates voids between the stacks, reducing the gap to a mere seven micrometers. This innovative approach results in a vertical density that surpasses the 8-stack HBM3 by an impressive 20%.

TC NCF's capabilities extend beyond size reduction. It facilitates the use of small and large bumps during chip bonding. Small bumps are strategically placed in areas designated for signaling, while large bumps are employed in locations requiring efficient heat dissipation.

The HBM3E 12H's enhanced performance and capacity hold immense promise for data centers, offering a significant reduction in total cost of ownership. For AI applications, this cutting-edge technology can accelerate AI training speeds by 34% and accommodate 11.5 times more simultaneous users of inference services compared to the HBM3 8H.

Samsung has already distributed samples of the HBM3E 12H to eager customers and is poised to commence mass production within the first half of this year. This groundbreaking innovation is set to revolutionize the memory landscape, empowering data centers and AI applications with unprecedented capabilities.
