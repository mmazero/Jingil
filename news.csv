Instagram Messages Come to Threads: Bridging Two Apps for Users","Title: A Surprise Message Feature Comes to Threads Users: What It Means for You

In recent news, some Threads users have noticed a peculiar update: the appearance of a ""Message"" button on their peers' profiles. At first glance, it may seem like a long-awaited direct messaging (DM) function for the platform. However, things aren't quite what they appear to be. Instead, tapping the button sends a message directly to the recipient's Instagram inbox â€“ even if the sender doesn't follow them on that platform. While this development offers convenience, several factors warrant consideration. Let's dive deeper into the implications of this change.

It's important to note that while Threads requires an Instagram account, its capabilities don't always align perfectly with those found on the image-sharing giant. As such, the new messaging system merely expands upon existing integration between the two applications. According to Meta, ""This is not a test of DMs within the Threads app;"" rather, it aims to streamline communication across platforms. But how well does this solution meet users' needs?

There are certainly benefits to the updated feature. By enabling messaging through Instagram, users no longer need to navigate away from Threads when communicating with others. Furthermore, since many individuals maintain overlapping friend groups on both networks, connecting with acquaintances becomes less cumbersome. That said, challenges remain.

One issue revolves around expectations; users accustomed to conversing solely within Threads may find Instagram messaging disorienting. Additionally, recipients must venture to the Instagram application to respond, potentially disrupting their flow. Lastly, while Instagram's DM infrastructure serves its purpose adequately, adapting it to accommodate dual-platform use presents obstacles. Thus far, Meta hasn't addressed these concerns publicly.

When questioned about the matter, Meta acknowledged that the Messenger rollout constitutes an expansion of preexisting cross-platform connectivity. Yet, they stopped short of announcing full-fledged DM support within the Threads ecosystem. Given prior statements made by Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri regarding potential complications associated with developing a distinct messaging interface, the decision makes sense. Nonetheless, users eagerly await improvements to facilitate seamless conversations across applications.

To recap, although Threads users now possess the capacity to contact one another via Instagram messaging, several hurdles persist. With time and fine-tuning, however, the situation could improve significantly. Until then, patience remains key as we observe how this evolving landscape unfolds.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d273598145570b7d2074dbe4cba1cc2577f0c264/2024/04/15/c35314d6-755f-4dc3-8cb5-7ce40d18a829/figure-top-threads-testing-direct-messages-but-theres-a-twist.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-15 00:00:00,"""Discover the new cross-platform messaging on Threads!

Introduction:

Ghost, an open-source alternative to subscription-based newsletter platforms such as Substack, is contemplating joining the Fediverse â€“ a sprawling network of interlinked servers encompassing various applications like Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Flipboard, and even Instagram Threads. This prospective leap towards federation sparks curiosity regarding what benefits this may bring to both existing and new Ghost users alike.

Background & Recent Developments:

Federation through ActivityPub has emerged as the most sought-after feature request for Ghost in recent years. In response to these demands, Ghost's founderâ€”John O'Nolanâ€”posted on Threads, seeking user opinions about integrating ActivityPub into Ghost. Interestingly enough, Threads shared this information across multiple servers using its very own ActivityPub integration.

A follow-up survey aims to gauge interest levels and expectations surrounding such a change while collecting feedback on potential improvements and advantages of incorporating federation. While no definitive commitments have been made, public sentiment suggests growing demand for decentralization and portability in digital identities amid ongoing concerns around privacy, data security, and shifting policies on centralized platforms.

Implications of Federation:

Deciding to federate Ghost could revolutionize the publishing experience for countless writers currently utilizing the platform. Posts originally intended solely for websites and newsletters might find additional life within the vibrant ecosystem of the Fediverse. Interactions happening outside Ghostâ€”likes, shares, and repliesâ€”could seamlessly flow back onto the site as comments, fostering organic discussions between readers and authors.

Such a move mirrors earlier efforts by WordPress when they embraced ActivityPub following the development of a compatible plugin. Enabling this feature allows WordPress blogs to connect with individuals throughout the Fediverse, receiving replies directly on their sites as comments.

Industry Reaction & Adoption:

Since posting about exploring federation, several prominent figures have expressed enthusiasm and support for Ghost's initiative. Among them is Mastodon CTO Renaud Chaput, extending assistance for implementing ActivityPub compatibility within Ghost.

Notably, Ghost's emergence as a viable competitor to Substack stems primarily from mounting disagreement amongst creators concerning appropriate content moderation strategies. Some disillusioned ex-Substack writers, including Casey Newton (formerly of The Verge), have already defected to Ghost due to differing perspectives on handling objectionable content and freedom of expression.

Conclusion:

Embracing federation presents exciting opportunities for growth and diversification within the realms of independent publishing and blogging communities. Should Ghost successfully integrate itself within the Fediverse, we anticipate substantial expansion beyond its current install base of over three million instances, further bolstering the collective strength of the decentralized web.

It effectively conveys the gist of the article within the required character limit.","Title: Unmasking WebGPU: A New Frontier for Side-Channel Attacks

Introduction

In today's digital landscape, websites demand increasingly powerful computational capabilities from users' devices. To meet these requirements, web browsers now leverage Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), alongside Central Processing Units (CPUs). JavaScript utilizes programming interfaces like WebGL and the emerging WebGPU standard to harness GPU resources. Although these innovations bring numerous benefits, they also introduce potential vulnerabilities. Researchers from Graz University of Technology discovered that WebGPU could enable side-channel attacks, compromising sensitive user data across various platforms.

Understanding the Risks

These newly identified threats involve spying on confidential information, including data, keyboard inputs, and encryption keys, through seemingly harmless websites. These attacks don't necessitate user interaction, making them even more dangerous. According to Lukas Giner, a researcher at the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications at TU Graz, ""browser manufacturers must address GPU access with the same scrutiny as other critical resources affecting security and privacy.""

Three Types of Attacks

The research team conducted experiments on multiple systems equipped with GPUs from NVIDIA (GTX 1000, RTX 2000, 3000, and 4000 series) and AMD (RX 6000 series). Through these tests, they demonstrated three distinct categories of attacks utilizing WebGPU's cache memory access feature.

1. Keystroke Inference Attack
Using JavaScript, the researchers filled the cache with their own data, tracking modifications to infer user keystrokes accurately and rapidly.
2. Covert Channel Attack
By dividing the cache into smaller segments, the researchers established a clandestine communication channel. Filled and empty cache segments represented binary bits, enabling data transfers of up to 10.9 kilobytes per second. Such channels allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information otherwise isolated from the internet.
3. Encryption Key Extraction Attack
Targeting Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, the researchers monitored cache behavior after filling it with their own AES encryption. By analyzing cache reactions, they successfully pinpointed encryption-responsible components, granting access to the target system's encryption keys. While real-world implementation might present challenges due to simultaneous GPU-based encryptions, the proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of precise algorithmic attacks.

Conclusion

As developers continue enhancing web technologies, understanding and addressing associated security implications becomes crucial. Despite being under active development, WebGPU is supported by popular browsers like Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox Nightly versions. Consequently, the research community and browser manufacturers must collaborate closely to ensure robust defenses against potential exploitation.

Yet, considering Apple's clout, I presumed the intrigue would sustain itself amongst users.

Alas! Quantifiable evidence regarding the gadget's mass appeal remains scanty. Instances of refund requests and contrasting viewpoints do little justice when gauging overall customer delight or market traction. There could very well be countless satisfied users out there who haven't publicly shared their experiences yet.

Tomorrow's Possibilities and Ongoing Contention

Even if the feverishness surrounding Vision Pro has seemingly receded earlier than expected, it doesn't underplay the significance of relentless progression in AR and VR domains. Powerhouses such as Apple and Meta ought to maintain momentum in exploring new horizons within the sphere of eyewear-integrated AR/VR systems. Today's flat screens, even today's sophisticated LCD panels, pale compared to the deeply engaging visual spectacle offered by next-gen wearables.

Being influential entities in consumer electronics, both corporations possess the necessary prowess to reshape display technologies by harmoniously blending them with eyewear. Through sustained investment and commitment towards refining AR/VR use cases, Apple and Meta stand poised to bring forth revolutionary changes impacting every facet of human interaction with technology.

Closing Remarks

To sum up, although the inaugural wave of excitement for the Apple Vision Pro might have tapered off sooner than hoped, it shouldn't obscure the vital role ongoing advancements play in shaping the trajectory of AR and VR industries. Leveraging continuous research & development endeavors led by major stakeholders like Apple and Meta, we edge ever closer to materializing a future marked by ubiquitous deployment of highly sophisticated embedded displays forming an integral part of our regular wardrobe.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/,Change Healthcare stolen patient data leaked by ransomware gang,Stolen Patient Data Leaked: Change Healthcare Hit By Two Ransom Groups - Under Investigation,"A cyber-extortion group, RansomHub, has recently released a portion of allegedly stolen private patient records, following a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare in February. The leaked documents, which include billing files, insurance records, medical information, contracts, and agreements, have been published on RansomHub's dark web leak site. This incident marks the first time that concrete evidence has surfaced, proving that cybercriminals possess medical and patient records from the attack.

Change Healthcare is currently facing a complex situation, as this is the second group demanding ransom payments to prevent the release of stolen patient data within two months. The first ransomware group responsible for the attack, ALPHV, claimed to have stolen the data and demanded a ransom. However, they suddenly disappeared with a $22 million ransom payment, leaving an affiliate to claim responsibility for the data theft. This affiliate alleges that they were not paid their share of the ransom by ALPHV and still possess the stolen data. RansomHub has now emerged, claiming to have the data, which suggests a dispute between ransomware gang members and affiliates.

UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Change Healthcare, has stated that there is no evidence of a new cyber incident. The company is collaborating with law enforcement and external experts to investigate the claims and understand the potential impact on the data. UnitedHealth has not disclosed whether they paid the ransom or the amount of data stolen in the attack.

In a statement released on March 27, UnitedHealth stated that they had obtained a dataset ""safe for us to access and analyze"" following the ransom payment. The healthcare giant is prioritizing the review of data that they believe would likely have health information, personally identifiable information, claims, eligibility, or financial information.

This incident highlights the ongoing challenge of ransomware attacks in the healthcare industry and the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive patient data. Companies must remain vigilant in their efforts to prevent and mitigate the impact of these attacks, ensuring that patient privacy and security remain a top priority.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/unitedhealth-change-uhc-uhg-optum-breach-ransomware.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-04-15 19:38:52,Discover how Change Healthcare faces a double ransom demand; protect patient data with effective cybersecurity!

In the ever-evolving world of app development and tech giants, a fascinating drama recently unfolded. The star of our story is iGBA, a Game Boy emulator app for iPhone users, which had an ephemeral existence in Apple's App Store. This event sheds light on Apple's recent policy changes, the complexities of open-source software, and the passions of independent developers.

Apple's App Store has long been known for its stringent regulations, but recent EU regulations forced the tech titan to reconsider its stance on retro game emulators. This led to the approval of iGBA, an ad-supported copy of the open-source project GBA4iOS, which allows users to play Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color ROMs. However, the journey of iGBA was short-lived, as it was removed from the App Store soon after its launch.

The primary reason for its removal was that iGBA was submitted without the permission of GBA4iOS developer Riley Testut, who also created AltStore and Delta, a popular Nintendo emulator. Testut expressed his frustration on Threads, stating, ""I've bit my tongue a bunch in the past monthâ€¦but this really frustrates me."" Despite the fact that GBA4iOS was distributed under a GNU GPL v2 license, Testut had added a custom restriction that prohibited App Store distribution for any work containing the code, making iGBA's actions questionable.

The open-source community was quick to point out that such restrictions were not technically allowed under GPL v2, sparking a debate over the limits of open-source licensing. However, Apple decided to remove iGBA for violating its guidelines regarding spam and copyright, effectively siding with Testut.

Apple's recent policy changes, driven by the EU's Digital Markets Act, allowed for streaming game stores and retro game emulators on the App Store. However, the games must use in-app purchases if they offer downloads of digital items. In the case of iGBA, it was a free and ad-supported app, making its removal from the App Store less impactful on Apple's bottom line.

A passionate indie developer attempted to bring joy to iOS users by offering a Game Boy emulator called iGBA. Although initially approved due to Apple's updated policies, the app quickly faced the axe when issues surrounding unauthorized usage of open-source code came to light. The incident illustrates the challenges of balancing innovation, respecting creators' rights, and abiding by the rules set forth by both platform holders like Apple and open-source licenses.

Conflicting Interests Collide

At the heart of the issue lies the clash between the interests of different stakeholders involved. Independent developers seek opportunities to share their creations while complying with Apple's strict App Store regulations. Meanwhile, owners of original projects like GBA4iOS wish to protect their intellectual property and maintain control over how their works are distributed. Ultimately, these conflicts lead to situations where apps like iGBA find themselves caught in the crossfire.

Navigating Open Source Licenses

Open source licenses provide freedoms to modify and distribute software, yet impose certain responsibilities upon those using them. Developers need to understand the implications of utilizing such licenses and ensure compliance to avoid disputes. For instance, the GNU General Public License (GPL) requires derivative works to retain the same terms and conditionsâ€”a rule that appears to have been disregarded by the creator(s) behind iGBA. Consequently, understanding the intricacies of open source licenses can prevent unnecessary complications and safeguard one's reputation.

Moving forward, it is crucial for all parties involved to strike a harmonious balance between fostering creativity, protecting intellectual properties, and upholding the principles of open source licensing. By doing so, we can promote growth in the app ecosystem while maintaining trust among developers and ensuring fairness across platforms.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

In a surprising turn of events, Tesla recently announced significant layoffs, affecting high performers and various departments, primarily due to financial performance concerns. As the electric vehicle (EV) giant prepares to release its Q1 earnings, we delve into the reasons behind these decisions, their impact on different teams, and the future trajectory of the company. Additionally, we discuss the departure of two top executives and analyze the potential consequences.

Financial Performance and Layoffs

Last month, Tesla's management informed employees that layoffs, totaling more than 10% (approximately 14,000) of the global workforce, would take effect. These cuts spanned all departments and seniority levels and aimed to reduce costs and boost productivity in anticipation of ""the next phase of growth,"" according to an internal email from CEO Elon Musk. Although Tesla delivered a record 1.81 million vehicles in 2023, its profit margins suffered following consecutive price reductions designed to stimulate sales and outperform competitors.

Impact on High Performers and Specific Departments

Interestingly, many high performers were among the laid-off employees, causing concern about the loss of talent and the status of certain projects. While specific projects remain undisclosed, some departments faced layoffs exceeding the 10% threshold mentioned in the company-wide email. For instance, one manager confirmed losing 20% of their team, including highly skilled individuals.

Shifting Focus Towards Autonomous Vehicles

Simultaneously, Tesla is realigning its priorities towards developing fully autonomous cars. Recently, the company abandoned plans for a lower-cost EV, initially planned for a $25,000 starting price. Instead, Tesla intends to utilize the same platform to introduce an alleged robotaxi, set to debut on August 8.

Previously, Musk attempted to fast-track a dedicated robotaxi vehicle project, pushing for a ""clean robotaxi"" without a steering wheel or pedals. However, Tesla's lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, and Engineering VP Lars Moravy continued working on the low-cost EV project discreetly. Eventually, Musk agreed to proceed with both venturesâ€”that is, until news broke last week indicating that he had reversed his decision.

Departure of Top Executives

Two prominent Tesla executives, Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel, departed from the company recently. Baglino, Tesla's Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy, cited eighteen years of experience as his reason for leaving. Meanwhile, Patel, Vice President of Public Policy and Business Development, attributed his resignation to ""big overall changes"" at Tesla.

Implications of Executive Exits

Baglino's departure raises questions regarding the future of powerdrive and new battery initiatives. Financial expert Sandeep Rao suggested that Tesla might lack innovative avenues in these areas, prompting Baglino's exit. Following Baglino's announcement, former Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn resigned earlier this year, further highlighting executive transitions at the company.

Conclusion

Tesla's ongoing transformation reflects strategic shifts in response to market conditions and technological advancements. By focusing on fully autonomous vehicles and streamlining its workforce, the company aims to bolster efficiency and pave the way for long-term success. Despite the challenges posed by executive exits, Tesla remains committed to pioneering innovations in the EV industry while enhancing shareholder value.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1239416832.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-15 22:30:03,"Meta Description:

Introduction

Renowned entrepreneur Elon Musk recently announced plans to combat bots and spam on the popular social networking platform, X, by introducing a small fee for new users looking to post content. In response to concerns regarding an influx of automated accounts and troll farms, Musk believes this measure may help alleviate some of the challenges faced by the platform. Let's delve deeper into the reasons behind this decision and how it may impact X's community.

The Bot Problem and Its Impact

Artificial Intelligence (AI), including sophisticated bots and troll farms, poses a challenge for many online platforms as they attempt to distinguish genuine human interaction from automated activities. These malicious actors often exploit such networks for personal gain, spreading misinformation, propaganda, or causing disruptionsâ€”all of which undermine healthy discourse among real users. According to Musk, current AI systems and troll farm operations easily circumvent existing measures designed to detect bots, necessitating alternative solutions.

Musk's Proposal for User Fees

To address the issue, Musk revealed his intention to impose a modest fee on new users seeking to publish content on the platform. He clarified that this requirement would not affect established members; instead, it targets freshly created profiles during their first three months of existence. After this initial period, new users would regain unrestricted access to all features without additional charges. Although specific figures remain unknown, potential costs may mirror those imposed on new unverified users residing in New Zealand and the Philippines since October 2023. Presently, such individuals must remunerate $1 annually to engage fully with X's services.

Additional Efforts Against Manipulation and Spam

Beyond user fees, X continues combating deceptive practices through regular purges targeting rule-violating accounts associated with spamming and manual platform manipulation. A recent announcement warned users of imminently reduced follower counts due to stringent enforcement efforts aimed at maintaining a safe and authentic environment. By simultaneously pursuing multiple avenues for safeguarding the platform, X demonstrates commitment to preserving meaningful connections between actual people while minimizing interference from nefarious entities.

Harnessing Public Posts for Artificial Intelligence Research

Interestingly, despite Musk's focus on eliminating harmful bots, X amended its policies last year to allow for the utilization of public posts as training data for machine learning algorithms or AI models. Additionally, Musk's own firm, xAI, expressed intentions to employ public posts for model development purposes beginning in mid-2023. Most recently, xAI integrated its Grok chatbot with X's premium offerings, providing select users with enhanced interactive capabilities. Furthermore, reports suggest that X intends to eventually extend Grok's functionality to support broader compositional tasks across the site.

Conclusion

By implementing a nominal fee for new users, enhancing detection methods, purging suspicious accounts, and exploring opportunities afforded by AI technology, X illustrates dedication towards fostering positive interactions amongst its diverse global community. Though questions persist concerning the feasibility and practical implications of these initiatives, one thing remains certain: Elon Musk and X stand committed to cultivating an authentic digital meeting place where creativity flourishes and ideas exchange unfettered by malevolent influences.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-15 18:48:56,"""Fight bots & spam!

Introduction:
In a surprising turn of events, Tesla, the electric vehicle giant, has experienced significant changes as two high-profile executives, Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel, depart from the company on the same day that thousands of employees were laid off. This article will delve into the reasons behind their departures and the current state of Tesla.

Body:
TechCrunch confirmed the departure of Drew Baglino, Teslaâ€™s Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, Vice President of Public Policy and Business Development. Patel revealed to TechCrunch that his decision to leave was due to ""big overall changes"" at the company, which he did not specify. Baglino stated in a post on X that it was a ""difficult decision"" to leave after 18 years at Tesla.

These executives' departures coincide with Tesla's recent layoffs, which aim to cut costs and boost productivity. According to an internal email from CEO Elon Musk, the company is reducing its global headcount by more than 10%. With Tesla employing over 140,000 people at the end of 2023, the cuts could impact more than 14,000 employees.

Musk announced the layoffs just two weeks after Tesla reported its first year-over-year drop in sales in three years, amidst a wider cooling of demand for EVs. The company has warned investors that sales growth could be ""notably lower"" in 2024 than its stated goal of 50% growth each year. Tesla is also in a transitional phase between product cycles, with the expensive Cybertruck recently going into production and the popular Model Y entering its fourth year without any significant updates.

Baglino's departure follows that of Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, who stepped down in August 2023. Baglino oversaw engineering for the company's powertrain and battery technologies and had become one of the more responsive executives on Musk's social media platform.
