In 2024, Lerato Motloung, a mother of two who works in a supermarket in Johannesburg, South Africa, was able to buy her first smartphone thanks to PayJoy, a startup that offers lending to the underserved in emerging markets. Motloung's experience is just one of many that PayJoy has helped since its inception in 2015. The company's mission is to provide fair and responsible entry to the modern financial system, build credit, achieve economic freedom, and provide digital connectivity to individuals in emerging markets.

Unlike other startups offering loans to the underserved, PayJoy is not predatory. Instead, it uses a buy-now-pay-as-you-go model to allow the estimated 3 billion adults globally without credit to purchase smartphones and pay weekly for a 3- to 12-month period. The phones themselves are used as collateral for the loan. PayJoy's loans are interest-free, with no late or hidden fees, and the company marks up the price it charges for the phones by a ""multiple."" However, PayJoy shares the full price upfront before customers sign a contract.

By the fourth quarter of 2023, PayJoy had achieved an annualized run rate of over $300 million, up from $10 million in 2020, when it first introduced lending. PayJoy was also ""net income profitable"" in 2023 and managed to raise significant capital during a challenging fundraising environment. In September 2023, the company announced that it had secured $150 million in Series C equity funding and $210 million in debt financing.

PayJoy has come a long way since TechCrunch first profiled it in December 2015 when it had secured $4.3 million in equity and debt about 10 months after its inception. Today, the company operates in seven countries across regions such as Latin America, India, Africa, and the Philippines, providing over $2 billion of credit to date. In October of 2023, the company launched PayJoy Card in Mexico, providing customers who have successfully repaid their smartphone loans with a revolving line of credit.

PayJoy's success can be attributed to its data-driven approach to underwriting its loans. The company uses data science and machine learning to assess a customer's creditworthiness, enabling cheaper credit and reducing default rates. Over 47% of its customers are women, 40% are new to credit, and 37% are first-time smartphone users.

PayJoy's founder and CEO, Doug Ricketts, was inspired to start the company after serving in the Peace Corps following his graduation from MIT. He then spent two years as a volunteer teacher in West Africa, where he became interested in technology in the context of international development. After the Peace Corps, he landed at Google, where he helped create the world's first complete digital map. Ricketts then moved back to West Africa, where he worked for D.Light Design in the pay-as-you-go solar industry. All of that experience has been combined in PayJoy.

PayJoy is on track to achieve over 35% revenue growth this year, with strong momentum in Brazil and new product offerings in development. The company currently has 1,400 employees and has raised over $400 million in debt and equity over its lifetime. PayJoy's success demonstrates that it is possible to create a profitable business while also making a positive impact on the lives of millions of people around the world.

In conclusion, PayJoy's innovative approach to lending to the underserved in emerging markets has led to significant financial success while also empowering individuals to access modern financial services and digital connectivity. By leveraging data science and machine learning, PayJoy has been able to underwrite its loans more effectively, enabling cheaper credit and reducing default rates. PayJoy's success provides a model for other startups looking to make a positive impact while also generating meaningful revenue.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1257038467.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-11 14:34:12,"""Discover PayJoy: Smartphone Lending for the Underserved.

The Inevitable Evolution of Consumer Technology

In the ever-shifting landscape of consumer technology, nothing is permanent. The realm of tech is a playground for the perpetually unsatisfied, a place where the quest for the next revolutionary product never ceases. The smartphone, a dominant force since the iPhone's debut seventeen years ago, has enjoyed an impressive tenure at the top. Yet, recent times have revealed signs of fatigue in this once-thriving market.

Sales have plateaued and even begun to decline, leading to the worst demand seen in a decade. This downturn has left the tech industry pondering a critical question: what comes after the smartphone era? If a straightforward answer existed, fortunes would be made overnight.

Smartwatches briefly captured the public's attention, but they remain mere complements to the smartphone experience. The AR/VR sector, despite its slow start, still hasn't convinced the masses, with products like Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro under continuous scrutiny.

Enter Humane, a company that burst onto the scene with enigmatic teasers in the summer of 2022, vowing to deliver a future as personable as its name suggests. With over $230 million in funding and a focus on AI, Humane introduced its first product, the Ai Pin, signaling a shift towards a less screen-dependent lifestyle. This device, primarily hands-free, activates with a simple touch and adapts by listening and learning.

A New Era Dawns

Humane's timing couldn't be more opportune. As the excitement over smartphones wanes, the buzz around generative AI surges. The company's credibility, bolstered by founders with Apple pedigrees and support from OpenAI's Sam Altman, has fueled anticipation for its market debut.

Introduction

Venture capitalism (VC) has long been plagued by one significant issue - the scarcity of liquidity. Despite investments in startups or VC funds appreciating in value, there's often little to no actual cash generated for their backers due to the paucity of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This results from the inherent nature of private markets, wherein shares of private companies can't be readily traded like stocks in the public domain. Instead, selling these holdings necessitates approval via secondary sales authorized by the company itself. As growing numbers of early-stage startups face potential undervaluation following the 2021 fundraising craze, an unprecedented chance arises to acquire interests in seed-stage VC funds and startup equity at attractive prices. Enter Cendana Capital and Kline Hill Partners, who have launched a new fund to capitalize on this emerging trend.

A Fresh Investment Opportunity

Co-founded by Michael Kim, Cendana Capital specializes in backing seed-stage venture firms while maintaining strong connections with leading seed funds like Lerer Hippeau, Forerunner Ventures, and Bowery Capital. Meanwhile, Kline Hill Partners focuses on purchasing smaller privately held assets. Their combined efforts culminate in the newly formed $105 million Kline Hill Cendana Partners fund â€“ surpassing the initial target of $75 million.

This innovative fund aims to seize opportunities presented when limited partners seek to offload their commitments, allowing Cendana and Kline Hill to augment their shareholdings in both venture funds and burgeoning startups at reduced costs. Although several challenges accompany these purchases, notably the necessity of specialized knowledge required to evaluate and execute secondary asset acquisitions, joining forces enables both entities to pool resources and access otherwise elusive prospects.

Capitalizing on Market Conditions

In recent times, numerous investors have sought to divest their illiquid positions amidst lingering uncertainty surrounding valuations. Consequently, demand for acquiring such holdings has grown substantially among venture capitalists seeking strategic growth opportunities.

As Michael Kim explained, ""Over the past couple of years, we've consistently heard from our portfolio funds expressing interest in selling their commitments. We saw immense potential in expanding our ownership in these promising ventures and funds at sizable discounts."" However, given the complex nature of assessing and transacting secondary assets, Cendana recognized the benefits of collaborating with experts in the field, thus turning to Kline Hill Partners.

Partnership Synergies

Collaborative advantages abound in this union, particularly regarding deal origination and execution. Leveraging established relationships with seed funds grants Cendana priority access to source prospective secondary deals, subsequently passing them along to Kline Hill for evaluation, negotiation, and pricing. According to Chris Bull, Managing Director at Kline Hill, partnership provides highly valued insights integral to the investment process. Moreover, collaboration facilitates successful completion of transactions that might prove challenging for either entity acting independently.

Conclusion

With increasing demands for liquidity driven by extended private holding periods outlasting typical 10-year fund lifecycles, venture capital is poised for continued transformation. By establishing a niche presence in the secondary market, Cendana and Kline Hill aim to address this pressing concern head-on. Through strategic partnership and meticulous deal selection, these pioneering firms stand to generate considerable returns while simultaneously providing essential exit options for limited partners navigating uncertain waters.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-698155326.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-04-11 16:00:51,"""Seize attractive opportunities with Cendana Capital & Kline Hill's new fund, buying stakes in seed VC funds amid limited liquidity.""

The Intricacies of Bias in AI-Generated Content: A Deep Dive

In the realm of artificial intelligence, the quest for unbiased content generation remains a formidable challenge. A recent study spearheaded by University of Delaware researchers, published in Scientific Reports, has brought this issue into sharp focus. The study, which began in early 2023, sought to understand if AI's large language models, such as the widely recognized ChatGPT, inadvertently produce content that is biased against certain demographics.

The research team, led by Xiao Fang and Ming Zhao of the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, alongside doctoral student Minjia Mao and FSAN program alumni Hongzhe Zhang and Xiaohang Zhao, embarked on a meticulous analysis. They utilized over 8,000 news articles from reputable sources like The New York Times and Reuters as a benchmark to evaluate the AI-generated content. The goal was to compare the AI's output with these established news outlets, known for their careful reporting, to detect any underlying biases.

Their findings were telling. The AI models, including Grover, Cohere, Meta's LLaMa, and various iterations of OpenAI's ChatGPT, exhibited a tendency to produce content with a higher degree of bias, particularly against minority groups. This was not a marginal difference; in some instances, the bias was 40% to 60% more pronounced than in the human-written articles. The researchers also employed sentiment analysis tools to gauge the tone of the language, discovering a consistent skew towards negativity.

One of the most alarming revelations was the ease with which most AI models generated intentionally biased or discriminatory content when prompted. ChatGPT, although significantly better at avoiding such pitfalls, still allowed biased content through its filters on occasion.

The implications of these findings are profound, prompting Fang and his team to delve into the next phase of their research: developing methods to ""debias"" these language models. This endeavor is not just a technical challenge but a moral imperative, as the potential for misuse of AI in spreading harmful biases is a pressing concern.

As we stand on the cusp of an AI-driven future, the study underscores the need for continuous vigilance and improvement in the development of AI technologies. It is a reminder that while AI has the potential to revolutionize our world, it also carries the responsibility to do so ethically and equitably.

Flipboard, a social magazine application originally from the Web 2.0 era, is repositioning itself to take advantage of the resurgence of the open social web. The platform is strengthening its connections with the fediverse, a network of interconnected servers that includes apps like Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and potentially Instagram Threads. The company recently announced an expansion of its fediverse integrations for 400 more Flipboard creators and the introduction of fediverse notifications within the Flipboard app.

The new notifications feature will allow Flipboard users to view their new followers and other activities related to the content they share in the fediverse directly within the Flipboard app. This update follows the integration of Mastodon in the app last year and the addition of support for ActivityPub, the social networking protocol that powers decentralized, open-source networks such as Mastodon and others.

In February, Flipboard announced it would begin adding its creators and their social magazines to the fediverse. This move allowed curated magazines of links and social posts typically shared within the Flipboard app to reach a wider audience. By sharing creators' posts and links with the wider fediverse, Flipboard's publishing partners gained their own native ActivityPub feeds, enabling discovery by Mastodon users and those on other federated social apps. Initially launched with 1,000 Flipboard magazines, this integration now includes an additional 400 magazines, totaling over 11,000 curated Flipboard magazines available to federated social networking users.

Introduction

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has recently announced Avi Wigderson, a renowned computer scientist and mathematician, as the recipient of the 2024 Turing Award. Often regarded as the ""Nobel Prize of computing,"" this prestigious award recognizes Wigderson's fundamental contributions to the Theory of Computation, reshaping our understanding of the role of randomness in computation, and providing decades of intellectual leadership in theoretical computer science. This article delves into Wigderson's groundbreaking work and the implications of his research.

The Theory of Computation and the Role of Randomness

Avi Wigderson has consistently demonstrated a profound understanding of computation as a universal phenomenon. He emphasizes that computation extends beyond mere algorithms in computers, encompassing a wide array of phenomena throughout the universe. Wigderson's perspective on computation is deeply rooted in the work of the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan M. Turing, who laid the foundation for the Theory of Computation in 1936. Turing's landmark paper, ""On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,"" introduced an extensive definition of computation as an evolution of an environment via local, incremental changes.

Wigderson's work has further advanced Turing's ideas, positing that every natural phenomenon is, in essence, computation. From termite castles to starling murmurations, all are examples of computational processes driven by local, incremental changes. Wigderson's most significant contribution, however, lies in his exploration of the role of randomness in computation.

The Power of Randomness in Computation

Conventional computers, such as mainframes and iPhones, operate in a deterministic manner, following a predictable pattern of steps. However, many intriguing examples of computation in nature involve elements of randomness. To tackle this contrast, Wigderson and his collaborators delved into the exploration of randomness, aiming to understand which problems can and cannot be solved efficiently.

In the world of science, math, and engineering, numerous problems lack known efficient algorithms, which can operate in polynomial time rather than exponential time.

This title includes the main points of the article: it's about a study, it mentions Elon Musk, and it connects the platform X (previously Twitter) to profit from hate speech related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. It is concise, informative, and fits under the 50-character limit.","

The Digital Landscape Post-Musk: A Study of Controversy and Profit

In the wake of a legal victory over Elon Musk, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a non-profit organization dedicated to combating online hate, has released a new study. This research delves into the platform known as X, previously Twitter, and Musk's influence on digital discourse. The study reveals a concerning trend: policy changes under Musk's tenure appear to incentivize hate speech by amplifying its reach and monetizing it through X's subscription services.

The CCDH's investigation focused on ten prominent accounts that subscribe to X Premium. These accounts have been disseminating anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric, particularly since the onset of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023. Notably, some of these accounts had a history of spreading COVID-19 conspiracy theories.

The report, titled ""Hate Pays: How X Accounts Are Exploiting the Israel-Gaza Conflict to Grow and Profit,"" tracks the alarming growth of these accounts. It highlights how their follower counts surged following the posting of hateful content. For instance, prior to the conflict, these accounts collectively saw a growth of about 1 million followers. Post-conflict, this number skyrocketed to an additional 4 million followers.

The growth varied among the accounts, with some experiencing a staggering ninefold increase. The report also sheds light on the notorious backgrounds of these account holders, including bans from various platforms and controversial beliefs.

Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022 marked a turning point for the platform. His reversal of bans on accounts known for white supremacist and neo-Nazi affiliations, along with changes in content moderation and account verification policies, has led to a polarized environment. The distinction between truth and falsehood is increasingly blurred, and the platform often veers towards outrage.

The CCDH accuses Musk of deliberately leveraging this outrage for profit. By enabling hate speech purveyors to capitalize on conflict and suffering, X has become a platform where controversy is not just hosted but encouraged for financial gain.

The study also points out that even actions intended to denounce hate speech, such as critical quote tweets, inadvertently increase the visibility and reach of such content. This, in turn, may enhance the potential for revenue generation. The CCDH's findings suggest that up to 28% of the reach of hateful posts can be attributed to such critical engagement.

The presence of advertisements alongside these posts further complicates the issue. Despite Musk's erratic management alienating some advertisers, the CCDH discovered that ads from major brands and even X itself were still being placed near hateful content.

In conclusion, the CCDH's report paints a grim picture of X's current strategy under Musk's ownership. The platform seems to be embracing controversy, with a business model that thrives on user engagement, often at the cost of social harmony.

One such pioneering startup, Voltpost, based in New York City, has developed an ingenious product that retrofits existing street lampposts to facilitate EV charging. After a year of painstaking design and development, Voltpost proudly presented its lamppost chargerâ€”a game-changing innovation destined to reshape urban mobility.

At first glance, this novel charger appears as a protective cover enveloping the bottom portion of the lamppost, housing all necessary electronic components and cabling. Designed to service two to four EVs simultaneously, these Level 2 charging stations may not offer rapid charging; however, they supply ample power for most users to replenish their vehicles overnight.

A significant advantage of Voltpost's system is its user-friendly interface. A docking mechanism securely attaches the charger to the lamppost at an easily reachable height. Meanwhile, the retractable cord features an overhead anchor point eight feet aboveground, keeping it neatly suspended and eliminating tripping hazards. Moreover, the modular construction simplifies maintenance tasks and future upgrades.

Charge station administrators benefit from tailored management software, enabling remote monitoring and controlling pricing structures. As expected, an accompanying smartphone application handles payment processing and reservations for charging sessions. Interestingly, this feature introduces a ""dibs"" or ""savesies"" dynamic among nearby residents, potentially fostering both camaraderie and competition.

Installation speed sets Voltpost apart from competitors, claiming completion in under an hour during a successful trial run conducted alongside the New York City Department of Transportation. With ongoing projects across multiple stages of implementation in major metropolises like New York, Chicago, and Detroit, Voltpost secured a $3.6 million seed investment in July.

In summary, innovations like Voltpost's lamppost chargers bring us one step closer to solving the infrastructure challenges faced by urban EV enthusiasts. By creatively adapting familiar objects around us, we can pave the way towards sustainable transportation options while enhancing community engagement.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/voltpost-curbside-charger.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-11 12:00:10,"Optimized Meta Description:
