Adobe has recently announced the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to generate video content. This new model will be added to Adobe's Premiere Pro, the company's popular video editing suite, later this year. The announcement comes as a response to similar tools such as OpenAI's Sora, Google's Imagen 2, and other startups in the burgeoning generative AI video space.

Adobe's AI Video Features: Object Addition, Removal, and Generative Extend

The new AI model from Adobe will introduce three features to Premiere Pro: object addition, object removal, and generative extend. These features will allow users to select a portion of a video clip and input a prompt to insert objects into that segment, remove unwanted objects, and add a few frames to the beginning or end of a clip for better synchronization with soundtracks or extending shots for emotional impact.

Addressing Deepfake Concerns with Content Credentials

Understandably, concerns about deepfakes arise with the introduction of generative AI tools. Adobe has acknowledged these concerns and announced that it will bring Content Credentials – metadata that identifies AI-generated media – to Premiere Pro. Content Credentials, which are already available in Photoshop and part of Adobe's image-generating Firefly models, will indicate which content was AI-generated and which AI model was used for the generation process.

Data Utilized for Training the AI Model and Compensation

While Adobe remains secretive about the specific data used to train its AI model, recent reports suggest that the company is paying photographers and artists on its stock media platform, Adobe Stock, for submitting short video clips to train the video generation model. This approach differs from Adobe's current arrangement with Adobe Stock artists and photographers, who receive an annual bonus based on content volume and usage.

By potentially paying contributors for their work, Adobe aims to avoid legal issues faced by other companies like OpenAI, which have been accused of violating IP law by training AI models on copyrighted content without proper credit or compensation. Adobe's IP indemnity policy may also help position the company as a reliable and safe option for enterprise customers.

In an unexpected turn of events, some Threads users have reported seeing a new addition to their app – a 'Message' button. However, this feature may not be quite what they had hoped for. Instead of enabling direct messaging (DMs) within the Threads app, tapping the 'Message' button sends a message to an Instagram user. While this update aims to streamline communication between the two Meta-owned platforms, its limitations and assumptions raise questions about convenience and usability.

Originally, using Threads meant connecting through an Instagram account and sharing select data between the two applications. As a result, Threads occasionally borrows functionalities from Instagram, such as this recent messaging capability. According to a Meta representative, this test represents an expansion of the existing function allowing Threads users to forward posts to Instagram. It does not signify the arrival of DMs within the Threads app itself.

The purpose behind the 'Message' button is to facilitate messaging individuals on Instagram directly through Threads, eliminating the necessity to toggle between the two apps constantly. However, given that Threads doesn't offer a standalone messaging inbox, this solution appears less than ideal. Previously, Instagram head Adam Mosseri discussed the difficulties faced when integrating a proper inbox system in Threads. He outlined potential complications arising from either duplicating the Instagram inbox in Threads or developing a distinct Threads inbox altogether. Neither scenario seemed optimal, leaving users wondering whether a satisfactory solution could ever materialize.

Despite good intentions, several concerns accompany this new messaging feature. First, Meta assumes that users maintain consistent friendships and interactions across both platforms. Sending a message via Instagram instead of Threads can lead to confusion among regular Threads users. Second, responding to these messages requires accessing Instagram since replying directly from Threads remains impossible. Lastly, the current state of Instagram's DM feature hardly caters to seamless cross-platform interaction. Further improvements would greatly benefit the overall user experience if Meta intends to fully integrate these two services.

While the concept of merging Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram Direct was once floated around, it now appears unlikely due to regulatory pushback. Nevertheless, Meta continues exploring ways to bridge the gap between various chat experiences under its umbrella. Although the latest update addressing Threads users' desire for DMs might fall short, perhaps future iterations will better meet expectations and deliver a truly integrated messaging service.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d273598145570b7d2074dbe4cba1cc2577f0c264/2024/04/15/c35314d6-755f-4dc3-8cb5-7ce40d18a829/figure-top-threads-testing-direct-messages-but-theres-a-twist.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-15 00:00:00,"""Discover the surprise 'Message' button on Threads!

The iconic New York City skyline holds a special place in the hearts of many, including that of brothers Edi and Etrit Demaj. After fleeing their native Kosovo over two decades ago, the Empire State Building was the first American landmark they saw from the window of their airplane. Little did they know that they would one day contribute to the very same building's efficiency through their latest venture, Kode Labs.

Etrit and Edi founded Kode Labs in 2017 with a vision to revolutionize building management in the cloud era. The brothers aimed to create software capable of integrating and automating various systems in commercial buildings, from air handlers and fire alarms to elevators and EV chargers. Kode Labs' software communicates with over 130 different systems, making it an operating system that seamlessly integrates building functions, much like how a computer's OS integrates various circuit boards.

Commercial buildings may appear clean and harmless, but they contribute significantly to carbon pollution. In the U.S., they generate 16% of all carbon emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. This staggering figure stems from inefficiencies that automation, such as that offered by Kode Labs, can address. By adopting automation, building owners can reduce their carbon footprint and save substantial amounts of money. Project Drawdown estimates that global adoption of automation between 2020 and 2050 could cut carbon emissions by 9.5 to 14 billion metric tons while saving owners at least $2.3 trillion.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced that it will temporarily shut down its Threads app in Turkey from April 29. This decision comes after an interim injunction imposed by the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA) over the way Meta shares data between Threads and Instagram without user consent. This is not the first time Meta has faced regulatory battles in the European region, including a significant fine in the EU for WhatsApp GDPR breaches and being forced to sell Giphy due to reduced competition.

In 2022, Turkey fined Meta $18.6 million for combining user data across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The TCA found that Meta was abusing its dominant market position by merging data of users who create Threads profiles with their Instagram account without giving them the option to opt-in. The TCA also announced that it would issue Meta with an additional $160,000 fine each day for non-compliance with the previous order.

The TCA's investigation revealed that Meta's data accumulation and diverse user base make its services attractive for advertisers, creating an entry barrier in the market. The TCA further stated that Meta operates as an ecosystem, transferring power and knowledge from one service to another, increasing its market power.

Meta's Threads app, launched last summer, required users to create an Instagram account to gain a Threads profile, drawing criticism for forcing users to sign up for both platforms. Initially, the only way to delete a Threads profile was by deleting the entire Instagram account. However, Meta later introduced a separate mechanism for those wishing to delete their Threads profile only.

In response to the TCA's interim injunction, Meta stated that it disagreed with the order and plans to appeal. The company believes it is in compliance with all Turkish legal requirements and intends to bring Threads back to Turkey as quickly as possible. In the meantime, users in Turkey will receive a notification about the impending closure, giving them the option to delete or deactivate their profile. Deactivating a profile means it can be resurrected when and if Threads becomes available in the country again.

Despite being marketed under the 'Pro' label and carrying a hefty price tag, the device faces fierce competition from other established players in the industry. With limited developer backing so far, Apple Vision Pro has yet to gain substantial traction among consumers. Despite these hurdles, many believed that the powerful allure of the Apple brand would maintain interest levels high and sustain discussions revolving around the headset. To date, however, information concerning its adoption rate and user satisfaction remains largely elusive.

Current Standing and Future Potential

While there have certainly been instances of customers returning their Vision Pro units, along with mixed reviews (such as TechCrunch's), this does not necessarily reflect widespread dissatisfaction with the product. It is plausible that numerous individuals continue to enjoy their experiences with the headset despite the less favorable opinions voiced online. Consequently, only time will reveal the true extent of Apple Vision Pro's appeal amongst end-users.

As we look forward, it is crucial for companies including Apple and Meta (with its successful Quest line of VR headsets) to persevere through the existing obstacles to unlock the full potential of AR and VR technology. Presently, computer interfaces often feel antiquated, reminiscent of digital chalkboards rather than seamless visual integrations inherent in cutting-edge face-mounted displays. In order for us to fully embrace this paradigm shift, developers must relentlessly push boundaries towards creating immersive, intuitive, and practical applications across industries.

Conclusion

A group of 23 civil society organizations and non-profits have penned an open letter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), urging them not to endorse Meta's controversial ""consent or pay"" strategy. The letter comes as the EDPB prepares to adopt guidance on this tactic, which forces Facebook and Instagram users to consent to Meta's tracking. The signatories, including EDRi, Access Now, noyb, and Wikimedia Europe, emphasize that this issue is pivotal for the future of data protection and privacy in Europe.

Meta's ""Subscription for no ads"" offer, which was introduced last fall, has been met with numerous complaints and investigations. The European Union recently opened a formal investigation into Meta's use of the pay-or-consent tactic, raising questions about its compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Furthermore, the EDPB's guidance on ""consent or pay"" will provide insight into how the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) should be applied in this context, impacting Meta's assessment under the DMA.

The ""consent or pay"" model has broader implications for the EU's data protection framework, as the EDPB's opinion will apply generally and not specifically target Meta. However, the outcome will significantly affect Meta, potentially making it harder for them to claim compliance with the GDPR or endorsing a model that enables economic coercion for user tracking.

The rights groups behind the open letter, such as noyb, worry that a green light for ""consent or pay"" will result in an influx of apps using similar tactics, undermining the EU's flagship data protection regime. The letter expresses concerns about users facing a binary choice that may not provide a real alternative, potentially leading to ongoing user tracking.

The EDPB's guidance is expected to be pivotal in shaping the future of data protection and privacy in Europe. By carefully considering the arguments presented in the open letter, the EDPB can help ensure that user agency and control over personal information remain at the forefront of data protection regulations.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/meta-brands-glitch.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-15 12:57:16,"""Urge EDPB to Reject Meta's Forced Consent Strategy.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/draftboard-lets-companies-list-referral-bonuses-for-anyone/,Draftboard lets companies list referral bonuses for anyone, Draftboard Platform: Transforming Job Referrals Beyond Employees ,"Title: Draftboard: Revolutionizing Hiring Through Networked Referrals

Imagine a world where anyone could help you find the perfect candidate for a job opening, not just your current employees. This concept forms the basis of Draftboard, a groundbreaking platform founded by Zach Roseman, ex-CEO of Mosaic, a mobile app development group. With Draftboard, businesses can tap into a wider pool of potential hires by offering referral bonuses to individuals outside their organization. Let's delve deeper into the story behind this innovative service.

Traditionally, organizations rely on internal employee referrals when offering such rewards, assuming these individuals possess intimate knowledge about the company culture and required skillsets. However, Draftboard aims to expand this scope by involving external participants in the search for exceptional talents—a shift that promises significant advantages over conventional methods.

Zach Roseman drew inspiration for Draftboard during his tenure at IAC (InterActiveCorp), an American holding company responsible for various well-known consumer brands such as Angie's List, HomeAdvisor, and Match Group. In his capacity as Senior Director of Strategy and Mergers & Acquisitions, Roseman often faced challenges while sourcing fitting candidates for diverse positions. He envisioned leveraging existing referral programs and networking capabilities to streamline the identification of top prospects. Thus, Draftboard emerged as a solution designed to create a compact yet high-quality pipeline of applicants, enabling businesses to expedite their hiring process.

Here's how Draftboard operates: It functions free of charge for enterprises, acting as a mediator between companies and around 1,000 ""scouts"" – Draftboard's term for referrers. These scouts receive updates regarding the progression of referred candidates throughout various stages of corporate recruitment procedures. Scouts accumulate grades based on the caliber of their recommendations, and Draftboard collects a 20% commission fee on each successful referral bonus.

Initially, Draftboard attracted its founding group of scouts primarily through cold calls distributed across multiple platforms, including WhatsApp groups, email lists, LinkedIn, and other online channels. By connecting directly with community leaders and addressing shared concerns, Roseman successfully established relationships with numerous professionals eager to participate in the program. Furthermore, each interaction with potential partner companies resulted in additional connections, as satisfied users enthusiastically recommended fellow colleagues suited for the role of scout.

One may question whether stringent criteria govern the eligibility of becoming a scout. Interestingly, Draftboard adopts a unique approach by refraining from imposing strict prerequisites and instead fostering a data-driven, self-regulating environment. Businesses establish individualized minimum grade thresholds, ensuring only highly qualified scouts contribute to their respective pipelines. Consequently, the responsibility of maintaining performance standards rests solely with the scouts themselves, promoting a healthier competition dynamic among participants.

Some critics argue that Draftboard effectively outsources traditional headhunting tasks without explicitly acknowledging this transformation. Nevertheless, Roseman contends that this notion doesn't accurately reflect the platform's purpose. Rather, Draftboard serves as a catalyst linking referrers with businesses seeking fresh talent. Recruiters constitute a substantial portion of Draftboard's user base, utilizing the platform alongside their primary employment to generate supplementary income streams.

To date, approximately seventy companies have embraced Draftboard as part of their hiring strategies, including notable names such as SeatGeek, Via, and Formlabs. Investors also display strong interest in the venture, having contributed $4.1 million toward its growth at a $13 million valuation. Led by Founder Collective and Twelve Below, these funds will enable New York-based Draftboard to reinforce both aspects of its expanding marketplace – attracting competent scouts and prospective clientele alike.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1397271221.jpg?resize=1200,595",2024-04-15 13:00:10,"Discover Draftboard, the game-changing platform revolutionizing hiring!

Introduction:
In a strategic move aimed at tapping into the vast potential of the Asian market, OpenAI recently announced its expansion into Japan. This development brings exciting news, not only for the tech industry but also for businesses seeking advanced AI solutions tailored to the Japanese language. With a new Tokyo office and plans for a GPT-4 model optimized for Japanese, let's explore what this expansion entails and why it matters.

Body:

Opportunities and Localization
OpenAI recognizes the tremendous opportunities present in Japan, making it a key location for establishing its first Asian office. By doing so, OpenAI demonstrates its commitment to serving diverse markets and catering to unique linguistic requirements. As governmental regulations and societal perspectives evolve regarding AI benefits and challenges, having a physical presence enables OpenAI to navigate these complexities effectively.

Competition and Growth
Despite its strong brand reputation, OpenAI faces competition in Japan. Softbank launched SB Intuitions late last year, aiming to develop native Japanese Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI services. To manage incoming interest and ensure scalability, OpenAI must strategically expand to meet increasing demands. After inaugurating offices in London and Dublin, Tokyo marks its fourth global location, following its headquarters in San Francisco.

Strategic Choices
Japan was chosen for several compelling reasons. Firstly, the nation boasts a rich technological legacy intertwined with innovation and collaboration. Secondly, Japan serves as a crucial player in AI safety initiatives like the G7's Hiroshima AI Process. Moreover, Japan is home to prominent developers and users of AI-driven hardware, presenting valuable growth prospects for OpenAI.

Leadership and Objectives
Understanding the significance of this endeavor, OpenAI appointed Tadao Nagasaki, former AWS leader, as head of OpenAI Japan. His extensive experience leading Amazon's cloud computing operations equips him well to elevate OpenAI's standing amongst enterprises. Among his responsibilities, Nagasaki will establish a local team dedicated to solidifying OpenAI's foothold in Japan.

Notable Enterprises Onboard
Several renowned Japanese companies, including Daikin, Rakuten, and Toyota, utilize OpenAI's enterprise-focused version of ChatGPT, taking advantage of added features such as increased privacy, superior data analytics, and personalization capabilities. Additionally, local governments employ ChatGPT to streamline public services further, enhancing operational efficiency across various sectors.

Language Understanding and Enhanced Performance
While ChatGPT has supported multiple languages, including Japanese, fine-tuning the upcoming GPT-4 model promises deeper insights into the intricacies of the Japanese language. Improved understanding fosters better cultural awareness, enabling highly efficient applications in professional domains—customer support, sales interactions, and content production. Furthermore, OpenAI claims its bespoke model offers boosted performance, ensuring quicker response times and lower costs compared to previous iterations.

Accessibility and Future Plans
Currently, select Japanese businesses enjoy exclusive access to the GPT-4 custom model through OpenAI's invitation system. Gradually, wider availability will unfold over time, allowing more organizations to harness its power via the OpenAI API in the ensuing months.

Conclusion:
With OpenAI's thoughtful approach toward regional expansion, the arrival in Japan represents both a milestone and a promising signal for future developments. Focused investment in leadership, infrastructure, and linguistic adaptation paves the way for success in the competitive landscape. Stay tuned for updates on broader API access to the GPT-4 custom model, unlocking even greater potential for businesses embracing cutting-edge AI technologies.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1647521480-e1694685235777.jpg?resize=1200,676",2024-04-15 09:34:45,"Discover OpenAI's Expansion in Japan: GPT-4 Model Tailored for Japanese Language

Welcome back to our weekly mobility recap, where we cut through the noise to bring you the most important stories in transportation. This week, we're diving into Cruise's return to the robotaxi scene, concerns over Ford's BlueCruise system, and much more.

Cruise Robotaxis Re-enter the Scene, But Not in San Francisco

Cruise, General Motors' self-driving car subsidiary, has announced its robotaxis will resume operations in a surprising location: Phoenix, Arizona. While the company once had a presence in Phoenix and has driven autonomously there since 2020, this move raises questions. Are they starting from scratch, or addressing concerns about the technology? Moreover, Cruise has petitioned California regulators to reinstate its permits for San Francisco operations. Will they remap their hometown or jump back into robotaxi services?

NTSB Investigates Fatal Crash Involving Ford's BlueCruise System

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced it's investigating a fatal crash near Philadelphia involving a Ford Mustang Mach-E with the BlueCruise driver-assistance system active. This comes after a crash in Texas in February, where the driver was using BlueCruise and collided with a stationary car, resulting in the first known fatality related to this system. The NTSB is also looking into another fatal crash in Texas, where BlueCruise may have been active.

Waymo Officially Launches Paid Robotaxi Rides in Los Angeles

Alphabet-owned Waymo has officially started charging for its robotaxi service in Los Angeles. The service is starting small and will scale based on demand and performance metrics. This development comes after California regulators approved Waymo to charge for its robotaxi service in the city.

This revised SEO title incorporates the main points of the article, including the departures of Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel, Tesla's planned layoffs, and the decrease in consumer demand for electric vehicles. By combining several elements into one concise phrase, we create a title that accurately reflects the content while remaining under 50 characters.","Title: Two Senior Executives Leave Tesla Amidst Company Restructuring and Slowing Demand

Introduction:
In a major reshuffle, Tesla sees two of its high-ranking officials leaving the company on the same day it announces massive workforce reduction. Drew Baglino, the Senior Vice President (SVP) of Powertrain and Energy, along with Rohan Patel, the Vice President (VP) of Public Policy and Business Development, have resigned from their positions. These developments follow an earlier report about Tesla planning to lay off more than 10% of its total workforce. Let's delve deeper into the reasons behind these resignations and understand how they fit into Tesla's broader strategy.

Departure Details:
Sources confirmed the departure of Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel from Tesla. While Baglino described his exit as a ""difficult decision"" following 18 successful years at the firm, Patel expressed optimism regarding potential benefits for both himself and Tesla. Notably, Patel served as a special assistant to former U.S. President Barack Obama and advised him on climate change and energy matters before joining Tesla. Both executives received public appreciation from CEO Elon Musk via his social media platform, acknowledging their contributions during their tenures.

Company Downsizing:
These personnel shifts coincide with Tesla's plan to eliminate thousands of jobs worldwide to streamline operations and improve efficiency. According to an internal memo from Elon Musk, approximately 10% of Tesla's global employee base will face layoffs. With over 140,000 employees at the end of last year, this move may affect upwards of 14,000 individuals.

Reasons Behind the Changes:
Recent financial reports indicate a decline in Tesla's sales compared to previous years, resulting in reduced revenue. Furthermore, the broader Electric Vehicle (EV) market seems to be experiencing a slowdown in consumer demand. In response to these challenges, Tesla aims to minimize operational expenses while fostering innovation and agility to maintain competitiveness throughout its upcoming expansion stage.

Impact on Leadership Structure:
Following Baglino's exit, this becomes the second instance of a prominent executive stepping down from Tesla in less than a year. Previously, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Zachary Kirkhorn, vacated his position in August 2023. As Baglino played a crucial role in supervising engineering efforts related to powertrain and battery systems, filling this void remains essential for Tesla's future technological advancements. Similarly, Patel's departure leaves open questions about potential adjustments within Tesla's governmental affairs division.

Conclusion:
Amidst growing concerns surrounding economic downturn and softening demand for EVs, industry leaders like Tesla continue reassessing organizational structures to ensure long-term sustainability and success. Although the simultaneous exits of two senior executives might initially raise eyebrows, such strategic realignments remain commonplace among companies seeking to adapt quickly and effectively to evolving markets. Keep watch for further announcements from Tesla as it navigates through these challenging times.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cybertruck_78.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-15 14:33:20,"Meta Description:
