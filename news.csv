The Future of CTV Advertising: Trends to Watch in 2024

Connected TV (CTV) continues to soar in popularity, offering viewers a convenient and customizable way to consume content. As a result, programmatic platforms are increasingly incorporating CTV advertising into their offerings. However, the CTV ecosystem is constantly evolving, and new trends are shaping its future. Here are some key trends to watch in 2024:

1. The Rise of FAST

Subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) platforms have become more expensive, prompting viewers to seek out free ad-supported streaming (FAST) services. In 2023, over half of viewers in the U.S. used FAST platforms, and this number is expected to grow in 2024. This provides advertisers with new opportunities to reach a wider audience.

2. Shoppable Ads Gain Momentum

Streaming platforms are revolutionizing the way viewers interact with ads. Shoppable ad formats allow viewers to take immediate action, such as buying a product directly from the ad. In 2024, more services are expected to start supporting shoppable ads to enhance viewer experiences and drive sales for marketers.

3. Open Measurement Implementation

Currently, around 17% of ads delivered through CTV devices are played when the TV is off, wasting advertising budgets. To address this, the IAB Tech Lab has released an open measurement SDK that provides enhanced CTV viewability measurement. In 2024, more publishers are expected to integrate this SDK to ensure accurate measurement and prevent wasted spending.

4. Suitability Solutions Enter the Scene

Brand safety is crucial in CTV advertising. Suitability solutions provide advertisers with greater control over where their ads appear, ensuring they are not placed next to objectionable or false content. In 2024, we can expect large publishers to start providing third-party verification providers with video-level data access, enhancing transparency and brand safety.

Benefits for Publishers and Intermediaries

CTV advertising offers publishers a profitable opportunity to generate revenue. By joining programmatic platforms, publishers can automate the ad delivery process and optimize their ad inventory. Ad exchanges and ad networks can also benefit from the growth of CTV by offering diverse ad formats and connecting advertisers with publishers.

Conclusion

The CTV landscape is constantly evolving, presenting both challenges and opportunities for advertisers, publishers, and intermediaries.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/21/the-inevitability-of-internet-monopolies/,The Inevitability Of Internet Monopolies, Google's Waning Search Supremacy: Monopolies and the Erosion of Relevance ,"

The Vanishing Magic of Google: The Fall of Search Engine Supremacy

In the dawn of the internet, Google emerged as a beacon of search excellence, revolutionizing the way we access information. However, over the years, the magic seems to have faded, leaving us with a search engine that prioritizes its own interests over the needs of its users.

The Erosion of Relevance

Initially, Google's algorithm seemed to effortlessly surface the most relevant results, but gradually, this magic began to wane. Ads and Google's own content started to dominate the top of the search results, while the best results were relegated to lower positions.

The Monopoly Problem

Google's dominance in the search market, with over 90% share, has created a monopoly situation. Monopolies, lacking competition, have little incentive to provide exceptional services. Moreover, Google's reliance on advertising revenue exacerbates the problem. As stated by Google's founders themselves, ""The goals of the advertising business model... do not always correspond to providing quality search to users.""

The Value of Networks

The internet's monopolistic tendencies can be attributed to the concept of ""value scaling."" Metcalfe's law suggests that the value of a network grows exponentially with the number of users. This creates a strong incentive for networks to merge, as seen in the consolidation of the internet.

Breaking the Monopoly

While it may seem impossible to challenge the dominance of tech giants like Google, there are steps we can take:

 Explore Alternatives: Venture beyond Google and try out alternative search engines like Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Perplexity AI. These services offer different approaches and features that may enhance your search experience.
 Embrace AI Tools: Utilize new-generation AI tools like Wolfram Alpha for enhanced computational capabilities and answer-focused results.
 Support Government Initiatives: Advocate for government regulations that aim to curb the power of tech monopolies and protect consumer interests.

Conclusion

The fading magic of Google serves as a reminder of the dangers of unchecked monopolies. By embracing alternatives, supporting government initiatives, and holding tech giants accountable, we can restore balance to the digital landscape and ensure that the internet remains a source of unbiased information and innovation.

Glassdoor's Anonymity Breach Raises Concerns

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, has come under fire for allegedly adding users' real names to their profiles without their consent. This has sparked concerns among users who value their anonymity when sharing their experiences on the platform.

Unveiling the Issue

One user, Monica, revealed that Glassdoor added her full name and city to her profile after she contacted customer support via email. Despite never providing this information during her initial sign-up, Glassdoor claimed to have obtained it from her email address.

Monica expressed alarm, fearing that her anonymity could be compromised in the event of a data breach or legal action. She emphasized that Glassdoor's actions violated her privacy and undermined the trust users have in the platform's anonymity.

Glassdoor's Response and User Backlash

Glassdoor maintains that users are ""required"" to have their names on their profiles, but claims that this does not compromise their anonymity regarding past reviews. However, users like Monica argue that their anonymity is at risk if Glassdoor's data is compromised.

The news has caused widespread concern among Glassdoor users, who fear that their own anonymity could be jeopardized. Many have expressed their dismay on social media and news-sharing platforms.

A History of Anonymity

Glassdoor has long been known for allowing users to post reviews anonymously. However, in 2021, the company acquired Fishbowl, a semi-anonymous social network that requires users to verify their identities. As part of the acquisition, Glassdoor signed up all its users for Fishbowl accounts, necessitating a change in its terms of service.

Aaron Mackey, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concern that Glassdoor's latest policies may conflict with its goal of encouraging candid employee reviews. He highlighted the importance of protecting users' anonymity in court cases where employers attempt to unmask their identities.

Discrepancies and Data Collection

In some cases, the information added to users' profiles was inaccurate. Josh Simmons, another Glassdoor user, discovered that his profile contained a mix of correct and incorrect details, suggesting that the data may have been scraped or obtained from a data broker.

Glassdoor's own website acknowledges that it cannot fully confirm the accuracy of user information. This raises questions about the purpose of collecting such data if it cannot be verified.

Limited Options for Users

Users who are concerned about their anonymity have limited options. They can either leave their names on their profiles or delete their accounts entirely. Monica opted for the latter, as she was unwilling to have her name associated with her reviews.

Conclusion

Glassdoor's recent actions have eroded the trust users have in the platform's anonymity. The collection of personal data, coupled with the possibility of data breaches or legal demands, has raised concerns about the privacy and safety of users.

As Glassdoor continues to navigate these issues, it is crucial for the company to prioritize user anonymity and transparency. Users deserve to know how their data is being used and protected, and they should have the option to maintain their privacy if they so choose.

This compromise acknowledges the need to protect jobs and ensure a smooth transition for automakers and workers.

Labor Unions on Board

Labor unions, initially concerned about job losses associated with EV adoption, have expressed support for the revised regulations. The United Auto Workers (UAW) believes the EPA has addressed their concerns, providing a path forward that protects workers while embracing the transition to cleaner technologies.

Benefits for Consumers

The EPA estimates that these new standards will save the average American driver thousands of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of their vehicles. Additionally, the reduction in emissions will lead to cleaner air, preventing premature deaths and improving public health.

A Global Race

President Biden emphasizes that the US will lead the world in developing and manufacturing clean vehicles. By setting these ambitious standards, the US aims to position itself as a hub for innovation and job creation in the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.

The Road Ahead

The transition to electric vehicles presents both challenges and opportunities. Automakers must invest in research and development, while workers must adapt to new skills and technologies. However, the benefits to our planet and our health make this journey imperative.

As we embrace this electric revolution, let us remember that it is not about banning gas-powered vehicles but about creating a sustainable future for generations to come. By working together, we can accelerate the transition to cleaner transportation and build a greener, more prosperous society.

The Art of Storytelling: Crafting a Narrative that Resonates

In the realm of business, storytelling plays a pivotal role in shaping the identity and legacy of brands. From the humble beginnings of Apple to the invention of Gatorade, compelling narratives have the power to evoke emotions, build connections, and leave an enduring impression on consumers.

The Importance of Storytelling in Branding

A well-crafted brand story serves as a roadmap, guiding every aspect of a business's marketing and communication efforts. By infusing your brand's story into every detail, from your website domain to your graphic design choices, you create a cohesive narrative that resonates with your target audience.

Crafting a Narrative that Connects

At the heart of every great brand is a story that captures its ethos, values, and journey. Your task as a marketer or entrepreneur is to identify and articulate this narrative in a way that makes it memorable and relatable.

Authenticity is key. Consumers crave genuine connections with brands that share their values and aspirations. By prioritizing honesty and truth in your storytelling, you build trust and foster brand loyalty.

The Power of Details

The smallest details can make a profound impact on your brand's narrative. From the swoosh in Nike's logo to the simplicity of Cash App's domain name, every element contributes to the richness and memorability of your story.

Choose details that align with your brand's values and unique selling proposition. Consider how these details can be integrated into every aspect of your business, from your website design to your email signatures.

The Role of Digital Identity

In today's digital age, your brand's story extends beyond traditional marketing channels. A domain name that includes keywords before and after the dot, like thrift.store, instantly communicates what your brand offers.

Top-level domains (TLDs) can also enhance your brand's storytelling. A .press domain highlights your public relations initiatives, while a .tech domain emphasizes your digital innovation. The domain you choose becomes an integral part of your brand's narrative.

Consistency: The Key to Memorability

Consistency is the cornerstone of effective storytelling. Ensure that your brand's narrative is woven into every element of your branding, from your logo to your marketing materials. By presenting a cohesive story across all channels, you create a memorable and trustworthy brand experience for your customers.

Conclusion

The art of storytelling in business is a powerful tool for building brands that endure. By crafting a narrative that resonates with your audience, incorporating meaningful details, and maintaining consistency across all touchpoints, you create a brand that stands out, inspires loyalty, and leaves a lasting legacy.

Remember, storytelling is not just about sharing facts; it's about creating an emotional connection that transforms your brand into a symbol of shared values and aspirations. By embracing the art of storytelling, you unlock the potential to build a brand that truly makes a difference in the hearts and minds of your customers.

Protecting Your Brand: A Comprehensive Guide to Domain Name Security

In today's digital landscape, your brand is your most valuable asset. It represents your identity, values, and mission. Protecting your brand from unauthorized use and exploitation is crucial for maintaining its integrity and reputation.

One of the most common threats to brand security is domain name mimicking. This occurs when individuals or organizations register domain names that are similar to your own, often with the intent of diverting traffic or tarnishing your reputation.

How to Safeguard Your Domain Name

To protect your brand from domain name mimicking and other threats, follow these essential steps:

 Register Essential Domain Extensions: Secure all relevant extensions for your brand, including .com, .net, and others that may be relevant to your target audience. This prevents competitors from registering similar domains and siphoning off your traffic.

 Monitor for Brand Siphoning: Regularly check for domain names that are similar to yours or that use variations of your brand name. If you discover any such domains, take immediate action to protect your intellectual property.

 Acquire Competing Domains: If someone else owns the .com extension of your domain, consider acquiring it from them. This ensures that you have complete control over your brand's online presence.

 Avoid Hyphens and Alphanumeric Characters: Domains that use hyphens or alphanumeric characters are more susceptible to exploitation. Keep your domain name short, memorable, and easy to type to minimize the risk of mistyping or confusion.

 Secure Alternate Extensions: Register other extensions that could be used to mimic your domain, such as .es or .co. This prevents nefarious actors from creating confusing or misleading websites that impersonate your brand.

 Choose a Trusted Registrar: Select a domain registrar that is reputable, located in your country, and complies with local laws and regulations. This ensures that your domain is protected from unauthorized transfers or disputes.

 Consult a Domain Expert: A domain name expert can provide valuable guidance on protecting your brand and acquiring premium domain names. They can also assist with stealth acquisition strategies to minimize the cost of acquiring competing domains.

Conclusion

Protecting your brand's domain name is essential for maintaining its integrity and reputation online. By implementing these best practices, you can safeguard your brand from unauthorized use, traffic diversion, and other threats. Remember, your domain name is a valuable asset that deserves the highest level of protection.

Now, developers can purchase top-ups to fetch additional tweets when they reach their limit. For a fee of $100, developers can access approximately 10,000 additional posts. This allows them to continue working without interruption or incurring higher costs.

Limits and Restrictions

While top-ups provide flexibility, there are some limitations. Developers with the basic tier can purchase up to 10 top-ups per month, while those with the Pro tier are capped at 5 top-ups. These limits ensure that developers don't abuse the system and maintain a balance within the API ecosystem.

Impact on Developers

Social Network X's API changes have had a significant impact on the third-party developer ecosystem. Some tools, like Tracy Chou's Block Party, have shifted their focus to other platforms. Additionally, researchers have faced challenges in studying the platform's data due to the API restrictions.

EU Regulations and Access

Despite these limitations, Social Network X has been forced to open up access to researchers in the European Union due to the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA) rules. This highlights the importance of balancing the need for data access with protecting user privacy and platform stability.

Conclusion

Social Network X's new API top-ups provide a valuable solution for developers who need to access more tweets beyond their monthly limits. While there are some restrictions in place, these top-ups offer flexibility and convenience, allowing developers to continue their work without interruption or excessive costs. As the platform continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these changes impact the developer ecosystem and the broader research community.

Combating Food Loss in Kenya: Farm to Feed Leads the Charge

In a world grappling with food scarcity, the staggering amount of food lost or wasted is a sobering reality. Kenya, in particular, faces a significant challenge, with 20-40% of its food production going to waste. Unlike developed nations, where food waste is a primary concern, Kenya's issue lies primarily in food loss.

Small-scale farmers, who contribute a substantial 75% to Kenya's agricultural output, face numerous hurdles. Inadequate market connections and strict cosmetic standards for produce leave them struggling to sell their harvests.

Bridging the Market Gap: The Rise of Farm to Feed

Amidst these challenges, innovative startups are emerging to bridge the market gap for farmers. Farm to Feed, a Kenyan agri-tech company, is a shining example. This startup aggregates farm produce, including imperfect crops that are often rejected by distributors due to their size, shape, or appearance.

Farm to Feed's mission is to connect these farmers with businesses like restaurants and food processors through various sales channels, including an online marketplace. This approach ensures that nutritious food reaches consumers while supporting local farmers.

The Journey of Farm to Feed

Claire Van Enk, Farm to Feed's CEO, co-founded the startup with Anouk Boertien and Zara Benosa in 2021. Their journey began with a non-profit program that provided food to individuals who lost income during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Through this experience, Van Enk witnessed firsthand the abundance of food in Kenya and the glaring lack of market access for farmers. This realization sparked the idea for Farm to Feed, a commercial venture aimed at tackling food loss on a larger scale.

Empowering Farmers, Reducing Food Loss

Farm to Feed's model involves partnering with aggregators who collect produce from farmers in key farming regions. The startup's team then sorts, grades, and dispatches the products to clients from their warehouse in Nairobi.

By purchasing imperfect produce, Farm to Feed reduces food loss and provides farmers with a fair income. Additionally, the startup's data-driven approach helps identify and address the root causes of food loss, leading to improved farming practices and a more sustainable food system.

A Growing Impact

Farm to Feed has made significant strides in its mission. The startup has raised $1 million in funding and expanded its operations, acquiring trucks with sustainable cooling solutions. Its multiple sales channels, including salespersons, a web app, and a WhatsApp chatbot, ensure convenient access for customers.

Innovation in the Food Sector

Farm to Feed is part of a growing movement of startups revolutionizing the food sector in sub-Saharan Africa. These innovators recognize the importance of agriculture to the region's economy and are leveraging technology to address challenges and create opportunities.

Looking Ahead

Farm to Feed's ambitions extend beyond its current operations. The startup is exploring value-addition initiatives to increase revenue streams and create even more value for farmers. Additionally, it is pursuing carbon market opportunities to quantify emission reductions from reducing food loss and waste.

A Sustainable Future for Food

Farm to Feed's mission is not only to reduce food loss but also to create a more sustainable food system. By connecting farmers to markets, empowering them with data, and exploring innovative revenue streams, the startup is paving the way for a future where food is valued, not wasted.
