BLKFAM: A New Streaming Service Championing Black Families

In a world where mainstream media often overlooks or misrepresents Black families, BLKFAM emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a streaming service dedicated to celebrating and uplifting Black culture. With over 1,000 hours of kid-friendly animation, sitcoms, reality shows, fitness programs, and music-driven content, BLKFAM aims to provide a safe and inclusive space for Black families to enjoy wholesome entertainment together.

At the helm of this groundbreaking initiative is none other than the iconic Whoopi Goldberg, serving as both an equity investor and the creative director. Her involvement speaks volumes about BLKFAM's commitment to delivering high-quality content that resonates with Black audiences. With 10 original live-action and animated series in development, BLKFAM promises a steady stream of fresh and engaging stories that reflect the diverse experiences of Black families.

BLKFAM stands as the first and only Black-owned and Black-focused family streaming service, recognizing the need for authentic representation in the media landscape. Black audiences, who consume over 81 hours of media weekly, often feel underrepresented or misrepresented in mainstream content. BLKFAM aims to change that narrative, providing a platform where Black families can see themselves reflected on screen.

Instead of following the ""more is better"" approach of its competitors, BLKFAM curates a carefully selected collection of inclusive stories that spark meaningful conversations and foster a sense of community. Partnering with renowned content providers like Playwatch Kids and Candle Media's ATTN, BLKFAM brings educational shows like ""Kembe,"" ""Gabby Galactic and the Orbiteens,"" and ""12th Street"" to its platform.

BLKFAM's unique co-viewing strategy sets it apart from the crowd. Recognizing that families watch together, BLKFAM offers content that appeals to the entire family, rather than individual age groups. This approach creates shared experiences and strengthens family bonds.

""As a Black parent, I understand the struggle of finding wholesome family co-viewing options,"" says founder Larry Adams, former chief brand officer for HBO Max. ""BLKFAM fills this gap by providing content that is both entertaining and educational, promoting positive values and celebrating Black culture.""

BLKFAM is now available on various platforms, including Amazon Prime Video Channels, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, YouTube TV, Samsung Smart TVs, Vizio, LG, and iOS and Android devices. With its commitment to diversity, inclusivity, and wholesome family entertainment, BLKFAM is poised to revolutionize the streaming landscape and become a beloved destination for Black families everywhere.
