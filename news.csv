Mahbod Moghadam, the colorful co-founder of Genius and Everipedia, as well as an angel investor, passed away last month at the age of 41 due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. The news of his demise surfaced this past weekend, with numerous tributes pouring in on social media platforms, including from former TechCrunch writer-turned-investor Josh Constine.

Moghadam was residing in Los Angeles, working on various projects, one of which was HellaDoge, a short-lived social media platform that rewarded users in dogecoin for contributing dogecoin-related content. His interest in creators' rights and payment methods can be traced back to 2009, following his graduation from Yale and Stanford Law School. After being let go from his first law firm during the economic downturn, he used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman.

Rap Genius, later rebranded as Genius, allowed users to annotate and explain hip-hop lyrics, evolving into a platform where rappers could explain their own lyrics. By 2013, Genius had secured funding from Andreessen Horowitz and expanded its remit beyond hip-hop. However, Moghadam's tenure at Genius was marred by controversial behavior, leading to his resignation in 2014.

Following his departure from Genius, Moghadam co-founded Everipedia, which later became IQ.wiki. During his time at Mucker Capital, he expressed regret that Genius contributors were not compensated for their work on the platform. Despite not reaching the same professional heights as during the early days of Genius, Moghadam remained a beloved figure among Genius's most dedicated fans.

Introduction

The phase-out of nuclear plants in several countries has raised concerns about the future of nuclear power. However, small modular reactor (SMR) manufacturers are optimistic that they can sway skeptical customers with the benefits of carbon-free energy. Despite the cancellation of a next-generation US nuclear plant, there is hope that new SMR projects will become operational by the end of the decade. This article explores the potential of SMRs as a viable carbon-free power source, focusing on recent developments and industry insights.

The Cancellation of NuScale's SMR Project

Late last year, NuScale, a US energy company, announced it was abandoning its small modular reactor (SMR) project in Idaho due to escalating costs. Initially estimated at $5.3 billion, the project's price tag skyrocketed to $9.3 billion, leading to its termination. While this setback may seem disheartening, analysts and industry experts believe that there are positive developments for US nuclear prospects.

SMR Projects in the United States and Canada

GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 SMR design is set to begin producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, in 2029, pending regulatory approval. Construction work is expected to commence in 2025, with the Tennessee Valley Authority also investing in the BWRX-300. Despite the cancellation of NuScale's project, industry experts emphasize that it was a single instance, and improvements in risk sharing are necessary before the industry can build SMRs with repeatability.

Addressing Cost Pressures and Standardization

Some of the reasons for rising costs in nuclear projects are not exclusive to the industry. Higher prices for steel and other commodities, as well as increased uranium prices, contribute to the overall cost. Companies like TerraPower, which is partnering with GE Hitachi, are focusing on innovative ""molten chloride"" technology, aiming to operate at higher temperatures and improve efficiency.

Introduction

The concept of teleoperation, or remotely controlling robots, has opened up a plethora of possibilities for humans to execute various tasks, ranging from the mundane to the complex and even hazardous. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University have recently unveiled an innovative approach, Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), enabling the effective real-time teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. This development brings us one step closer to integrating human cognitive skills with humanoid capabilities, which could revolutionize several industries.

H 2 O: A Scalable Solution

The H 2 O method is a significant departure from previous teleoperation techniques, primarily relying on an RGB camera instead of multiple sensors. This simplified hardware requirement allows for easier scaling and widespread use. The primary objective of this research is to create an accessible and user-friendly teleoperation interface for humanoid robots, enabling the collection of vast datasets of human motions for algorithm development and refining human-robot interactions.

Functionality and Components

The H 2 O teleoperation framework is based on reinforcement learning (RL), facilitating real-time whole-body teleoperation of humanoid robots using a single RGB camera. It comprises several components:

1. Retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities: A novel 'sim-to-data' methodology ensures the feasibility of motions for the humanoid's physical constraints.
2. RL-based motion imitator: This component is trained in simulation using the refined motion dataset and subsequently transferred to the real robot without further adjustments.
3. Reinforcement learning-based model: This model learns new teleoperation policies, enabling the robot to perform a wide array of dynamic whole-body motions in real time.
4. Human motion data cleaning: A crucial step in ensuring the successful replication of motions in robots.

Introduction:

In a move to enhance user experience and rival competing chatbots, social network X has announced that it's rolling out access to xAI's Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers. This decision follows Elon Musk's announcement last month to expand the availability of Grok to more paid users. Let's delve into the details of this exciting update.

Main Content:

Previously, the Grok chatbot was exclusively available to Premium+ users, who paid a monthly fee of $16 or an annual subscription fee of $168. With the recent update, users subscribing to the $8-per-month Premium tier can now interact with the chatbot in select regions. Grok offers two modes for users: Regular mode and Fun mode. As with other Large Language Model (LLM) products, Grok includes labels that indicate when the chatbot might return inaccurate answers.

Earlier this week, social network X introduced a new explore view within Grok, allowing the chatbot to summarize trending news stories. This feature positions Grok as a direct competitor to similar products like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude. Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations in recent months, even going so far as to sue the company in March over what he perceives as a betrayal of its non-profit goal.

Despite open-sourcing Grok last month, xAI has yet to provide details about the training data used for the model. My colleague Devin Coldewey questions whether this is the latest version of the model and if the company will be more transparent about its development approach and training data information.

Grok's Capabilities and Controversies:

Grok not only summarizes news stories but also generates headlines, as seen in a recent example where the chatbot wrote a fake headline stating, ""Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles."" This incident raises questions about the chatbot's accuracy and potential for misinformation.

IN-OFFICE – A Deep Dive

The traditional office setup is undergoing a seismic shift as remote work becomes increasingly popular. In the late 1980s, working from home was a rarity, but today, it has become a sought-after norm for many. According to recent data, 14% of U.S. workers currently work from home full-time, a number that is expected to rise to 20% by 2023. Moreover, 58% of white-collar employees desire flexibility in their work schedules, allowing them to work from home a few days a week.

Nevertheless, the post-pandemic landscape has been fraught with mixed messages regarding the return to the office. Some companies, such as IBM and Amazon, have been pushing hard to get employees back to the office, while others, like Wayfair, have concentrated on remote workers in layoffs. Despite this, many CEOs, including Amazon's Andy Jassy and Tesla's Elon Musk, have expressed reservations about remote work, citing concerns about productivity and the need for in-person collaboration.

However, recent research from the University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business found that return-to-office mandates did not improve firm performance. In fact, such mandates negatively affected employee satisfaction. Furthermore, studies have shown that employees value flexibility over location, suggesting that remote work can lead to higher levels of engagement and productivity.

Karen Mangia, president and chief strategy officer at the Engineered Innovation Group, believes that flexibility is the key to employee satisfaction and productivity. ""Employees who have some degree of flexibility over where and when they work are reporting higher levels of employee engagement and productivity,"" she said. Moreover, companies that force employees to return to the office may face issues related to employee burnout.

Remote work also offers companies access to a more diverse and extensive talent pool than is possible with a traditional in-office setup. Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, noted that companies opening up their hiring to remote workers were finding better candidates than before.

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity, evolving from a niche product to a mainstream staple in home offices during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become household names, offering a multitude of layouts and customizable components. However, as high-end features have become commonplace in budget keyboards, the market has become somewhat stagnant. Enter magnetic switches, a promising innovation set to revolutionize the mechanical keyboard scene.

What sets magnetic switches apart is their ability to quickly change the actuation point, or the point during the keypress where the switch registers your downstroke. Traditional mechanical switches rely on a physical connection to close an electrical circuit, while magnetic switches utilize magnets and springs, activating by sensing changes in the magnetic field. This technology, popularized by Dutch keyboard startup Wooting, has the potential to transform the way we interact with mechanical keyboards.

The Hall Effect

Magnetic switches operate using the Hall Effect, a principle discovered in the 19th century. When a magnetic field is applied to a current-carrying conductor, a voltage proportional to the magnetic field is produced perpendicular to the current flow. In magnetic switches, a permanent magnet is placed in the stem, and as the key is pressed, the sensor on the keyboard's PCB detects the change in the magnetic field. This change allows for a more precise and adaptable actuation point.

Customizable Actuation Points

One of the most significant advantages of magnetic switches is the ability to customize the actuation point. For gamers, a lower actuation point can provide a competitive edge, allowing for faster response times. For typists, a higher actuation point can prevent accidental keypresses and improve typing accuracy. This adjustment can be made through simple key combinations on the keyboard or through manufacturer-provided software tools.

Furthermore, magnetic switches enable the customization of release points, which can be beneficial for gamers looking to quickly spam keys or create unique macros. With this high degree of customization, users can experiment with their favorite settings without having to physically change switches.

Drawbacks and Limitations
