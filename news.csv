https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/cleanfiber-series-b-fundraise/,CleanFiber wants to turn millions of tons of cardboard boxes into insulation," CleanFiber Transforms Cardboard Waste into Insulation, Secures $60M Funding ","Title: Revolutionizing Insulation: CleanFiber's Quest to Recycle Corrugated Cardboard

Introduction

In today's world, where environmental consciousness takes center stage, businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to reduce their carbon footprints and repurpose waste materials. One such innovation comes from CleanFiber, which transformed the insulation industry by creating an alternative to traditional cellulose insulation derived from old newspaper scraps. As the demand for newspapers decreases and the volume of corrugated cardboard increases due to surging e-commerce sales, CleanFiber saw an opportunity. This article explores how CleanFiber tackled challenges associated with repurposing cardboard waste into high-quality insulation and secured substantial funding to fuel its growth plans.

The Challenge: From Newspaper to Contaminated Cardboard

Cellulose insulation manufacturers relied heavily on discarded newspapers for many years; however, this source became less reliable as print media waned in popularity. Meanwhile, corrugated cardboard usage grew exponentially—a staggering 50 million tons end up in recycling bins annually. Although seemingly ideal for producing insulation, these cardboard boxes contained numerous impurities like plastic tape, shipping labels, and metal staples, complicating efforts to recycle them effectively.

Addressing the Problem

Recognizing this emerging issue, CleanFiber dedicated time and resources to develop methods for converting corrugated cardboard into viable insulation alternatives. Despite facing hurdles initially, they successfully developed a novel approach capable of turning various paper-based products into a substitute for conventional cellulose insulation without compromising performance or increasing costs.

Securing Funding for Expansion

Having proven its concept, CleanFiber attracted investment from several organizations committed to sustainable practices. Lead investor Spring Lane Capital contributed $28 million through a Series B round along with a $31.5 million project financing facility. Additional investors include Ahlström Invest, AXA Investment Managers, Climate Innovation Capital, and Tokyu Construction/Global Brain. With fresh funds totaling nearly $60 million, CleanFiber aims to bolster its presence across the United States and strengthen its foothold within the competitive insulation market, valued at $12.5 billion.

Overcoming Technological Hurdles

Creating insulation from previously untapped feedstocks presented unique obstacles, including ensuring compatibility with current installation processes and keeping production expenses under control. By iteratively improving its manufacturing techniques, CleanFiber managed to lower marginal production costs significantly while maintaining the quality demanded by installers accustomed to traditional cellulose insulation.

Building Momentum

Now operating a fully functional flagship plant, CleanFiber demonstrated the viability of its business model and laid solid groundwork for future expansions. While constructing new facilities may still present certain difficulties, subsequent projects will likely encounter fewer complexities. Moreover, stricter energy efficiency regulations requiring increased home insulation levels play right into CleanFiber's hands, setting the stage for continued success as the company scales operations and captures greater market share.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1473956104.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-12 14:30:40,"""Transform Cardboard Waste into Insulation: Join CleanFiber's Sustainable Revolution. $60M funding secured.""", Recycled Cardboard ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Tesla has recently announced a significant price reduction for its advanced driver assistance system, Full Self-Driving (FSD), bringing the monthly subscription cost down from $199 to just $99. This move comes as part of Tesla's strategy to accelerate FSD adoption before its first-quarter earnings. The price cut follows the introduction of a free one-month FSD trial for all eligible Tesla customers in the United States.

Originally known as FSD Beta, Tesla has rebranded the software as ""Supervised FSD"" to emphasize that the system still requires human supervision, despite its advanced capabilities.

The improv comedians, part of Dropout's Dungeons & Dragons actual play show Dimension 20, have managed to sell out a 19,000-seat venue, causing a stir in the D&D community.

The excitement, however, is tempered by the frustration directed at Ticketmaster. The dynamic pricing system, which causes ticket prices to increase as more people try to buy them, has led to upper bowl tickets being priced at $800 just an hour after going on sale. This has left fans feeling understandably upset, especially since the show's content is overtly anti-capitalist.

Despite the pricing debacle, the demand for the show is a positive sign for both actual play shows and the creator economy. Shows like Dimension 20 and Critical Role, which recently sold out a 12,500-seat venue at Wembley, demonstrate the growing popularity of this genre. Ten years ago, such pop star-sized productions for online creators would have been unthinkable.

Dropout, the production company behind Dimension 20, exemplifies the changing tides in the entertainment industry. When CollegeHumor folded, one of the company's executives, Sam Reich, acquired the company, which has since evolved into Dropout. Dropout now produces a variety of comedy shows, including Dimension 20, and has a cast of comedians who are as compelling as the shows themselves.

The success of Dimension 20 is a testament to the fact that the relationship between Silicon Valley and the creator economy hype cycle is irrelevant to the actual careers of creators. Despite the decline in venture funding for creator companies, creators can still sell out Madison Square Garden, proving that their success is not dependent on external factors.

In conclusion, while the frustration with Ticketmaster is understandable, the success of Dimension 20 is a positive sign for the creator economy. The demand for actual play shows and the ability of creators to sell out large venues demonstrate the growing popularity of this genre and the potential for creators to achieve success on their own terms.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dimension20-msg.jpg?resize=1200,810",2024-04-12 17:30:41,"""Dimension 20 sells out MSG, proving the power of actual play shows in the creator economy.""

In the era of AI, data has become the new oil. Companies are licensing data from brokers to train more capable and legally defensible AI-powered products. However, the individual creators and owners of this data rarely see any financial benefit. Enter Vana, a startup co-founded by Anna Kazlauskas and Art Abal in 2021, with a mission to change this narrative.

Anna Kazlauskas, a computer science and economics graduate from MIT, and Art Abal, a corporate lawyer turned impact sourcing expert, have joined forces to create a platform that lets users ""pool"" their data for generative AI model training. This data can include chats, speech recordings, and photos, enabling the creation of personalized experiences such as daily motivational voicemails or art-generating apps tailored to individual style preferences.

Vana's infrastructure empowers users to create a data treasury, allowing them to aggregate personal data in a non-custodial way. Users can own AI models and use their data across various applications. The Vana API enables developers to connect users' cross-platform personal data, simplifying onboarding and eliminating compute cost concerns.

But why would users trust an anonymous startup with their personal information in this age of increased data privacy awareness and ransomware attacks? To address these concerns, Vana ensures users have the option to self-host their data and control how it's shared with apps and developers. Vana generates revenue through monthly subscriptions (starting at $3.99) and data transaction fees, disincentivizing the exploitation of user data.

Vana's ultimate goal is to create a user-owned data ecosystem, where users can bring their data and models with them to any application. To facilitate this, Vana has launched the Reddit Data DAO (Digital Autonomous Organization). This program pools multiple users' Reddit data, including karma and post history, and allows them to decide how the combined data is used. Users can license their combined data to generative AI companies for a shared profit, democratizing the data economy.

Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity has become paramount for businesses worldwide. Recently, there have been whispers surrounding the possible acquisition of API protection startup, Noname Security, by Akamai Technologies for $500 million. Although this figure represents a considerable reduction from its previous $1 billion evaluation, the implications of such a transaction extend beyond financial considerations, influencing both the involved parties and the broader cybersecurity sector. This article aims to analyze the situation while offering insights into the driving forces behind these developments.

About Noname Security & Its Founders

Co-founded in 2020 by Oz Golan and Shay Levi, Noname Security specializes in safeguarding Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) against cyber threats. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, yet rooted in Israel, the firm attracted $220 million in venture investments since its inception. Notable backers include Insight Partners, ForgePoint Capital, Cyberstarts, Next47, and The Syndicate Group. Most recently, Noname secured a $135 million investment led by Georgian and Lightspeed in late 2021, which brought its total funding to over $350 million.

Current State of Negotiations

According to inside sources, Noname Security is presently engaged in advanced discussions with Akamai Technologies regarding a prospective acquisition worth around $500 million – significantly less than its latest $1 billion valuation. However, it's important to note that deals often undergo changes before completion or may even fall through entirely. Despite the reduced selling price, those who joined Noname during earlier stages can anticipate substantial returns, whereas later-stage investors might achieve complete recovery of their initial investments without realizing the desired profits of 2021's bullish period.

Valuing Noname Security

This proposed acquisition evaluates Noname Security at roughly fifteen times its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Should the deal proceed successfully, Akamai expects to inherit Noname Security's workforce comprising nearly 200 employees. At present, neither party has publicly commented on the matter; however, given the ongoing discussion, further updates seem imminent.

Industry Context & Future Outlook

Within the technology sphere, numerous startups face challenges due to plummeting valuations following US Federal Reserve rate increases. Consequently, various ventures explore multiple avenues concurrently—seeking both acquirers and additional funding rounds, also known as a ""dual-track"" approach. Furthermore, many growth-oriented VC firms eagerly await exit opportunities amidst a protracted Initial Public Offering (IPO) drought. Thus, experts predict intensified Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) activities in the event of continued IPO stagnation.

Conclusion

Ultimately, the potential union between Noname Security and Akamai Technologies embodies just one instance among countless others unfolding across the dynamic cybersecurity landscape. Regardless of whether this particular agreement culminates in successful integration or fades away silently, similar scenarios promise to surface repeatedly throughout the ever-changing tech ecosystem.
