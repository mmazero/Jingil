Introduction

The prospect of effectively operating robots from a distance, or teleoperation, has opened up a world of possibilities. This technology could allow humans to accomplish a wide range of manual tasks remotely, including hazardous and intricate procedures. Moreover, teleoperation could be employed to amass datasets of human motions, which could aid in training humanoid robots to perform new tasks. Recently, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University introduced Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), a real-time whole-body teleoperation system for human-sized humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. This groundbreaking approach could enable the training of humanoid robots in various manual tasks requiring specific sets of movements, such as playing sports or moving boxes.

The Challenge of Teleoperation

Before humanoid robots can fully integrate with human capabilities, an interface between humans and humanoid robots must be established for data collection and algorithm development. H 2 O, presented in a paper on the arXiv preprint server, takes the first crucial step by introducing a real-time whole-body teleoperation system using a single RGB camera. This innovative framework facilitates the precise teleoperation of humanoid robots in real-world tasks.

A Scalable Solution

In contrast to previous methods, H 2 O relies solely on an RGB camera, making it easily scalable and widely applicable. The researchers aim to create a user-friendly teleoperation system that can collect and scale up data for humanoid robots. Inspired by prior works addressing various aspects of this challenge, such as physics-based animation of human motions, transferring human motions to real-world humanoids, and teleoperation of humanoids, this study aims to combine these components into a unified framework.

How H 2 O Teleoperation Works

H 2 O teleoperation is based on reinforcement learning (RL) and facilitates real-time whole-body teleoperation of humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. The process begins with retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities through a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints. The refined motion dataset then trains an RL-based",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-scalable-reinforceme.jpg,2024-04-06 08:30:01,"Meta Description: ""Discover Human2HumanOid, a real-time whole-body teleoperation system for humanoid robots using only an RGB camera.

Instagram Threads, Meta's attempt to challenge Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter), has yet to find its moment in the spotlight. On Friday, as the East Coast experienced an earthquake, users turned to X to discuss the event, with earthquake quickly becoming a top trend. However, Threads only began to register earthquake-related terms closer to 2 p.m. ET, several hours after the earthquake hit.

Despite the delayed reaction, conversations about the earthquake were happening on Threads, with users tagging their discussions as EarthquakeThreads or NYC Threads. However, the absence of hashtags on Threads, unlike X, may contribute to the confusion. Users are experimenting with tagging conventions like ""[term] Threads,"" making it difficult to establish a unified trending topic.

When questioned, Instagram stated that Threads' top trends are based on various signals, including the number of people talking about a topic and engaging with related posts. Since the earthquake was a regional event, it might have taken more time for enough people to join the conversation, given that trends are based on national conversations. Nevertheless, this delay could harm Threads' ability to compete with X in real-time trending topics.

Meta's plan to distance itself from political content discussions may further limit Threads' potential. The platform's focus on building features like reposts, search, bookmarks, and linkable tags is commendable, but it may not be enough to surpass X's dominance, especially in delivering real-time information and hosting active topical discussions.

Twitter, which has remained ""stickier"" than anticipated, experienced its breakthrough moment during the San Francisco earthquake in 2006. Co-founder Jack Dorsey observed how users shared their earthquake experiences on the platform, creating a sense of unity. Threads, with its 130 million monthly active users, still has some way to go in providing a similar experience.

However, Threads faces criticism for its seemingly random post selection in users' For You feeds. Critics like Max Read have described the platform as the ""gas-leak social network,"" raising questions about its ability to deliver a coherent and engaging user experience.

""The more successful things are, the more risk-averse people become,"" Pichai explains. ""Larger organizations, including universities and companies, tend to default to being more cautious. It's essential to push teams to take risks and challenge themselves.""

To promote risk-taking, Pichai believes in rewarding effort and good execution rather than focusing solely on outcomes. This approach encourages employees to take calculated risks and learn from their experiences. Google has even reintroduced a Google Labs-like initiative, making it easier for employees to prototype and experiment with new ideas.

AI Advancements in 2023

Pichai shared two AI advancements he's most excited about in 2023. First, the multimodality of Google's latest LLM (Language Learning Model) allows it to process different types of inputs, such as video and text, simultaneously. This capability, Pichai notes, is ""mind-blowing"" and has the potential to revolutionize various industries.

Second, the ability to chain discrete answers together will enable the creation of smarter workflows. This development will allow users to tackle complex tasks and workflows more efficiently. Pichai humorously suggested that this technology could make administrative tasks like managing billing systems at a university hospital easier.

Eric Liaw of IVP: Insights on Fundraising, Succession, and Portfolio Companies","Title: A Candid Conversation with Eric Liaw of IVP: Fundraising, Succession, and Portfolio Insights

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of venture capital, IVP has consistently made its mark by investing in growth-stage companies. The firm's recent closing of its 18th fund, with $1.6 billion in capital commitments, is a testament to its reputation and success. I had the opportunity to speak with Eric Liaw, a longtime general partner at IVP, to discuss the fundraising process, succession, and portfolio companies, including Klarna and the French social network, BeReal.

Fundraising in a Choppy Market

When asked about the fundraising process, Liaw acknowledged the challenges presented by the current market. ""It's really been a choppy period throughout,"" he admitted. Despite the fluctuations, IVP has remained consistent in its approach, raising a ""slightly bigger"" fund in 2021 but avoiding overcapitalization and rapid deployment, which Liaw noted was a pitfall for some firms in the industry.

Expansion to Europe and the Klarna Drama

Liaw, who has relocated to London, discussed IVP's expansion to Europe as an organic extension of its existing strategy. The firm made its first European investment in 2006 and now boasts a portfolio of approximately 20 European companies, which account for 20% of its active portfolio.

Regarding the recent drama surrounding Klarna, Liaw shared that IVP is a smaller investor and not actively involved in board discussions. While expressing excitement about Klarna's business performance, Liaw acknowledged the challenges of being a publicly filing company without the currency enjoyed by publicly traded companies.

The French Social Network, BeReal

Turning to the topic of consumer startups, Liaw and I discussed the French social network, BeReal, which is reportedly seeking Series C funding or considering a sale. Although IVP has researched and spoken with BeReal in the past, Liaw shared that they are not currently investors, noting that social is a challenging space with a tough path to success. However, he also acknowledged the potential for companies to establish a foothold, citing Snap, Discord, and TikTok as examples.

","Title: Tesla's Robotaxi Arrives Amidst Speculation on Affordable EV Plans

Introduction

In a recent announcement, Tesla unveiled plans to introduce a robotaxi on August 8, as confirmed by CEO Elon Musk via Twitter. This revelation follows a report by Reuters suggesting that the automaker has abandoned its plans to develop a low-cost electric vehicle (EV). However, Musk has since dismissed these claims as false, maintaining that Tesla remains committed to producing a more affordable EV, with a target price of $25,000.

The Core Message

Tesla's focus on robotaxis, coupled with its ongoing commitment to an affordable EV model, raises questions about the company's strategy in the rapidly evolving market for sustainable transportation. This article explores the implications of Tesla's robotaxi announcement and the denial of the low-cost EV cancellation.

Tesla's Robotaxi Plans

Elon Musk's announcement of the robotaxi comes just hours after Reuters reported that Tesla was canceling its plans for an affordable EV. Musk's confirmation of the robotaxi suggests that the company is redirecting its resources and efforts towards this new venture. However, it remains unclear how Tesla intends to integrate its camera-only system into the robotaxi, given that rival companies rely heavily on radar and other sensors for their driver assistance technologies.

Addressing the Controversy

In response to Reuters' report, Musk took to Twitter to accuse the news organization of lying, without specifying which part of the article he considered to be false. Given his subsequent confirmation of the robotaxi, it can be inferred that Musk disagreed with the claim that Tesla had canceled its more affordable EV plans.

Tesla's Commitment to an Affordable EV

Despite the controversy, Musk has reiterated his optimism regarding the production of a $25,000 EV, which he expects to be available in the second half of 2025. Currently, Tesla's most budget-friendly vehicle is the Model 3, with a starting price of $39,000.
