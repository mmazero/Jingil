In the world of AI, generative AI is the latest buzzword. It's a powerful technology that enables machines to generate new content that's similar to human-generated content. The potential of generative AI for the enterprise is enormous, but it requires the right infrastructure and tools to unleash its power.

That's where OctoAI comes in. OctoAI is a Seattle-based startup that's on a mission to make AI more accessible and useful for businesses. Their latest offering, OctoStack, is an exciting new platform that enables companies to deploy private generative AI models.

OctoStack is a turn-key production platform that companies can use in a virtual private cloud or on-premises. It provides highly optimized inference, model customization, and asset management. With OctoStack, companies have the freedom to build and run gen AI applications in the way that makes the most sense for their business.

One of the key features of OctoStack is its support for fine-tuning and deployment of a range of open source and commercial AI models. This includes popular models like Meta's Llama family, Mistral's 8x8B, and Stable Diffusion models. However, OctoStack doesn't include Anthropic's Claude, which is only offered in the cloud via Anthropic.

OctoStack is not just a fully managed solution like OctoAI's self-optimizing infrastructure service. It's a self-managed offering that gives companies more control over their AI applications. With OctoStack, companies can choose their model, customize their models, and offer that as a totally private API. OctoAI provides all the infrastructure for it, ensuring that the model becomes reliable and efficient across GPUs.

The potential market for enterprise AI is enormous. According to a Menlo Ventures report, $400 billion was spent on cloud software in this space last year, with $70 billion of that investment going to AI. Generative AI made up just $2.5 billion, less than 1% of the total investment.

However, enterprise investment in generative AI is still small compared to enterprise budgets for traditional AI and cloud software. According to Amalgam Insights, over half of CIOs have some plans to formally deploy Generative AI, and the popularity of services and models such as Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and many others is increasing. However, the capabilities associated with customization, fine-tuning, and augmenting models is still low, which is where OctoAI's OctoStack comes in.

OctoStack is a good thing because it enables companies to have all the stack in one place. It's easier to deploy and manage AI applications with OctoStack, ensuring that companies can reap the benefits of generative AI without the complexities of managing multiple tools and frameworks.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, tackling increasingly complex tasks. However, the energy consumption of today's electronic deep neural networks poses a significant barrier to their widespread use, particularly in edge systems. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring next-generation computing modalities, such as photonic computing, which could enhance energy efficiency, processing speed, and computational throughput.

Although photonic computing holds great promise, existing optic neural networks (ONNs) suffer from ""catastrophic forgetting,"" struggling to perform even simple, single-task learning. This limitation stems from the fact that these networks are trained using conventional computing systems, which often result in new models interfering with previously learned knowledge. Consequently, the network rapidly forgets expertise gained from earlier tasks when presented with new information, leading to poor network capacity and scalability for multi-task learning.

In a groundbreaking study published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of scientists led by Professor Lu Fang from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, introduced L2ONN, a reconfigurable photonic computing architecture designed for lifelong learning. L2ONN harnesses the unique characteristics of light, spatial sparsity, and multi-spectrum parallelism, enabling ONNs with lifelong learning capabilities. Unlike conventional ONNs that mimic artificial neural network (ANN) structures, L2ONN's photonic lifelong learning is initially designed based on the physical nature of light-matter interaction, allowing it to fully exploit the functional and performance potentials of wave optics in photonic computing.

The L2ONN architecture demonstrates remarkable learning capabilities across various environments, excelling in challenging tens-of-tasks, such as vision classification, voice recognition, and medical diagnosis. It achieves up to 14 times larger capacity than existing optical neural networks, with energy efficiency an order of magnitude higher than representative electronic artificial neural networks.

The L2ONN architecture draws inspiration from the human brain's unique ability to incrementally absorb, learn, and memorize knowledge. Neurons and synapses perform tasks only when required, relying on sparse neuron connectivity and parallelly task-driven neurocognition mechanisms to consolid",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/photonic-neuromorphic.jpg,2024-04-03 11:03:26,"Meta Description:

Introduction

In the vast and ever-fascinating world of biology, there are creatures that never cease to amaze us with their unique abilities. One such creature is the Chinese rice grasshopper (Oxya chinensis), which has garnered the attention of biologists, materials scientists, and bionics specialists alike at Kiel University's Institute of Zoology. These tiny creatures have been found to possess extraordinary abilities when it comes to moving on varied terrain, including the surface of water. In a collaborative effort with researchers from China, Professor Stanislav N. Gorb and his team have delved into the remarkable world of these aquatic acrobats, with their findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The Aquatic Acrobatics: Jumping and Swimming

The Chinese rice grasshopper is a common sight in China's rice-growing regions, particularly along the Yangtze River. These creatures have adapted exceptionally well to their environment, displaying an uncanny ability to perform aquatic acrobatics with remarkable ease. Whether they are jumping or swimming on the water's surface, the grasshoppers exhibit an impressive combination of static and dynamic forces that enable them to move with agility and speed.

To study these aquatic acrobatics in detail, Gorb and his team conducted an experiment involving 15 grasshoppers with varying body lengths and weights. The grasshoppers were introduced to a glass tank filled with water, and their movements were captured using high-speed cameras. The researchers subsequently analyzed the mechanisms utilized by the grasshoppers to generate forces that facilitate their water acrobatics.

The Science Behind the Acrobatics

Force measurements and model analyses revealed that body weight support through hydrostatic pressure is achieved proportionally to the mass of the grasshoppers, while motion drives are derived from controlled interactions between limbs and water (i.e., hydrodynamics). This combination of static and dynamic forces enables the grasshoppers to move with remarkable agility and speed on the water's surface.

However, the energy consumption required to power these systems is becoming a growing concern. A study by computer science researchers at the University of Copenhagen has shown that it is possible to develop AI models that are energy efficient and thus more environmentally friendly.

Assistant Professor Raghavendra Selvan, one of the study's authors, highlights the importance of considering energy efficiency in the development of AI models. ""Today, developers are narrowly focused on building AI models that are effective in terms of their accuracy. But this often comes at the expense of energy consumption. As a result, AI models can be inefficient in their use of energy. Our study shows that it is possible to develop AI models that are energy efficient and still perform at a high level,"" says Selvan.

The researchers calculated the energy usage required to train over 400,000 convolutional neural network (CNN) models, a type of AI commonly used for image analysis, natural language processing, and object recognition. They found that it is possible to reduce the energy usage required to train these models by up to 70-80% without compromising on performance.

This benchmark collection of energy-efficient models can serve as a recipe book for AI professionals, allowing them to choose a model that balances both performance and energy consumption. This approach can lead to more sustainable and responsible AI development, allowing us to harness the power of AI while minimizing its impact on the environment.

""AI has amazing potential. But if we are to ensure sustainable and responsible AI development, we need a more holistic approach that not only has model performance in mind but also climate impact. Here, we show that it is possible to find a better trade-off. When AI models are developed for different tasks, energy efficiency ought to be a fixed criterion—just as it is standard in many other industries,"" concludes Selvan.

As AI continues to play a larger role in our lives, it is essential that we prioritize energy efficiency in its development. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of AI while minimizing its impact on the environment.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/computer-scientists-sh.jpg,2024-04-03 14:34:04,Reduce AI energy consumption by 70-80% with energy-efficient models.

As you get closer, you notice that the plants are growing on a special type of glass. The glass has a silica nanoparticle coating, which is what's allowing the plants to grow so quickly. You also notice that the glass is emitting UV light, which is why the plants are growing so well.

But what exactly is this glass, and how does it work?

The glass is called UV-emitting glass, and it's a new type of glass that has been developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The researchers have discovered that by adding a silica nanoparticle coating to the glass, they can enhance its ability to emit UV light, which can then be used to disinfect surfaces and inhibit the growth of biofilm.

Biofilm is a layer of microorganisms that forms on wet surfaces, and it can be found in a wide range of environments, from the ocean to the human body. Biofilm can cause problems in many different ways, from clogging pipes and reducing the efficiency of water treatment plants to causing health problems in humans.

The UV-emitting glass developed by the researchers at UMass Amherst is a promising solution to these problems. By emitting UV light, the glass can kill the microorganisms that make up the biofilm, and by having a silica nanoparticle coating, it can also prevent the formation of new biofilm.

One of the key advantages of the UV-emitting glass is that it can be used in a wide range of applications. For example, it could be used to disinfect the windows of ships and other watercraft, or to prevent the growth of biofilm on medical equipment like endoscopes and catheters.

The researchers have already demonstrated the effectiveness of the UV-emitting glass in several experiments, and they are excited about the potential applications of their discovery. ""This technology could revolutionize the way we disinfect surfaces and prevent the growth of biofilm in many different environments,"" says Mariana Lanzarini-Lopes, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at UMass Amherst and the lead researcher on the project.

Of course, like any new technology, there are still many questions to be answered about the UV-emitting glass. For example, we need to know more about how long the glass will be effective at disinfecting surfaces and preventing the growth of biofilm, and we need to find out if there are any potential negative side effects to using the glass.

But overall, the potential benefits of the UV-emitting glass are enormous, and the researchers at UMass Amherst are excited to see where their discovery will take them. ""This is just the beginning of a new era in disinfection and biofilm prevention,"" says Lanzarini-Lopes. ""And with the UV-emitting glass, we have a powerful tool at our disposal to help us overcome some of the biggest challenges facing us today.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-team-creates-3.jpg,2024-04-02 16:32:33,Experience the power of UV-emitting glass for disinfection and biofilm prevention.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scientists-amorphous-flexible-mini-inductor.html,Scientists develop novel amorphous flexible mini-inductor,Amorphous Flexible Mini-inductor for High Inductance Density in Electronic Devices.,"

Are you tired of dealing with stiff and heavy inductors that take up too much space in your electronic devices? Well, a new study by a team of Chinese researchers has developed a solution that could change everything. They have created a flexible mini-inductor made of amorphous alloys that is both highly flexible and has a high inductance density.

Flexible mini-inductors are crucial in power conversion and signal processing, but conventional coils made of non-magnetic materials tend to cause magnetic leakage, which reduces the inductance density and makes them unsuitable for low-frequency applications. However, the use of amorphous soft magnetic alloys as coil materials can help overcome this problem.

Prof. Wang Junqiang's team at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences used high-precision femtosecond laser ablation technology to precisely craft amorphous alloy ribbons that maintain their intrinsic mechanical excellence without inducing crystallization. The resulting amorphous flexible mini-inductor has a high permeability and significantly reduces magnetic leakage to less than 10-4 T, which minimizes interference between electronic components.

The inductance density of the device increases to about 280-390 nH/mm2, which is about 10 times higher than that of conventional planar inductors. Moreover, the amorphous structure of the device provides excellent mechanical flexibility, which allows it to be stretched by 300% of its original size. After 2,500 bending cycles at a 16-mm bending radius, the developed device remains its performance with only a slight decay (less than 10%) in inductance value and quality factor, indicating its superior stability.

The amorphous flexible mini-inductor's unique design allows it to adapt to various bending and folding application environments, making it ideal for use in thin and light electronic products that require high inductance density in a small volume. This study not only provides a new application scenario for amorphous soft magnetic alloys but also sheds light on the material selection and device design of flexible electronics technology.

In conclusion, the development of flexible mini-inductors made of amorphous alloys represents a promising step forward in the field of flexible electronics. With their high inductance density, mechanical flexibility, and stability, these devices have the potential to revolutionize the way we design and manufacture electronic products. So, if you're looking for a more efficient and compact solution for your next electronic project, consider using amorphous flexible mini-inductors.

Introduction

The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen an explosion of applications, particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs). These models, which underlie platforms like Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Bing AI, and ChatGPT, have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including cybersecurity. However, a clear understanding of their capabilities and risks is yet to emerge. A white paper by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and OpenAI emphasizes the need to evaluate LLMs using real-world, complex scenarios to ensure their safe and effective use in cybersecurity operations.

The Allure and Unknown Potential of LLMs in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a data-heavy, technical field that requires constant vigilance against ever-evolving threats. The potential of LLMs to act as force multipliers in this domain is undeniable. However, assessing the capabilities and risks associated with their use is challenging. While LLMs may excel in factual recall, it is unclear whether they can correctly deploy this knowledge in complex, real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Evaluating LLMs for Cybersecurity Tasks

The SEI and OpenAI paper argue that LLMs should be evaluated based on three branches of knowledge:

1. Theoretical knowledge: Foundational, textbook information that forms the basis of cybersecurity operations.
2. Practical knowledge: The ability to solve self-contained cybersecurity problems.
3. Applied knowledge: The achievement of higher-level objectives in open-ended situations.

However, evaluating LLMs presents unique challenges. Defining tasks for evaluation is difficult in a field as diverse as cybersecurity, and generating an adequate volume of questions to test LLMs' practical and applied knowledge requires advanced tooling that does not currently exist.

Guidance for Realistic Cybersecurity Evaluations of LLMs

The white paper provides a framework for designing realistic cybersecurity evaluations of LLMs, built on four overarching recommendations:

1. Define the real-world task for the evaluation to capture.
2. Represent tasks appropriately.
3. Make the evaluation robust.
4. Frame results appropriately.

Introduction

Imagine a wind turbine, and you're likely picturing the familiar windmill design, known as a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). However, the earliest wind turbines, invented in the Middle East during the 8th century for grinding grain, were vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT). These turbines, which spin perpendicular to the wind, boast several advantages over their HAWT counterparts, such as reduced noise, greater wind energy density, and less impact on wildlife. Despite these benefits, VAWTs have been largely absent from today's wind energy market. This is due to an engineering challenge: air flow control. Researchers Sébastien Le Fouest and Karen Mulleners from the School of Engineering Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Lab (UNFOLD) at EPFL believe they have found a solution to this problem through sensor technology and machine learning.

The Challenge: Air Flow Control

Europe's installed wind energy capacity is growing by 19 gigawatts per year. However, to meet the UN's 2050 objectives for carbon emissions, this figure needs to reach 30 GW. VAWTs have the potential to contribute significantly to this target, as they are quieter, less intrusive, and more wildlife-friendly than HAWTs. However, they face a critical challenge: their efficiency significantly drops in gusty wind conditions.

The vertical axis of rotation causes the blades to constantly change orientation with respect to the wind, leading to the formation of vortices in a phenomenon called dynamic stall. These vortices create transient structural loads that the blades cannot withstand. To tackle this issue, Le Fouest and Mulleners developed a novel approach using sensors, actuating blade shafts, and genetic algorithms to identify optimal pitch profiles for VAWT blades.

The Solution: Optimal Pitch Profiles and Dynamic Stall

Le Fouest and Mulleners conducted an experiment involving a VAWT blade mounted with sensors to measure the air forces acting on it. By pitching the blade back and forth at different angles, speeds, and amplitudes, they generated series of ""pitch profiles."" A computer then ran a genetic algorithm, which performed over 3,500",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/machine-learning-enabl-1.jpg,2024-04-03 10:09:10,"simulations to find the optimal pitch profile for mitigating dynamic stall. The results showed a 20% increase in aerodynamic performance during turbulent wind conditions.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-magnetic-fields-boosts-electrocatalysis-sustainable.html,Study shows magnetic fields boosts electrocatalysis for sustainable fuel production,"""Magnetic fields boost electrocatalysis for sustainable fuel production""","

Are you looking for a way to enhance the efficiency of fuel production processes and contribute to the quest for sustainable energy sources? If so, you're in luck! Researchers at EPFL have recently unveiled a novel approach that leverages the intersection of magnetic fields and electrocatalysis to boost clean energy technologies.

Electrocatalysis is a key tool in converting chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa, and is already used in various green-energy technologies such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. However, traditional electrocatalysis methods often fall short of optimizing the transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface, which can limit the reaction's efficiency and slow down our progress towards clean energy solutions.

In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Magalí Lingenfelder and her team at EPFL have developed a novel method that uses magnetic fields to enhance the movement of reactants and products at the catalyst surface. Their approach creates Lorentz forces, which induce whirling motions that facilitate more consistent and rapid reactions, even in the presence of reactant scarcity.

To achieve this, the researchers built a sophisticated magneto-electrochemical setup that allowed them to observe the movement of ions in real time under a magnetic field. They used a creative trick developed by Priscila and Yunchang to track the movement of ions in the electrolyte under a magnetic field and observe how magnetic forces can stir and enhance the movement of reactants around the catalyst.

The study showed that applying magnetic fields to non-magnetic electrodes significantly improved the efficiency of key electrocatalytic reactions for green energy, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) critical for fuel cells. The researchers observed more than a 50% boost in activity for the ORR induced by magnetic fields on non-magnetic interfaces, which allowed them to resolve many fundamental controversies in the field and demonstrate the mechanisms and conditions needed for magnetic fields to enhance different electrocatalytic reactions involving gas products or reactants like hydrogen and oxygen.

The study charts the way towards using magnetic fields to improve the efficiency of electrocatalysis and propel us towards more effective sustainable fuel production. It can revolutionize energy conversion technologies, make fuel cells more widely adopted in hydrogen vehicles, and increase the production of hydrogen as a clean energy source, while also mitigating environmental concerns.

In conclusion, the intersection of magnetic fields and electrocatalysis holds great promise for advancing sustainable energy technologies and paving the way for a cleaner and more sustainable future. The study by Lingenfelder and her team at EPFL represents a significant step forward in this field, and highlights the importance of continued research and innovation in the quest for sustainable energy solutions.

Introduction

Energy harvesting has emerged as a promising eco-friendly technology, with the potential to generate electricity from unused or discarded energy in everyday life. This includes harnessing vibrations generated by passing cars or trains. A fascinating development in this field involves the use of a new type of metasurface, which can be reconfigured similar to LEGO bricks, to significantly enhance the efficiency of energy harvesting.

A research team, comprising experts from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), has developed a multifunctional elastic metasurface that can be freely configured by attaching and detaching components. This breakthrough, published in Advanced Science, has successfully addressed limitations in the theoretical analysis of metamaterials, enabling their operation across a wide frequency range and expanding their utility in various applications.

The Power of Metamaterials

Metamaterials are artificially designed structures that manipulate wave energy, such as light, vibration, and sound, by exploiting the relationships among wavelengths. In energy harvesting, metamaterials can gather elastic waves in piezoelectric components, thereby increasing the efficiency of electricity production. However, the operation of these metamaterials has been limited to a single frequency, restricting their practical application in real structures.

To overcome this challenge, the research team employed the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory instead of the conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory takes into account the fundamental characteristics of elasticity, including shear deformation and rotational inertia effects of the beam, which significantly distinguishes it from the conventional counterpart. This study marks the first application of this theory to elastic metamaterial research.

Introducing the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest Beam-Based Reconfigurable Elastic Metasurface (TREM)

Introduction

Apple's slogan, ""Privacy. That's iPhone,"" suggests a strong commitment to user privacy. However, a recent study by Aalto University reveals that the default apps on Apple devices, which are nearly impossible to avoid, may not be as private as users think. This article examines the privacy settings of eight default Apple apps and sheds light on the discrepancies between user experiences and data handling processes.

The Research and Findings

Aalto University researchers focused on eight default apps – Safari, Siri, Family Sharing, iMessage, FaceTime, Location Services, Find My, and Touch ID – and gathered all publicly available privacy-related information. They found that users are not fully aware of the data collection taking place in the background, even when they choose not to enable certain features.

A prime example is Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. Users are given the option to enable or disable voice control, but Siri collects data from other apps regardless of this choice. This data collection is not explicitly stated during the setup process, leaving users uninformed about the extent of their data sharing.

In practice, protecting privacy on an Apple device requires expert navigation through individual app settings, a task made difficult by complex and confusing instructions. Aalto University researchers found that none of the apps' participants were able to prevent data sharing with other applications or the service provider.

Moreover, locating and adjusting privacy settings is time-consuming and lacks user feedback, making it difficult for users to determine if they've successfully protected their privacy.

The Data Apple Collects

While it's unclear how Apple uses the data collected from default apps based on public documents, researchers suggest that the information is likely used to train artificial intelligence systems and provide personalized user experiences.

Though many users appreciate seamless multi-device interaction, Apple could do more to clarify privacy settings and inform users about data handling practices.

Improving Privacy Settings and Guidelines

To enhance transparency and user control, Aalto University researchers offer detailed suggestions for improving privacy settings and guidelines. These recommendations include:

1. Simplifying the language used in privacy policies and settings.
2. Providing clear, step-by-step instructions for",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/keeping-your-data-from.jpg,2024-04-03 13:44:03,"Modifying privacy settings and offering feedback mechanisms to inform users of the success or failure of their privacy settings adjustments.
3. Allowing users to disable data sharing with third-party applications and service providers.
4. Implementing feedback mechanisms to inform users of the success or failure of their privacy settings adjustments.
5. Offering default app alternatives that prioritize user privacy.

Conclusion

While Apple's commitment to privacy is admirable, the company needs to address the discrepancies between user experiences and data handling practices in default apps. By implementing the recommendations offered in this article, Apple can enhance transparency, user control, and trust, ultimately leading to a more secure and private user experience.

","DCVC's Climate Select Fund: A Journey of Adjusted Expectations

The venture fundraising landscape has been tumultuous in recent years, and the Silicon Valley VC firm DCVC is no stranger to the challenges. Launched in December 2022 with a $500 million target, the firm's first climate-focused fund, DCVC Climate Select, has seen a significant downward revision in its target after a year of fundraising that brought in only $157 million in commitments by the end of 2023. Now, it seems that things might be falling into place, with $400 million being a more accurate reflection of the fund's trajectory.

DCVC, co-founded by Matt Ocko and Zachary Bogue, is a deep tech firm with a history of investments in companies like MosaicML, Square, AngelList, Uber, and more. The firm is known for its annual ""Deep Tech in Davos"" event, which brings together investors, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders to discuss the future of technology. During the 2023 event held in February, Bogue highlighted AI applications for climate technologies as one of the ""major opportunities"" for DCVC, alongside tech bio and robotics.

DCVC's Climate Select Fund is targeting climate startups at the mid-stages of their development, where the firm believes there is a current underfunding in the climate startup ecosystem. Although this is the firm's first dedicated climate tech fund, it has invested $360 million from other funds into such startups over the past decade, according to New Mexico SIC's March 26 meeting.

The industry standard is that a fund's target amount represents a pro forma amount before the fund can take on money from LPs. However, initially, the $500 million figure was just a placeholder, with the firm adjusting its expectations to more ""sober"" market conditions, according to a source familiar with the matter. This source added that DCVC's existing portfolio companies started seeing some wins in 2024, which could be helping the fundraising journey. One example is Twelve, a company that creates products traditionally made using fossil fuels from carbon. It recently signed a 14-year purchase agreement with the International Airlines Group, which includes airlines like Aer Lingus and British Airways, for 260 million gallons of Twelve's more sustainable aviation fuel.

DCVC is not the only fund to lower a target or hold a final close on less capital than expected after a challenging 2022 and 2023 fundraising cycle. Tiger Global's latest fund raised $2.2 billion of its $6 billion target, while Founders Fund, Insight Partners, and TCV all slashed their fund targets in the first half of 2023.

Despite these challenges, the venture capital industry has seen an increasing focus on climate investing, attracting significant attention and fundraising success. Climate-focused VC funds have raised more than $710 million so far in 2024, according to data from Preqin, on track to match or surpass last year's $2.17 billion raised and not far off 2022's record of $2.9 billion. While both LPs and analysts have told TechCrunch that they do not expect 2024 to be a significantly better year for VC fundraising, for DCVC's new climate fund, things may be headed in a better direction than its recent SEC disclosures have indicated.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1186549350.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-03 21:45:12,"Invest in DCVC's Climate Select Fund: A Journey of Adjusted Expectations

A recent study from ESMT Berlin sheds light on this topic, exploring the role of AI as a ""manager"" of human workers performing research tasks.

Researchers Maximilian Koehler, Ph.D. candidate at ESMT, and Henry Sauermann, professor of strategy at ESMT, examined the capabilities of AI in performing important managerial functions such as task division and allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning. They found that AI can not only replicate but also potentially surpass human managers by leveraging its instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities.

The study investigated algorithmic management (AM) in crowd and citizen science and examined five important managerial functions. The researchers identified projects that use AM, understood how AI performs management functions, and explored when AM might be more effective.

The results of the study suggest that the adoption of AM could be a critical factor in improving research productivity. AI-enabled projects are often larger than projects that do not use AM and are associated with platforms that provide access to shared AI tools. This indicates that AM may enable projects to scale but also requires technical infrastructures that stand-alone projects may find difficult to develop.

While AI can take over important management functions, this does not mean that principal investigators or human managers will become obsolete. As Sauermann notes, ""If AI can take over some of the more algorithmic and mundane functions of management, human leaders could shift their attention to more strategic and social tasks such as identifying high-value research targets, raising funding, or building an effective organizational culture.""

Overall, the study highlights the potential of AI to enhance the scope and efficiency of scientific research by managing complex, large-scale projects.

Introduction

The world of artificial intelligence (AI) has long been dominated by men, but there are remarkable women who have contributed significantly to this revolutionary field. TechCrunch is highlighting these women through a series of interviews, and one such trailblazer is Kathi Vidal, the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). With a background in engineering and law, Vidal has made her mark in AI, intellectual property, and innovation policy. In this profile, we delve into her journey, accomplishments, and insights on navigating the male-dominated tech and AI industries.

From Engineer to Intellectual Property Lawyer

Kathi Vidal's fascination with scientific problem-solving began at a young age, which led her to pursue a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Binghamton University and a Master's degree in electrical engineering from Syracuse University. She then worked as an engineer for General Electric and Lockheed Martin, focusing on AI, software engineering, and circuitry. Recognizing the potential of AI to transform various industries, Vidal decided to further her education and obtained a JD from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Navigating the Male-Dominated Tech Industry

Vidal's career in engineering was marked by her early experiences in a male-dominated field. She recalls being advised by some of her male colleagues to ""laugh less"" and conform to the prevailing norms. However, Vidal found joy in her work and embraced her authentic self in the mid-2000s, which she believes contributed to her success. As a result, she has been deliberate about fostering inclusive environments and championing policies that encourage women's participation in innovation.

Pioneering AI Fault Diagnostic System

Vidal is particularly proud of her work in developing the first AI fault diagnostic system for aircraft. Collaborating with a team of PhDs at GE Research, she built a resilient, self-learning system that combined neural networks, fuzzy logic, and expert systems.

Faraday Future, a troubled electric vehicle (EV) startup, has managed to dodge eviction from its Los Angeles headquarters, but only momentarily. The company, known for its financial woes, recently struck a deal with its landlord, Rexford Industrial, to remain in the building under certain conditions. However, this reprieve might be short-lived, as Faraday Future continues to grapple with cash flow issues.

In April 2024, Faraday Future reached an agreement with Rexford Industrial, stipulating that the EV startup could stay in the building provided it met specific terms. If the company fails to comply with any of these conditions, Rexford reserves the right to demand immediate payment and could potentially evict Faraday Future. Assuming the company adheres to the agreement, it can occupy the building until the lease expires in September 2025.

This recent development comes as Faraday Future faces yet another financial crisis. As of September 2023, the company reported having only $8.5 million in cash reserves, according to a regulatory filing in April 2024. This figure is the most recent available, as Faraday Future has delayed submitting its annual financial report for 2023, partly due to outstanding payments to third-party audit consultants.

Rexford's legal action against Faraday Future began in February 2024 when the landlord claimed the startup had missed multiple lease payments, totaling close to $1 million. As part of the April 2024 agreement, Faraday Future must pay $312,524.46 toward its outstanding debt by April 30, cover this month's rent of $305,617.08 by April 15, and pay next month's rent of $312,419.63 by May 6.

One of the most exciting features of Stable Audio 2.0 is its audio-to-audio capabilities. This enables users to upload audio samples and create a wide array of sounds using natural language prompts. Imagine being able to transform a simple voice memo into a professional-sounding podcast episode or a basic melody into a fully-produced song – all with just a few words.

Another intriguing aspect of Stable Audio 2.0 is its style transfer feature. With this tool, users can modify generated or uploaded audio to align with a specific style and tone. This opens up a world of possibilities for content creators looking to maintain a consistent audio brand or experiment with different genres.

To ensure the protection of creative integrity and artists' rights, Stability AI has implemented strict measures. Users must upload audio samples free of copyrighted material, and the company uses content recognition technology from Audible Magic to prevent infringement. Artists' rights are further safeguarded as both Stable Audio 1.0 and 2.0 were trained on data from AudioSparx, which includes more than 800,000 audio files, and whose artists were given the option to opt out of the Stable Audio model training.

Stable Audio 2.0 also boasts impressive technical specifications. The model can produce tracks up to three minutes long at 44.1 kHz stereo, a significant upgrade from Stable Audio's 45-second limit. This three-minute generation includes all the elements needed for a complete track, such as melodies, backing tracks, sound effects, and more.

The model is now publicly available for free use on the Stable",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a09a608c2248eed47e838de9ec8fb761ef6cad2c/2024/04/03/96e7d214-0dc7-4f3c-93b6-8585049a569e/img-1697.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-03 00:00:00,"Try Stability AI's Stable Audio 2.0 for free!

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/openai-backed-ghost-autonomy-shuts-down/,OpenAI-backed Ghost Autonomy shuts down, Autonomous driving startup Ghost Autonomy shuts down after raising $219 million in funding but unable to bring product to market. ,"Ghost Autonomy, a startup that aimed to deliver autonomous driving software to automakers, has shut down. The company had raised $219 million in funding and employed about 100 people across Mountain View, Dallas, and Sydney. The startup had posted a note on its website stating that it had ended worldwide operations as of Wednesday.

The company's co-founder and CEO, John Hayes, mentioned that the path to long-term profitability was uncertain due to the current funding climate and long-term investment required for autonomy development and commercialization. The company is exploring potential long-term destinations for its team's innovations.

Ghost Autonomy was founded in 2017 and had made its public debut two years later with $63.7 million in investment. The company originally aimed to develop a kit that would allow privately owned passenger vehicles to drive autonomously on highways, but after the deadline came and went, the company shifted its focus to crash prevention tech. The startup raised another $100 million in 2021 with an altered plan to develop universal collision avoidance technology.

Hayes argued that an autonomous driving system didn't need to recognize and categorize objects prior to avoiding them. The company was instead tracking the movement of clusters of pixels in a scene. However, the startup's approach was met with skepticism from experts. Despite making a highway driving product and moving in urban environments through last-mile delivery, the company couldn't finance the years required to bring the product to market.

In conclusion, Ghost Autonomy's shutdown shows how difficult it is to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. The startup had pivoted its approach over the years but still couldn't secure the necessary funding to bring its product to market. It's a lesson for startups working on complex and innovative technologies that require significant investment and time to develop.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/63601ea88ad98c2b9489d284_Ghost-autonomy-01-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-03 21:17:52,"Invest in Autonomy: A Lesson Learned from Ghost Autonomy's Shutdown

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-simple-harvest-blue-energy.html,Researchers find a simple way to harvest more 'blue energy' from waves, Blue Energy Harvesting Breakthrough: TENG Device Increases Conversion 2.4x ,"The power of waves is undeniable, and now we have a better way to harness that energy with a new blue energy harvesting device. Researchers have optimized the liquid–solid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which converts mechanical energy into electricity as water sloshes back and forth against the inside of a tube. The new design increased the device's conversion of mechanical energy to electrical current by 2.4 times.

The TENG device, created by Guozhang Dai, Kai Yin, Junliang Yan and their team, was made with 16-inch clear plastic tubes filled with water. The conventional design had a copper foil electrode at the center of the tube, while the new design had a copper foil electrode at one end of the tube. The researchers found that placing the electrode at the end where the water crashes with the most force increased the device's energy harvesting ability.

In another experiment, the optimized TENG blinked an array of 35 LEDs on and off as water entered the section of the tube covered by the electrode and then flowed away, respectively. This demonstration shows the potential of the device for other applications like wireless underwater signaling communications.

The researchers say their findings lay the foundation for larger-scale blue energy harvesting from ocean waves and show the device's potential for other applications. The optimized TENG could revolutionize the way we harness the power of waves, making it possible to generate clean and sustainable energy from the ocean's constant ebb and flow.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-simple-way-to-harves.jpg,2024-04-03 08:00:02,"Generate Meta Description: Discover the power of waves with a new blue energy harvesting device.

Meta’s Apps Hit With Outages and Issues

In the past month, Meta has faced a series of disruptions to some of its most popular apps. This includes WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. While rare for such large-scale services, Meta’s status page confirmed that key business services such as the Ads Manager, Messenger Platform, WhatsApp Business API, and others were facing issues.

In an update to their X account, WhatsApp confirmed the outage, stating that they were working on getting things back to 100% as quickly as possible. Users reported issues accessing Instagram and Messenger as well, with crowdsourced reporting sites like Downdector signaling potential outages. However, it’s important to note that Downdector is not an official confirmation of an outage.

While the outage seems to be centered around WhatsApp, some users reported that it had already been resolved by the time of writing. In our own tests, Meta’s apps were loading, and we could send messages via WhatsApp.

This is not the first time that Meta’s apps have experienced a significant outage this year. On Super Tuesday in the U.S. (March 5, 2024), Facebook, Instagram, and Threads were all down, leading users to experience error messages such as “something went wrong” or being taken to a landing page where they were logged out and unable to get back in. The outage lasted for several hours before the apps came back online. At the time, Meta’s status page reported issues with products such as Ads Manager as well.
