https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/,Apple cancels its autonomous electric car project and is laying off some workers,"

In a surprising turn of events, Apple has pulled the plug on its long-standing, clandestine project to develop an autonomous electric car, as reported by Bloomberg. The decision has already set in motion layoffs among the project's dedicated team, as confirmed by TechCrunch.

The extent of the layoffs remains unclear, but a significant portion of the nearly 2,000 employees involved in the project will be reassigned to Apple's generative AI initiatives, according to Bloomberg. This strategic shift reflects the company's evolving priorities and focus on emerging technologies.

The decision to terminate the car project coincides with a period of reassessment within the automotive industry, as major automakers reevaluate their investments in electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. The heightened scrutiny surrounding autonomous vehicle projects has also contributed to Apple's decision.

Initially, Apple's entry into the automotive sector was seen as a potential game-changer, promising a new revenue stream to offset declining hardware sales and regulatory challenges in its services business. However, the company's efforts to bring its car project to fruition faced numerous challenges and setbacks.

Apple's car project, codenamed ""Project Titan,"" was first initiated in 2014. Over the past decade, the project's direction fluctuated between developing an all-electric Tesla competitor and a fully autonomous vehicle similar to Waymo's offerings. In January, Bloomberg reported that the project's leadership faced mounting pressure from Apple's top executives and board to expedite the project's progress and deliver a tangible product.

As this story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Apple's decision will impact the automotive industry and the broader technology landscape.

In a surprising turn of events, Apple has pulled the plug on its long-standing, secretive endeavor to create an autonomous electric car, codenamed ""Project Titan."" Bloomberg broke the news, reporting that the tech giant has already begun dismissing some members of the project team.

The extent of the layoffs remains uncertain, but a significant portion of the nearly 2,000 employees dedicated to the project will be reassigned to Apple's generative AI initiatives. This decision reflects a broader trend among major automakers, who are reassessing their investments in electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Apple's foray into the automotive industry was seen as a potential game-changer, promising a new revenue stream to offset declining hardware sales and regulatory challenges in its services business. However, the project faced numerous challenges, including leadership changes, shifting priorities, and technical hurdles.

Initially conceived in 2014, Project Titan underwent several iterations, vacillating between developing an all-electric Tesla rival and a fully autonomous vehicle similar to Waymo's offerings. In January, Bloomberg reported that Apple's top executives and board were pressuring the project's leadership to expedite the release of a marketable product.

As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Apple's decision will impact the broader autonomous vehicle landscape. Will other tech companies follow suit, or will they double down on their investments in this transformative technology? Only time will tell.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/tiktok-loses-even-more-songs-over-its-dispute-with-universal-music-group/,TikTok loses even more songs over its dispute with Universal Music Group,"

In a recent turn of events, TikTok and Universal Music Group (UMG) have locked horns over royalties, leading to the removal of songs published by UMG from the platform. This dispute has escalated, with TikTok now facing the removal of songs containing compositions controlled by Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG).

The impact is significant, as UMPG's catalog represents a substantial portion of popular songs on TikTok, ranging from 20% to 30%. This means that even if a song is owned by another label, if a songwriter signed to UMPG contributed to any part of it, TikTok must remove it.

This development extends the impact beyond UMG's own artists and songwriters, affecting artists signed to other labels as well. TikTok is taking proactive steps to remove all content licensed by UMPG before the end of February to ensure legal compliance.

UMG's decision has drawn criticism from TikTok, which accused the music giant of prioritizing greed over the interests of artists and songwriters. TikTok emphasized that UMG's actions are self-serving and detrimental to the music industry.

While UMG maintains that these changes won't affect its revenue, the consequences for artists and songwriters are undeniable. They lose the opportunity to promote their music on one of the most influential social platforms, known for its role in music discovery. Additionally, they forfeit royalties earned from their music on TikTok.

UMG acknowledges the downsides but asserts its responsibility to fight for a new agreement that ensures fair compensation for artists' work.

This ongoing dispute highlights the complex dynamics between music streaming platforms and record labels, with artists and songwriters caught in the crossfire. The outcome of this clash will shape the future of music distribution and consumption in the digital age.

In the bustling city of Barcelona, amidst the grandeur of Mobile World Congress, a beacon of innovation emerged from the heart of Ethiopia: eQub, the fintech startup that triumphed at 4YFN 2024's pitch-off event. This remarkable venture is poised to revolutionize the traditional Equb, a time-honored Ethiopian peer-to-peer credit system, by propelling it into the digital age.

eQub's mission is to empower the growing population of Ethiopians with bank accounts and mobile phones, yet lack access to formal credit. This digital transformation of the Equb system not only enhances convenience but also introduces a novel points system that enables users to establish a credible credit history. This opens up exciting possibilities for future expansion into BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) services and regular loans.

With an impressive 25,000 users and 200 saving groups since its launch, eQub is gaining rapid traction. Its user-friendly app offers two options: joining an existing group or creating a curated one. To ensure the security of savings, eQub employs rigorous KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, particularly for curated groups. Additionally, the startup has partnered with over 10 banks and 20 corporate entities, leveraging data sharing to mitigate risks.

eQub's sights are set on expanding its reach to gig workers, a significant segment of the workforce in sub-Saharan cities. The company aims to reach 1 million gig workers by 2025, fueled by the app's inherent virality and strategic marketing efforts. To accelerate its growth trajectory, eQub is seeking a $500,000 pre-seed funding round.

The recognition at MWC has not only boosted eQub's visibility but also fueled its ambition to expand into other countries in the near future. With its innovative approach to digitizing traditional financial systems, eQub is poised to transform the financial landscape of Ethiopia and beyond, empowering individuals and communities with greater access to credit and financial services.

It offers a captivating experience by transforming your Mac desktop into a spatial computing environment. However, users who desire an even more immersive and versatile setup can now rejoice with the arrival of Splitscreen, an innovative app that unlocks the potential for a second macOS display on the Vision Pro.

Imagine the convenience of having two Mac displays within your Vision Pro, each serving a distinct purpose. Whether you're a creative professional juggling multiple projects or a multitasker seeking a more organized workspace, Splitscreen has you covered. It effectively recreates the feeling of a multi-monitor setup, but within the captivating VR/AR environment of the Vision Pro.

The journey to bring Splitscreen to life wasn't without its challenges. Developer Jordi Bruin acknowledges the complexities involved in achieving this feat. However, the team's dedication and innovative approach have paved the way for future enhancements, including more displays, customizable settings, and improved stability.

Behind the scenes, a talented trio of developers, Mathijs Kadjik, Tom Lokhorst, and Jordi Bruin, joined forces to make Splitscreen a reality. Their expertise in developing apps that bridge the gap between iOS and Mac devices proved invaluable in creating this groundbreaking solution.

The inspiration for Splitscreen arose from the developers' personal experiences with dual-display setups on their MacBook Pros. They recognized the need for a similar solution within the Vision Pro's virtual environment. The desire to scratch their own itch and contribute to the niche of VR/AR app development fueled their passion for this project.

Upon launch, Splitscreen automatically seeks the best network connection between your Vision Pro and Mac. Recognizing that performance can be influenced by various factors, the developers offer a generous 15-minute free session to allow users to thoroughly test the app on their own network. This session can be reset after each use, or users can opt for a one-time in-app purchase of $20 to remove the time limit, at least until the end of March.

Currently, Splitscreen supports a single resolution of 1920×1080, but the developers are actively working on expanding resolution options and enabling support for more than two displays. They envision Splitscreen becoming an indispensable tool for multitasking across different apps in professional workflows.

The initial release of Splitscreen through TestFlight garnered an impressive 1,500 testers, a testament to the growing interest in this innovative app. The feedback from these testers has been instrumental in refining the app's performance, understanding user needs, and determining the optimal pricing strategy.

Now available as a free download on the App Store, Splitscreen offers a one-time in-app purchase of $20 for users seeking an unlimited experience. With its intuitive interface and seamless integration with the Vision Pro, Splitscreen is poised to revolutionize the way we interact with our digital workspaces in the realm of virtual reality.

In the realm of social media, a fierce battle is unfolding between Instagram's Threads and X, formerly known as Twitter. The contest for dominance in the microblogging arena has taken an intriguing turn, with Threads emerging as the current frontrunner.

Initially, Threads enjoyed a surge in popularity upon its launch, but its downloads fluctuated as Meta experimented with various strategies to attract users. However, a remarkable shift occurred towards the end of last year. Threads' daily installs skyrocketed, consistently surpassing those of X across both iOS and Google Play.

This surge in Threads' popularity has raised eyebrows, particularly given Twitter's long-standing reign in the microblogging space. If Threads maintains its momentum, it could potentially dethrone Twitter as the preferred platform for journalists, researchers, academics, and news enthusiasts.

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recently announced that Threads had amassed 130 million monthly active users, a testament to its growing appeal. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, highlighted Threads' exceptional performance in Japan, a market where Twitter once held a strong presence.

In contrast, X has faced challenges in attracting new users, with its rebranding from Twitter potentially contributing to the decline in downloads. Additionally, concerns about automated accounts and spam on X have further tarnished its reputation.

While decentralized X alternatives like Mastodon and Bluesky have emerged, they have yet to make a significant impact, with their user bases remaining relatively small. However, Bluesky's recent launch and the introduction of federation, allowing anyone to run their own server, offer a glimmer of hope for a decentralized Twitter alternative.

As the battle for microblogging supremacy continues, Threads' consistent growth and X's ongoing struggles paint an intriguing picture. Whether Threads can maintain its lead and reshape the information-sharing landscape remains to be seen. The coming months will undoubtedly bring further twists and turns in this captivating social media saga.

In a world where digital photography has become the norm, a startup called Lapse is offering a nostalgic twist to the experience. Inspired by the charm and simplicity of analog cameras, Lapse allows smartphone users to capture and share photos with a unique twist – you have to wait to see them ""developed,"" just like in the old days.

Lapse has gained significant traction, boasting millions of users, 100 million photos captured monthly, and a consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photography apps. Recently, the company secured a $30 million funding round led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, bringing its total funding to over $42 million and valuing it at around $150 million.

Lapse's plans include enhancing the behind-the-scenes processing of ""unedited"" photos, introducing new features to improve the photo experience, and eventually expanding into video. While monetization is a potential consideration, the company aims to avoid the traditional advertising route that many social apps rely on.

The app's mechanics are a blend of old-school ethos and modern technology. CEO Dan Silvertown, inspired by his brother's longing for a simpler photography experience while traveling, co-founded Lapse to recreate the analog experience through a smartphone.

Behind the scenes, Lapse employs a series of processing steps, including elements of computer vision, to optimize the composition and appearance of photos. However, the app has faced criticism for its initial growth-hacking tactics, which involved forced invites to expand its user base.

Despite these concerns, Lapse claims to have moved away from forced invites and is now finding its own virality through a critical mass of users. However, the app's dark patterns can still be tricky to navigate for new users, especially those sensitive about sharing data on social apps.

Lapse's emergence coincides with a growing consumer awareness of the trade-offs involved in using popular social apps. With many users seeking simpler alternatives, Lapse believes there's room for players who offer a more authentic and intimate experience.

As Jacob Andreou, a general partner at Greylock, points out, many social media platforms started as places to connect with friends but have since evolved into something else. Lapse aims to fill this gap by providing a space where users can easily stay updated with their friends' lives, harkening back to the original purpose of social media.

Lapse's journey is a testament to the enduring appeal of simplicity and authenticity in a world saturated with digital distractions. As the company continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how it navigates the challenges of growth and monetization while staying true to its core values.

Debunking the Myth: Blood Donation After Covid-19 Vaccination

In the midst of ongoing concerns about blood shortages, a rumor has surfaced, claiming that the American Red Cross prohibits blood donation after receiving Covid-19 vaccines. This misinformation could potentially jeopardize the nation's blood supply, especially considering the high vaccination rates among Americans.

However, let's set the record straight – the rumor is unfounded. The American Red Cross has explicitly stated that individuals who have received Covid-19 vaccines, except for specific cases, can donate blood without any restrictions.

The confusion seems to arise from the eligibility criteria mentioned on the Red Cross website regarding immunization and vaccination. The guidelines specify that those vaccinated with non-replicating, inactivated, or RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and AstraZeneca, can donate blood immediately, provided they are symptom-free and fever-free.

However, a two-week waiting period is recommended for individuals vaccinated with live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines. These vaccines use a weakened form of the virus to stimulate the immune response. While safe for individuals with healthy immune systems, they may pose a potential risk to immunocompromised individuals.

It's crucial to note that the vast majority of Covid-19 vaccines administered in the United States are non-replicating or RNA-based, which do not require a waiting period before blood donation. Live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines are still in the trial phase and have not been widely distributed.

The American Red Cross's cautious approach is aimed at ensuring the safety of both donors and recipients. By asking about live attenuated vaccines, they minimize the risk of transmitting any potential viruses through blood transfusions.

Rest assured, blood donation after Covid-19 vaccination is safe and encouraged. The Red Cross has implemented stringent protocols to safeguard the blood supply and protect the health of donors and patients alike.

If you're eligible to donate blood, please consider making a life-saving contribution. Your selfless act can make a profound difference in someone's life.

In the realm of entrepreneurship, small enterprises serve as catalysts for innovation and economic growth. Yet, the path to success for these ventures is often fraught with challenges. To help aspiring and current business owners navigate this landscape, let's delve into the top four reasons why small businesses falter.

1. Underestimating Sales and Marketing:

Sales and marketing form the lifeblood of any business, regardless of its size. A common pitfall for small enterprises is underestimating the significance of a solid sales and marketing strategy. Entrepreneurs must recognize the importance of understanding customer needs, communicating effectively, and building lasting relationships. Implementing effective sales and marketing strategies involves utilizing tools like CRM software, continuously engaging with the market, and adapting to evolving demands.

3. Insufficient Effort:

The journey of a small business demands unwavering effort and dedication. Insufficient effort, not just in terms of physical labor but also mental and emotional investment, can lead to failure. Entrepreneurs must be willing to work harder and learn more than others, setting clear goals, maintaining a strong work ethic, and embracing continuous learning. Successful entrepreneurs often share stories of long hours, relentless persistence, and unwavering effort in facing challenges.

4. Lack of Knowledge:

A lack of knowledge can be a significant obstacle for small businesses. Entrepreneurs should possess intelligence and eagerness to learn, staying updated with digital marketing trends, online sales channels, and industry regulations. Continuous learning through courses, workshops, business publications, and webinars is essential. Networking with professionals, embracing technology, and staying informed about industry developments can provide a competitive edge.

Conclusion:

The path to entrepreneurial success is undoubtedly challenging, but it's a journey worth embarking on. By understanding and overcoming the common reasons for failure, entrepreneurs can position themselves for success. With tenacity, the right mindset, and unwavering effort, the world of financial freedom is within reach. Are you ready to rise to the challenge and navigate your way to business triumph?

Elon Musk's Windows 11 Woes: A Tale of Frustration and Tech Support Misadventures

In the realm of technology, even the most affluent and influential individuals can encounter unexpected challenges. Such was the case for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who recently found himself entangled in a battle with Microsoft over the installation of Windows 11 on his new PC laptop.

Musk's primary concern stemmed from the mandatory requirement to create a Microsoft account during the installation process. This stipulation raised red flags for the tech mogul, who expressed his apprehension about granting Microsoft's AI program, Copilot, access to his personal computer.

Musk's predicament resonated with many Windows users who shared similar sentiments regarding Copilot's integration into Windows 11. The outcry against this mandatory feature prompted Musk to seek assistance from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, leveraging his direct connection to the tech giant's top executive.

While Musk's approach may seem unconventional, it highlights the growing frustration among users who feel their privacy and autonomy are being compromised by intrusive software. The mandatory inclusion of Copilot has sparked a debate about the appropriate boundaries between user convenience and corporate data collection.

For those seeking an alternative solution, Windows expert Ed Bott suggests a workaround that involves entering a fictitious Microsoft account address and password. This method allows users to bypass the mandatory account creation and create a local account instead. However, this approach comes with a tradeoff: the system's drive will not be automatically encrypted, leaving data vulnerable to potential breaches.

For those already using Windows 11 with a Microsoft account and seeking to remove Copilot's presence, Bott provides a step-by-step guide to convert to a local account. This process involves navigating through the Settings menu and following the prompts to switch to a local account.

For individuals who harbor deep-rooted distrust towards Windows and Microsoft AI, a more drastic solution lies in embracing Desktop Linux. This open-source operating system is widely used by Musk's companies, including X, SpaceX, and Tesla. While Linux offers a robust and customizable platform, it may require a learning curve for those accustomed to Windows' user interface.

Elon Musk's experience serves as a reminder that even the most tech-savvy individuals can encounter challenges when navigating the complexities of modern technology. His quest for a Copilot-free Windows 11 installation highlights the ongoing tension between user privacy and corporate interests in the digital age.

In the realm of AI video generation, a new battleground has emerged as Pika, a prominent player in the industry, unveils its latest feature, Lip Sync, exclusively for its Pro subscribers. This groundbreaking innovation allows users to effortlessly add spoken dialogue to their AI-generated videos, breathing life into their creations with AI-powered voices from ElevenLabs, a renowned generative audio startup. The Lip Sync feature synchronizes the characters' mouth movements with the spoken dialogue, creating a seamless and engaging experience.

Pika's Lip Sync feature is a game-changer in the world of AI video generation. It removes one of the biggest barriers to creating compelling narrative films using AI, enabling users to produce videos with realistic dialogue and character interactions. This feature sets Pika apart from its competitors, as most other leading AI video generators lack this capability.

The addition of Lip Sync marks a significant step forward in the evolution of AI video generation technology. It brings us closer to the day when AI can be used to create full-length narrative films, opening up new possibilities for filmmakers and content creators.

However, the rapid advancement of AI video generation also raises concerns about the training data used to develop these models. Ed Newton-Rex, CEO of Fairly Trained, a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring AI models obtain consent from creators and data holders, has questioned the training data used by Pika's video model. This highlights the need for transparency and ethical considerations in the development of AI video generation technology.

Despite these concerns, the race among AI video generator companies continues to intensify, with each company striving to introduce new features and produce higher-quality videos. This competition benefits users, providing them with more options and better tools to create engaging and captivating content.

While the impact of AI video generation on the professional filmmaking community remains a topic of debate, with some expressing concerns about job displacement, the technology's potential to revolutionize storytelling and filmmaking is undeniable. As AI video generation technology continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to witness how it shapes the future of filmmaking and content creation.
