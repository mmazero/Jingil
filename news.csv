In the modern world, we spend an increasing amount of time indoors, depriving ourselves of the sun's natural benefits. This has led to a growing awareness of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and its link to serotonin production in the brain.

Light therapy lamps have become popular as a way to mimic the sun's effects, but they can be bulky and inconvenient. Recently, there has been growing interest in using near-infrared (NIR) light as an alternative to visible light therapy.

NIR light falls between infrared and visible light on the spectrum, and it has been shown to have potential therapeutic applications in a variety of medical conditions. At a recent tech event, a Dutch company showcased small NIR devices designed to replace traditional SAD lamps. These devices are still in the concept stage, but they offer a promising new approach to treating SAD.

As someone who has struggled with depression, I'm intrigued by the potential of NIR light therapy. While more research is needed, some studies have shown that NIR light can improve mood, reduce drowsiness, and lower resting heart rate.

It's important to note that NIR light therapy is not a cure-all for depression, and it may not be effective for everyone. However, it's a promising new treatment option that deserves further exploration.

If you're interested in trying NIR light therapy, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, it's important to choose a device that is safe and effective. Second, you should start with a low dose of light and gradually increase it over time. Finally, you should be patient and consistent with your treatment.

NIR light therapy is a promising new treatment option for SAD and other mood disorders. While more research is needed, it's a safe and effective way to improve your mood and overall well-being.

In the realm of smartphones, the rear side often remains an underutilized canvas. While cameras have found their place, the vast expanse of blank space begs for more functionality. A fully functional secondary screen, however, comes with drawbacks like increased battery consumption, bulkier design, and a higher price tag.

Enter the Infinix E-Color Shift, an innovative approach that breathes life into the otherwise dormant back panel. Unlike its predecessor, the Yota Phone, which employed a monochrome e-ink display, the E-Color Shift introduces vibrant colors to the mix. However, it falls short of being a fully functional secondary display. Instead, it serves as an aesthetic enhancement, a dynamic canvas that can showcase various designs and patterns.

The technology behind the E-Color Shift is intriguing. By applying different voltages, the electric field within the microstructure changes, causing corresponding color particles to move and display desired colors. This ingenious mechanism allows the phone's back panel to transform its appearance at will, all without consuming power.

While the E-Color Shift made its debut at CES last month, my experience with it at MWC in Barcelona revealed its prototype nature. The technology was showcased using a dummy unit connected to an external battery pack, highlighting its developmental stage.

Similar to e-ink displays, the E-Color Shift panel retains static images even when the battery is not actively powering it. However, the practicality of this feature remains questionable. It's unlikely to drive significant consumer demand, especially considering that the back panel is often covered by a case or simply faces down on a surface.

Whether the E-Color Shift technology will be licensed by third parties or find its way onto an Infinix device remains uncertain. The company likely hopes for the latter, but the appeal of this technology as a sole selling point seems limited. Its functionality is niche, and its visibility is often obstructed.

The Infinix E-Color Shift represents an intriguing concept, but its practical application and market viability remain to be seen. It's a creative exploration of the possibilities of smartphone design, but whether it will revolutionize the industry or fade into obscurity remains a question mark.

Navigating the Nuances: North American VCs in Europe's Startup Ecosystem

In recent years, Europe has emerged as a vibrant hub for startups, attracting the attention of venture capitalists from across the globe. North American VCs, in particular, have flocked to the region, eager to tap into its potential for outsized returns. However, establishing a successful long-term strategy in Europe has proven to be a challenging endeavor.

The European Ecosystem: A Unique Landscape

Europe's startup market presents a unique set of challenges for North American investors. The region's diverse languages, currencies, and regulatory frameworks make it a complex and fragmented landscape. Additionally, the networks that support startups and universities in Europe differ significantly from those in the United States.

Intensifying Competition and Shifting Dynamics

The European VC market has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. Local players have emerged as major players, capturing a significant share of early-stage funding. This has intensified competition for the best deals, making it harder for North American VCs to gain a foothold.

The London Conundrum: A Double-Edged Sword

Many North American VCs have set up shop in London, a global financial hub. While London offers easy access to capital and talent, it may not provide the best vantage point for understanding the broader European ecosystem. This focus on London has led to increased competition for deals and may have caused VCs to overlook opportunities in other promising European regions.

Regulatory Clarity: A Silver Lining

Despite the challenges, Europe offers a clear regulatory landscape for emerging sectors like AI and crypto. This clarity provides a level of certainty that is often lacking in the United States, where regulations are still evolving. This has attracted VCs who are looking to invest in these rapidly growing industries.

The Road Ahead: Adaptation and Perseverance

Despite the challenges, North American VCs continue to explore opportunities in Europe. Some firms are merging with local players to gain a better understanding of the market and access to promising deals. Others are focusing on specific sectors or regions where they believe they can add value.

Conclusion: A Promising Future for International Collaboration

While the European startup ecosystem presents unique challenges for North American VCs, it also offers immense potential for growth and innovation. By adapting their strategies, collaborating with local players, and focusing on sectors where they have expertise, North American VCs can position themselves for success in this dynamic and ever-evolving market.

While acknowledging the potential pitfalls of regulation, she emphasizes the need to expose the power dynamics and create counter-narratives that reorient attention to AI's societal impacts.

Notable Achievements: AI Landscape Report and FTC Contributions

Among her many accomplishments, Amba is particularly proud of the 2023 AI Landscape report released by the AI Now Institute. This report provided a timely diagnosis of AI's economic and societal implications, cutting through the hype and refocusing attention on the need for action.

Amba's tenure as Senior Advisor to the Federal Trade Commission on AI was also a highlight of her career. She played a crucial role in emerging technology issues and key enforcement actions, demonstrating the impact that individuals can have in shaping policymaking.

Navigating the Male-Dominated Tech Industry

The tech industry, including the AI sector, faces persistent challenges in terms of diversity and inclusion. Amba emphasizes the need to move beyond addressing the ""white dude problem"" and focus on the structural inequalities and power imbalances that perpetuate harmful or exploitative uses of technology.

She advocates for exposing the power dynamics concealed by the tech industry, examining the incentives, infrastructures, and labor markets that shape the direction of technology. This approach, she believes, can create counter-narratives and alternative imaginations for the appropriate role of technology in society.

Advice for Women Aspiring to Enter the AI Field

Amba's advice to women and other minoritized identities seeking to enter the AI field is to stand their ground. She encourages them to challenge the status quo, push back against attempts to discredit their critiques, and claim their rightful place in shaping the future of AI.

Amba emphasizes that everyone has a stake in the future of AI, and it's essential to assert expertise and authority on matters of technology that impact society. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable AI landscape that benefits all.
