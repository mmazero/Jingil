https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/21/adhd-medications-might-help-prevent-drug--alcohol-overdose/,ADHD Medications Might Help Prevent Drug & Alcohol Overdose, ADHD Medication Linked to Lower Risk of Drug & Alcohol Overdose ,"

ADHD Medication Linked to Reduced Risk of Premature Death

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. While there is no cure for ADHD, medication can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

A recent study involving over 148,000 people with ADHD found that taking prescribed ADHD medications was associated with lower rates of premature deaths from unnatural causes, such as accidental drug and alcohol overdoses and unintentional injuries.

Study Findings

Researchers followed nearly 150,000 Swedish individuals with ADHD for over a decade. They compared the risk of premature death among those who started taking prescribed ADHD medications within three months of diagnosis to those who remained unmedicated.

The results showed that around 57% of the participants were taking one of six medications approved for ADHD treatment in Sweden, including methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine. The remaining 43% did not receive ADHD medication.

The study found that medicated participants had a significantly lower risk of dying from drug and alcohol overdoses. Interestingly, among female participants, ADHD medication initiation was also associated with a lower rate of natural-cause mortality, such as death from a physical health condition.

How ADHD Medication Helps

Researchers believe that ADHD medication may reduce the risk of unnatural-cause mortality by improving impulse control and decision-making. This can lower the likelihood of fatal events, particularly those related to accidental poisoning.

Additionally, ADHD medication has been shown to improve comorbid psychiatric symptoms, such as mood disorders and anxiety. By effectively treating ADHD, it may alter the course of these conditions and reduce the risk of associated health problems.

Potential Risks

While ADHD medication offers benefits, it's important to note that long-term use of stimulant medications may impact cardiovascular health. A previous study found that using ADHD medications was linked to an increased risk of developing arterial disease and high blood pressure.

However, the current study found that ADHD medication was not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality. In fact, female participants who took medication had a reduced risk.

Conclusion

This study provides evidence that ADHD medication can help reduce the risk of premature death from unnatural causes. It also suggests that ADHD medication may have protective effects against natural-cause mortality in women.

While more research is needed to confirm these findings, the study highlights the potential benefits of ADHD medication in improving the health and well-being of individuals with this condition.

Unveiling the Nature of Human Perception: A Child's Perspective

Imagine a world where children's eyes hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of human perception. Researchers at New York University have embarked on a captivating journey to explore the intricate visual models that young minds develop, shedding light on the age-old debate of nature versus nurture.

The Nature vs. Nurture Conundrum

For centuries, philosophers and scientists have grappled with the question of whether our perceptions of the world are shaped by innate biases or molded by our experiences. Some argue that humans are born with a predisposition to categorize and label objects, while others believe that these biases are acquired through interactions with the environment.

A Child's Visual Odyssey

To unravel this enigma, the researchers turned to a unique source of data: headcam videos capturing the visual experiences of young children. These videos provided a window into the unfiltered perceptions of children ages 4-5, a developmental stage when they have already formed sophisticated internal visual models.

Training Artificial Intelligence on Childlike Vision

The team trained state-of-the-art artificial neural networks on this dataset, aiming to mimic the visual representations that children construct from their surroundings. Unlike traditional computer vision models, these neural networks were not explicitly instructed on object recognition or categorization. Instead, they were left to discover patterns and make inferences based solely on the visual input from the child's perspective.

Surprising Discoveries

The results were both surprising and illuminating. The neural networks trained on children's visual experiences performed remarkably well on various object recognition tasks, achieving 70% of the accuracy of models trained on vast datasets of adult images. This suggests that children's visual models are surprisingly robust and capable of capturing essential object features without explicit guidance.

Beyond Object Recognition

Intriguingly, the neural networks also developed a rudimentary understanding of object localization and semantic categories, such as ""animal"" or ""vehicle."" However, their object-centricity was less pronounced compared to models trained on adult data. This difference highlights the unique characteristics of children's visual systems, which prioritize global scene understanding over fine-grained object details.

Implications for Human Development

The findings of this study have profound implications for our understanding of human development. They suggest that object categorization biases are not solely determined by innate factors but are also influenced by the specific visual input that children receive. This opens up new avenues for research exploring the interplay between nature and nurture in shaping human perception.

Future Directions

The researchers emphasize the need for further collaboration between machine learning and developmental psychology. By leveraging advanced algorithms and larger developmental datasets, scientists can delve deeper into the nature of human perception and the role of experience in shaping our cognitive abilities.

Conclusion

The study of children's visual experiences provides a unique lens through which we can explore the fundamental question of nature versus nurture. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, researchers are gaining unprecedented insights into the intricate workings of the human mind, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of how we perceive and interact with the world around us.

Mystery of Dying Sawfish Baffles Florida Scientists

The tranquil waters of the Florida Keys are shrouded in an alarming enigma. A surge in reports of distressed and dying sawfish has sent shockwaves through the scientific community. As of now, 39 of these critically endangered creatures have met their demise, leaving researchers scrambling to uncover the cause of this devastating phenomenon.

A Troubling Discovery

The saga began in November 2022, with reports of erratic behavior among various fish species. Fish were observed spinning disorientingly in the water, primarily at night. The Bonefish Tarpon Trust dispatched a team to investigate, but the situation took a grim turn in late January when the first dead sawfish was discovered. Since then, the number of distressed or deceased sawfish has escalated, raising grave concerns.

An Endangered Species in Peril

Sawfish are a critically endangered species, with only five remaining species globally. The smalltooth sawfish, found in the Florida Keys, was listed as endangered in 2003 due to bycatch and habitat degradation. The recent surge in deaths has scientists baffled, as adult sawfish are typically elusive and mobile creatures.

Investigating the Cause

Initial investigations have pointed to a single-celled algae known to produce ciguatera, a toxin found in reef fish. However, algae expert Mike Parsons emphasizes the complexity of the situation. The toxin's unusual impact on fish, potentially through gill absorption rather than ingestion, presents a novel challenge for researchers.

Local Impact and Community Concerns

The impact of this mystery extends beyond the sawfish themselves. Local ecosystems and fishing communities are also affected. Captain Benny Blanco expresses frustration over the delayed response from state officials, highlighting the detrimental effect on fishing livelihoods.

Hope Amidst the Mystery

Despite the alarming situation, there is a glimmer of hope. During a recent expedition, researchers captured and tagged eleven healthy sawfish near Marathon. This suggests that the cause of the deaths may be localized to a specific area.

Call to Action

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission urges the public to report any sightings of healthy, sick, injured, or dead sawfish. It is illegal to harm, harass, or kill these endangered creatures. If you witness abnormal fish behavior or fish kills, please report them to the FWC's Fish Kill Hotline.

As scientists continue to unravel this ecological puzzle, the community stands united in safeguarding the future of these iconic creatures and the delicate balance of marine ecosystems in the Florida Keys.

The Rise and Uncertain Future of Colin Huang, China's E-commerce Titan

Colin Huang, the enigmatic founder of PDD Holdings, has witnessed a meteoric rise in his wealth, reaching the coveted position of China's second-richest billionaire. However, despite his company's impressive financial performance, a cloud of uncertainty looms over Huang's ability to maintain his lofty status.

PDD's Stellar Performance

PDD Holdings, formerly known as Pinduoduo, has been a beacon of growth in China's tech landscape. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported a staggering 123% year-on-year increase in revenue, reaching a colossal 88.9 billion yuan ($12.5 billion). Net income soared by an equally impressive 146% to $3.3 billion.

This exceptional performance can be attributed to PDD's savvy discount strategy, which has captivated budget-conscious shoppers in China. Additionally, the rapid expansion of its Temu shopping site abroad has further fueled its growth. Temu, launched less than two years ago, now boasts a presence in 50 countries and regions, offering a vast array of discounted products.

Challenges Ahead

Despite PDD's remarkable success, its stock price remains volatile. While the company's fourth-quarter results initially sent its shares soaring, they ultimately closed with a modest gain of 3.5%. Analysts attribute this volatility to several factors that could dampen PDD's outlook.

In China, the first quarter of 2024 is expected to bring a slowdown in e-commerce activity, as the beginning of the year is typically a weak period. Overseas, Temu faces geopolitical risks similar to those encountered by TikTok, the popular short video app. Lawmakers in the U.S. have expressed concerns over TikTok's collection of American user data, raising the possibility of a forced sale or outright ban. Temu, which counts America as a major market, could potentially face similar scrutiny.

Diversification and Profitability

To sustain its growth, PDD must diversify its offerings beyond low-cost goods and venture into the sale of more expensive and branded products. However, the company's progress in this area has been slower than anticipated.

Despite the challenges, PDD remains well-positioned to navigate the uncertain future. The company's vast domestic market provides ample opportunities for growth, and its focus on profitability could offset any slowdown in sales. Analysts predict that PDD's domestic sales will grow by 25% this year, while profit will surge by more than 30%.

Conclusion

Colin Huang's wealth may be vast, but his position as China's second-richest billionaire is not without its vulnerabilities. PDD's stock price volatility and the challenges facing Temu overseas could pose significant threats to his fortune. However, the company's strong domestic presence and focus on profitability offer a glimmer of hope for Huang's continued success. Only time will tell whether he can weather the storms and maintain his position among the elite of China's tech titans.

Bridging the Food Gap: Farm to Feed Empowers Farmers and Tackles Food Loss

Globally, we face a staggering problem of food waste, with a third of all food produced going to waste. In Kenya, this figure is even more alarming, with 20-40% of food lost or wasted. Unlike the developed world, food loss is a more significant issue in Kenya, primarily affecting small-scale farmers.

These farmers, responsible for 75% of the country's agricultural output, struggle with limited market access and stringent cosmetic standards for their produce. As a result, a substantial amount of perfectly edible food goes unsold, leading to economic losses and environmental damage.

Farm to Feed: A Solution for Market Access

To address this challenge, innovative startups like Farm to Feed are emerging. Farm to Feed is an agri-tech company that bridges the market gap for farmers, aggregating their produce, including imperfect crops that may be too small, too large, or oddly shaped. These products, often unwanted by distributors, are sold to businesses like restaurants and food processors through Farm to Feed's sales channels.

Founded in 2021, Farm to Feed was born out of a realization that while food was plentiful, market access was a major obstacle for farmers. Claire Van Enk, the CEO, witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by unsold produce and the impact it had on food security and the economy.

A Holistic Approach to Food Loss

Farm to Feed's approach is comprehensive. They collect produce from farmers across Kenya, sort and grade it, and dispatch it to clients from their warehouse in Nairobi. They also use leased trucks with sustainable cooling solutions to minimize spoilage.

Beyond market access, Farm to Feed is also building a data platform that collects granular data on climate and drivers of food loss. This data will be used to improve farming practices, create a more circular food system, and identify opportunities for value addition.

Exploring New Revenue Streams and Carbon Markets

Farm to Feed is exploring new revenue streams through value-added products and the carbon market. They are currently running a pilot program to create new products from imperfect produce, such as jams and sauces. They are also looking to tap into the carbon market by quantifying emission reductions from reducing food loss and waste. This will allow them to earn carbon offset credits.

A Vital Role in Africa's Food Security

Farm to Feed is part of a growing movement of innovators addressing food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture is a key industry in the region, contributing about 23% of the GDP and employing 60% of the population as smallholder farmers. Startups like Farm to Feed are playing a crucial role in empowering farmers, reducing food loss, and ensuring a sustainable food system for the future.

Meta's Privacy Fee Raises EU Concerns: 'Consent or Pay' Tactic Under Scrutiny

","

The EU's Stance on Meta's Controversial 'Consent or Pay' Tactic

The European Union (EU) has expressed its concerns over Meta's ""consent or pay"" tactic, which forces users to either pay a monthly fee or consent to tracking on Facebook and Instagram. This strategy has raised eyebrows among privacy advocates and consumer protection organizations, who argue that it violates EU laws.

EU's Digital Governance and Competition Rules

The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) aim to regulate digital platforms and ensure fair competition. These laws require platforms to obtain clear consent from users for data processing and prohibit targeted advertising for minors.

Meta's ""Subscription for No Ads"" Offer

Meta's ""subscription for no ads"" (SNA) offer has been met with resistance from the EU. The Commission has requested information from Meta regarding its compliance with the DSA, particularly concerning transparency and potential risks. The EU emphasizes that minors cannot be given the option to opt in to targeted advertising.

Economic Coercion and Consumer Protection

The EU's stance suggests that it views Meta's privacy fee as a form of economic coercion. Consumer law requires that consumers make informed decisions without undue influence. The EU believes that Meta's binary choice between paying or being tracked does not provide consumers with a genuine choice.

Potential Enforcement Actions

The Commission has indicated that it will assess Meta's compliance with the DMA and DSA. Breaches of these regulations can result in significant penalties. The EU could also use the DSA to accelerate the resolution of complaints against Meta.

Conclusion

The EU's position sends a clear message that tech giants must adhere to the spirit and letter of digital governance laws.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-actuator-gen-robots.html,Researchers design a spring-assisted actuator that could enhance next-gen robots, Energy-Efficient Actuators: Powering Next-Gen Robots ,"

Energy-Efficient Actuators: Powering the Robots of Tomorrow

In the realm of robotics, the quest for efficiency is paramount. As machines tackle increasingly complex tasks, from assisting amputees to navigating treacherous environments, traditional electric motors fall short. They struggle to adapt to dynamic movements, wasting precious energy in the process.

Enter the game-changing actuator, a device that harnesses energy to power movement. Researchers at Stanford University have unveiled a breakthrough in actuator design, paving the way for robots that can do more with less.

The Spring-Clutch Symphony

The secret lies in the actuator's ingenious combination of springs and clutches. Springs, known for their ability to store and release energy without consuming it, play a crucial role. When the actuator lowers a heavy object, the springs stretch, absorbing some of the load from the motor.

But here's the clever part: the springs can be locked in their stretched position, effectively storing the energy for later use. This energy can then assist the motor in performing other tasks, reducing its workload and energy consumption.

The key to engaging and disengaging the springs lies in a series of electroadhesive clutches. These clutches, made of two electrodes, slide smoothly past each other when inactive. To engage a clutch, a high voltage is applied, causing the electrodes to snap together with an audible click.

Efficiency Unleashed

The actuator built by the Stanford team features a motor augmented with six identical clutched springs. In a series of rigorous motion tests, this augmented motor outperformed a standard electric motor by a significant margin. It consumed at least 50% less power in every task, with a maximum reduction of 97%.

Implications for the Future

These energy-efficient actuators hold immense promise for the future of robotics. Robots equipped with such actuators could operate for extended periods, expanding their capabilities and impact.

For individuals with disabilities, assistive devices like prosthetics and exoskeletons could become more effective and less reliant on frequent recharging. In hazardous environments, robots could perform tasks that would otherwise be too risky for humans.

The Road Ahead

The researchers are refining the actuator's control system to optimize efficiency even further. They envision a system that learns from past experiences, creating a database of efficient movements and using artificial intelligence to anticipate and adapt to new tasks.

With its potential for commercialization, this breakthrough could revolutionize the robotics industry. It may not be long before we see these energy-efficient actuators powering the robots that shape our future.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/x-launches-top-up-packs-for-its-developer-api/,X launches top up packs for its developer API, X's API Enhancements: Top-Up Packs for Developers ,"

X's API Upgrades: A Boon for Developers

X has unveiled a new solution for developers who exhaust their monthly API post fetch limit: paid top-up packs. For a modest $100, developers can purchase an additional 10,000 posts, allowing them to continue accessing data without interruption.

A History of API Access

Last year, X made waves by restricting free API access and introducing paid tiers. The basic tier, priced at $100 per month, provided a limited number of post fetches. Developers seeking higher limits could opt for the $5,000 per month Pro tier.

The Top-Up Solution

However, the lack of a top-up option left developers frustrated when they reached their monthly limit. They faced the choice of waiting or upgrading to a more expensive tier. The new top-up packs address this issue, providing a cost-effective way to extend access.

Tiered Limits

It's important to note that top-up purchases are subject to tier-based limits. Developers on the basic tier can purchase up to 10 top-ups per month, while Pro tier developers are limited to 5.

Impact on Developers

X's API changes have had a significant impact on the third-party developer ecosystem. Some tools, such as Block Party, have shifted their focus to other platforms. Additionally, researchers have faced challenges in studying the platform's data due to API restrictions. However, X has been compelled to provide access to researchers in the EU under the Digital Services Act (DSA) regulations.

Conclusion

X's new top-up packs offer a welcome solution for developers who need additional API access. By providing a cost-effective way to extend their monthly limits, X is supporting the developer community and fostering innovation on its platform. While the impact of API changes on third-party developers and researchers remains to be seen, these top-up packs are a positive step towards addressing the challenges faced by those who rely on X's data.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-trashed-electric-devices-piling-recycling.html,UN says e-waste from trashed electric devices is piling up and recycling isn't keeping pace," E-Waste Crisis: UN Warns of Piling Problem, Recycling Lags ","

The Growing E-Waste Crisis: A Global Problem with Local Impacts

In the digital age, we rely heavily on electronic devices that make our lives easier and more connected. However, as we upgrade and discard these gadgets, a hidden problem emerges: electronic waste, or e-waste.

The Staggering Scale of E-Waste

According to the United Nations, in 2022, the world generated a staggering 62 million tons of e-waste. This massive amount is equivalent to lining up tractor-trailers filled with discarded electronics around the globe. And it's only projected to grow, reaching an estimated 82 million tons by 2030.

Composition and Value of E-Waste

E-waste encompasses a wide range of discarded devices, including cellphones, laptops, TVs, and even electric cars. Metals, such as copper, gold, and iron, make up half of the e-waste mass, with a combined value of $91 billion. Plastics account for another 17 million tons, while the remaining includes materials like glass and composite materials.

Low Recycling Rates and Growing Concerns

Despite the potential value of e-waste, only about 22% of it was properly collected and recycled in 2022. This low recycling rate is expected to decline further due to factors such as increased consumption, limited repair options, and inadequate waste management infrastructure.

The lack of proper e-waste management poses significant environmental and health risks. Some discarded devices contain hazardous elements like mercury and rare Earth metals, which can leach into the soil and water, contaminating the environment and harming human health.

Regional Disparities in E-Waste Management

Asia generates the most e-waste, but few countries have laws or collection targets. In contrast, Europe has the highest per-capita waste generation and recycling rates exceeding 40%. Africa, on the other hand, generates the least e-waste, but recycling rates remain low at around 1%.

The Human Cost of E-Waste

In developing countries, e-waste often ends up in landfills or is scavenged by individuals who risk their health to extract valuable materials. Steve Okoth, a scavenger at the Dandora dumpsite in Kenya, knows the risks of handling e-waste but has no other option to earn a living.

Solutions and Innovations

To address the e-waste crisis, governments, businesses, and individuals need to work together. Implementing sound regulations to boost collection and recycling is crucial. Additionally, promoting repair and reuse programs can extend the lifespan of electronic devices.

Recycling plants like Nairobi's WEEE center provide safe disposal options for e-waste, ensuring that valuable materials are recovered and harmful substances are disposed of properly.

Conclusion

The e-waste crisis is a global problem that requires urgent attention. By raising awareness, implementing effective policies, and promoting sustainable practices, we can reduce the environmental and health impacts of e-waste while unlocking its potential economic value. It's time to act before this growing problem overwhelms our planet and its people.
