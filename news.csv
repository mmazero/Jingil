Introduction

TikTok, the popular social media platform, is once again under threat of a ban in the U.S., and it's not taking the situation lying down. The company has declared the ban as unconstitutional and has announced its intentions to challenge the decision in court. This move is the latest in a long-standing tussle between TikTok and the U.S. government, raising questions about the app's ownership, data security, and freedom of expression.

The Unconstitutional Ban

On April 24, 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bill giving Chinese parent company ByteDance nine months to divest TikTok or face a ban on app stores to distribute the app in the U.S. TikTok's CEO, Shou Chew, responded by saying the ban is ""actually ironic"" as the app reflects American values of freedom of expression. Chew pointed out that many politicians explicitly aim to ban TikTok, contradicting their claims that the bill is not a ban on the platform or its users' voices.

TikTok's Unique Connection to Users

TikTok has become an integral part of many users' lives, giving them a platform to express themselves and connect with others. Chew emphasized this point by saying, ""TikTok gives everyday Americans a powerful way to be seen and heard, and that’s why so many people have made TikTok a part of their daily lives.""

Previous Attempts to Ban TikTok

This is not the first time the U.S. government has attempted to ban TikTok. In 2020, former President Donald Trump issued an executive order to ban TikTok's operations in the country, including a deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations. Trump also tried to ban new downloads of TikTok in the U.S. and barred transactions with ByteDance after a specific date. However, federal judges issued preliminary injunctions to temporarily block Trump's ban while legal challenges proceeded, citing concerns about violation of First Amendment rights and lack of sufficient evidence demonstrating that TikTok posted a national security threat.

A new study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) reveals that countries with limited renewable energy potential could save up to 20% in costs for green steel and 40% for green chemicals by importing from renewable-rich countries. This 'renewables pull' would incentivize businesses to invest in low-emission production facilities in these countries, while renewable-scarce nations could focus on downstream production and refinement to maintain industrial competitiveness.

The key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in steel and chemical production lies in the use of renewable electricity and green hydrogen. However, not all industrialized countries have the geographical conditions to produce these in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices in the long term. For such nations, importing industrial intermediate goods, like iron sponge, ammonia, or methanol, and focusing on downstream production and refinement could be a more cost-effective strategy.

According to PIK scientist Philipp Verpoort, ""Renewable-scarce countries like parts of the EU, Japan, and South Korea could save between 18 to 38 percent in production costs by relocating their production of industrial basic materials to countries where renewable energy is cheap.""

The researchers analyzed the green value chains of three primary basic materials: steel, urea, and ethylene. They found that an electricity-price difference of 4ct/kWh between some existing renewable-scarce industrial production sites, such as Germany, Japan, or South Korea, and favorable locations elsewhere on the globe, like Australia, Chile, or South Africa, could be expected in 2040. By assessing the cost-effectiveness of various decarbonization strategies, they demonstrated that significant cost savings could be achieved through relocation, and importing hydrogen may not be a cost-effective strategy—especially when imports occur via ship.

The study also highlights other factors that will influence companies' investment decisions, including benefits of short and integrated value chains, reliability of supply chains, quality requirements, and public subsidies for low-emission production. However, these factors alone are unlikely to prevent a partial 'green relocation' of production, given the substantial cost savings presented in the study.

Falko Ullrich, a researcher at PIK, explains the concept: ""Renewable pull means that countries with limited renewable resources can leverage global inequalities to import low-carbon inputs and shift their production to countries with abundant renewable resources. This allows them to maintain their competitiveness while reducing emissions.""

For businesses, the renewables pull concept presents an opportunity to become more sustainable and cost-effective. As the study highlights, investing in low-emission production facilities in renewable-rich countries can provide significant cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

As the world transitions towards a low-carbon economy, the renewables pull concept will play a crucial role in enabling countries to decarbonize their industries while maintaining competitiveness. With the increasing global demand for green steel, urea, and ethylene, the renewables pull will create new opportunities for businesses to invest in sustainable production facilities around the world.

In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly sophisticated, the potential for misuse has become a significant concern. Recently, OpenAI's Sora showcased its ability to generate strikingly realistic videos from simple text prompts. While this technology is undoubtedly impressive, it has also raised concerns about the creation of misleading and deceiving content on a massive scale.

A study from Drexel University reveals that existing methods for detecting manipulated digital media are insufficient against AI-generated video. However, a machine-learning approach has shown promise in unmasking these synthetic creations. This new research, accepted for presentation at the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference in June, introduces a machine learning algorithm capable of identifying digital ""fingerprints"" specific to various video generators, such as Stable Video Diffusion, Video-Crafter, and Cog-Video.

The algorithm can also learn to detect new AI generators after studying just a few examples of their videos. Matthew Stamm, Ph.D., an associate professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and director of the Multimedia and Information Security Lab (MISL), emphasizes the urgency of developing detection technology: ""Responsible companies will do their best to embed identifiers and watermarks, but once the technology is publicly available, people who want to use it for deception will find a way.""

For over a decade, Stamm's lab has been at the forefront of detecting digitally manipulated images and videos. Recently, the group has been particularly busy addressing political misinformation created using photo and video editing programs. The lab's tools use a sophisticated machine learning program called a constrained neural network to identify sub-pixel-level patterns and ""unusual"" traits indicative of manipulation.

However, AI-generated video technology like Sora poses a new challenge. Unlike edited images or videos, AI-generated content is not produced by a camera or photoshopped, leaving standard detection clues absent. To tackle this issue, the MISL team is working to identify new traces left behind by generative-AI programs during video construction.

In the quest for reliable grid-scale energy storage solutions, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have emerged as promising contenders. These batteries, with their high efficiency, scalability, safety, and near-room-temperature operation, offer a promising approach to managing the fluctuations and intermittency associated with renewable energy sources. At the heart of VRFBs are carbon electrodes, whose surface properties play a critical role in determining battery performance. Recently, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have turned their attention to understanding and enhancing the surface functionality of carbon electrodes to extend VRFB lifespans.

The team's research, published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, combines experimental and theoretical approaches to characterize carbon electrodes prepared under different conditions and identify relevant functional groups that contribute to unique spectroscopic features. Central to this work is carbon K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), an analytical technique that provides element-specific local electronic structure and bonding environment information, as well as depth profiling capabilities.

Carbon electrodes' composition and bonding environment are crucial to understanding their electrochemical performance. Wenyu Sun, an LLNL researcher and the first author of the paper, explained, ""Our research identified the active species present on the carbon electrodes, which play a crucial role in determining their electrochemical performance.""

To support and expand on these experimental findings, the team, led by Sabrina Wan, a computational material scientist from LLNL's Quantum Simulation Group, conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These calculations provided XAS signatures of relevant carbon atoms present in the functionalized carbon electrode, both before and after interaction with the vanadium redox complexes in different charge states.

By sampling a vast variety of atomic configurations from DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics, the team identified the thermodynamically most favorable interaction and the corresponding chemical environment. They then constructed a library of XAS spectra for carbon atoms residing in distinct chemical environments, demonstrating that these simulated spectra are powerful for deconvolving ex-situ experimental spectra",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/going-with-the-flow-re.jpg,2024-04-24 12:54:06,"Meta Description:

In the ever-evolving world of wearable technology, the demand for energy storage solutions that can bend, stretch, and twist with soft electronic devices has never been greater. To address this challenge, researchers have turned their attention to micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), which offer high power density, rapid charging, and long cycle life. However, creating interdigitated electrode patterns that can maintain energy storage performance under repeated deformation has proven to be a significant hurdle.

Traditionally, brittle materials like gold have been used as electrodes, making it difficult to achieve the desired level of flexibility. Although eutectic gallium-indium liquid metal (EGaIn) boasts high conductivity and deformability, patterning it into a fine design is extremely challenging due to its high surface tension. This is where a team of researchers from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH) stepped in, developing a groundbreaking method to fabricate MSCs using laser-patterned liquid metal electrodes.

Their study, published in npj Flexible Electronics, details the fabrication of these innovative MSCs on a stretchable polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-polystyrene copolymer (SEBS) substrate. By using laser ablation to pattern both EGaIn and graphene layers, the team was able to maintain the flexibility of the MSC device, even as they stretched it to its limits.

One of the key challenges in working with EGaIn is its high surface tension, which makes patterning it into a fine design extremely difficult. The researchers addressed this issue by using laser ablation, allowing them to create intricate patterns with ease. Moreover, the underlying SEBS substrate remained undamaged during the laser ablation process, ensuring the MSC's flexibility and durability.

The team's MSCs demonstrated impressive performance under various mechanical deformations, including stretching, folding, twisting, and wrinkling.

I've created a succinct and informative SEO title that is under 50 characters while maintaining the key points and facts. The title highlights Rubrik's successful IPO, the rise in share price, and its position as a leader in the cybersecurity industry.","Rubrik, a cybersecurity company, went public on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, debuting at $38 a share. Despite raising $752 million at a price of $32 per share, which gave the company a fully diluted valuation of $6.6 billion, Rubrik's stock settled at $37 a share at the end of trading. The company has 1,700 customers with contracts worth more than $100,000 and 100 customers who pay the company more than $1 million a year.

The venture capital firms most hoping that Rubrik's stock keeps climbing are Lightspeed and Greylock. Lightspeed, which backed the company in five separate rounds and owns 23.9% of Rubrik's shares prior to the IPO, backed Rubrik's Series A round in 2015. Greylock, which led Rubrik's $41 million Series B round in 2016 and participated in the Series C and Series D rounds, holds 12.2% of Rubrik's shares. Other notable investors include Rubrik co-founder Bipul Sinha, who is now the CEO of AI work assistant startup Glean, and Arvind Jain, a co-founder who now holds a 7% stake.

However, Rubrik's debut as a public company was not without its challenges. The company reported that its revenue grew only slightly from $599.8 million to $627.9 million in the past year, while its net losses continued to grow from 46% to 56%. Despite this, subscription revenue made up 91% of the company's revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter, up from 73% the year prior.

Rubrik is the fourth venture-backed company to go public in recent months, following Ibotta, Reddit, and Astera Labs. All three companies popped on the first day of trading and settled into better positions than Rubrik. While the positive debuts of these companies could spark more companies to come off the sidelines, the current guidance that interest rate cuts may not come as early in 2024 as many had predicted may put a damper on the IPO market's recent momentum.

In conclusion, Rubrik's successful IPO marks a significant moment for the cybersecurity industry, as the company's innovative cloud-based security software sets it apart from competitors. With a strong portfolio of high-paying customers and a bright future ahead in terms of subscription revenue, Rubrik is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1410024239.jpg?resize=1200,849",2024-04-25 20:50:42,"""Discover Rubrik's successful IPO!
