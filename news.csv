In a digital world where subscription-based business models reign supreme, companies face a dual challenge: attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Subsets, a Danish startup, aims to bridge this retention gap with an AI-powered platform.

Founded in 2022, Subsets harnesses the power of explainable AI to identify subscribers at risk of churning and provides tailored experiments to entice them to stay. This AI can explain its decisions and insights in a human-understandable manner, addressing the infamous ""black box"" problem often associated with AI.

With notable clients like the New York Times-owned Athletic and Danish newspaper Børsen, Subsets has secured $1.65 million in pre-seed funding led by Nordic VC Upfin and Y Combinator. This investment will fuel the company's expansion and further development of its retention platform.

Subsets focuses on the digital media vertical, helping publishers, streaming platforms, and subscription apps retain subscribers. Companies connect Subsets to their internal systems, allowing the platform to gather subscriber data points like demographics, content consumption patterns, and customer interactions.

Through an intuitive web app, commercial teams can analyze churn audiences and craft retention experiments. These experiments could involve targeted push notifications, email discounts, or free feature upgrades. The platform automates successful experiments, continuously adapting to changing subscriber behavior.

Subsets' AI algorithms employ gradient-boosting models and temporal sequencing methods to understand churn-driving behavior. The company plans to integrate OpenAI's foundational model, the same technology behind ChatGPT, to enhance its downstream functionality.

With half of Y Combinator companies utilizing LLMs, Subsets' investment from YC is a testament to the growing significance of AI in subscription retention. This funding opens doors to new opportunities, including collaborations with YC alumni like the Athletic.

Subsets' mission is to help companies transform their subscription models into recurring revenue powerhouses. By leveraging AI and data-driven insights, the platform empowers businesses to retain customers, reduce churn, and unlock sustainable growth.

The Race for AI Supremacy: A Peek into the Lives of Alibaba and OpenAI Researchers

In the realm of artificial intelligence, a fierce competition is unfolding between tech giants on both sides of the Pacific. Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce behemoth, is among the many companies striving to match the prowess of ChatGPT, the groundbreaking language model developed by OpenAI.

A recent post on X by Binyuan Hui, a researcher at Alibaba's Qwen, offers a rare glimpse into the life of an AI researcher at the company. His daily schedule mirrors that of Jason Wei, an OpenAI researcher, revealing striking similarities in their work routines.

Both Hui and Wei start their day at 9 a.m. and work until 1 a.m., dedicating countless hours to meetings, coding, model training, and brainstorming with colleagues. Even after returning home, they continue to experiment and ponder ways to enhance their models late into the night.

While their work ethic is comparable, their leisure activities differ. Hui spends his free time reading research papers and browsing X to stay updated on global developments. In contrast, Wei enjoys a glass of wine after work.

This intense work regime is prevalent in China's LLM (Large Language Model) space, where top university graduates flock to tech companies to build competitive AI models. Hui's demanding schedule reflects a personal drive to match, if not surpass, Silicon Valley companies in the AI arena.

Renowned AI investor Kai-Fu Lee also exemplifies this dedication. During an interview, Lee revealed that his employees willingly work late hours, driven by the urgency of their mission. One staff member even messaged him at 2:15 a.m. to express excitement about being part of the company's journey.

Alibaba's Qwen team has made significant strides in developing LLMs, releasing a series of foundation models trained with both English and Chinese data. The largest of these models boasts 72 billion parameters, demonstrating its ability to generate contextually relevant responses.

The team has also been quick to introduce commercial applications, integrating Qwen into Alibaba's enterprise communication platform Dingtalk and online retailer Tmall.

While no clear leader has emerged in China's LLM space, Alibaba is carving out a niche with its multilingual approach. In December, the company launched SeaLLM, an LLM capable of processing information in several Southeast Asian languages. This move could become a selling point, given Alibaba's strong presence in the region through its cloud computing business and acquisition of Lazada.

The race for AI supremacy continues, with Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies determined to narrow the gap with OpenAI. As they push the boundaries of AI, the world watches with anticipation, eager to witness the next breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"

In the realm of the internet, a battle is brewing over the fate of content moderation, pitting state laws against the tech giants that shape our online experiences. The Supreme Court finds itself at the center of this digital showdown, tasked with deciding whether two state laws seeking to limit social media companies' content moderation practices can stand.

The cases, one from Florida and the other from Texas, have sparked a heated debate over the boundaries of free speech in the digital age. These laws, crafted by Republican lawmakers, aim to curb perceived anti-conservative bias on social media platforms. However, research has not substantiated these accusations, leaving many to question the motives behind these legislative efforts.

The justices grappled with a complex web of legal precedents, attempting to reconcile outdated laws with the ever-evolving nature of the internet. Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressed concern over the broad scope of the laws, highlighting the potential unintended consequences for various online platforms. Justice Brett Kavanaugh emphasized the First Amendment's protection against government suppression of speech, questioning the states' arguments.

While some justices appeared sympathetic to the states' arguments, others pointed to Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for content moderation decisions. The uncertainty surrounding the cases raises the possibility that the Supreme Court may decline to rule definitively, opting instead to send the cases back to lower courts for further proceedings.

This legal battle underscores the urgent need for the Supreme Court to address the digital age's unique challenges. The existing legal framework, rooted in precedents from traditional media, falls short in addressing the complexities of the internet. The court's decision will have far-reaching implications for the future of online speech and the role of social media companies in shaping public discourse.

As we await the Supreme Court's verdict, the internet age beckons the court to confront its complexities head-on. The outcome will undoubtedly reshape the digital landscape, impacting how we engage with information, express ourselves, and navigate the vast virtual world that has become an integral part of our lives.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/faa-completes-investigation-into-spacexs-second-fiery-starship-test/,FAA completes investigation into SpaceX's second fiery Starship test,"

SpaceX's Starship, a colossal rocket standing tall at nearly 400 feet, has undergone a thorough investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following its second orbital flight test in November. The FAA has accepted the company's findings, which include identifying the root causes of the launch failure and proposing 17 corrective actions.

While the investigation is now closed, SpaceX must implement all the necessary changes and apply for a modified launch license before it can send Starship soaring again. The FAA is currently evaluating SpaceX's license modification request and expects additional information before making a final decision.

The second orbital flight test of Starship was a significant step forward compared to the first test in April. All 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster ignited successfully, and the company executed a challenging ""hot-stage separation,"" where the Starship upper stage ignited to separate from the booster. However, the test ended in a fiery explosion mid-air, prompting the FAA to open a mishap investigation.

SpaceX's investigation revealed seven corrective actions for the booster and ten for the Starship vehicle. These actions include hardware redesigns to enhance robustness and reduce complexity, operational changes to eliminate pre-second engine cutoff propellant dumps, and analytical guidance creation.

In a post-launch analysis, SpaceX delved into the likely root cause of the booster's explosion: a filter blockage in one of the Raptor engines. This failure led to a total loss of the booster. The Starship upper stage encountered its own issues when a propellant leak sparked a fire, severing communication between the spacecraft's computers. This resulted in an engine shutdown and the activation of the autonomous flight termination system, destroying the vehicle.

SpaceX has already incorporated some of these hardware changes and design upgrades into the versions of the vehicle that will be used for the third orbital flight test, which could take place as early as the second week of March. The company aims to complete the full mission profile, including a controlled splashdown of the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico and a landing of the Starship in the Pacific Ocean.

SpaceX's ultimate goal is to develop a fully reusable launch system capable of carrying satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to various orbits and landing sites on Earth, the Moon, and Mars. The company's relentless pursuit of innovation and continuous improvement brings us closer to the era of reusable space travel.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/for-whom-the-ring-tolls/,"The Ring Car Cam appears to be finished, doomed by an unclear target market","

The Rise and Fall of the Ring Car Cam: A Tale of Identity Crisis

In the realm of gadgets, each device is born with a distinct purpose. Toasters brown bread, smartphones connect users, and dashcams record journeys. But the Ring Car Cam, since its inception, has struggled with an identity crisis. After a brief stint in the market, Amazon has finally pulled the plug on this little gadget, leaving many wondering what went wrong.

At its core, the Ring Car Cam aspired to be more than just a surveillance tool. It aimed to be an ever-present sentinel on wheels, extending the home security ecosystem into the automotive space. However, the question of its target audience loomed like an impenetrable fog. Was it intended for security-conscious homeowners, tech-savvy car enthusiasts, or a broader demographic? This ambiguity proved to be one of the device's biggest hurdles.

Startups are often lauded for disrupting stagnant markets, and the Ring Car Cam certainly had the potential to shake up the dashcam industry. But knowing your customers is paramount, and that's where the Ring Car Cam faltered. It tried to straddle multiple domains without gaining a solid foothold in any.

As a dashcam, its $199 price tag and the required $6 monthly subscription for connectivity made it a tough sell. Consumers could easily find high-resolution dashcams at a fraction of the cost.

The Ring Car Cam did boast some innovative features. It utilized the OBD-II port instead of USB and had a ""traffic stop"" mode, allowing users to record interactions with law enforcement. However, these features weren't enough to sway consumers, especially considering that most dashcams record continuously and USB connectivity works just fine.

The Ring Car Cam's appeal was primarily limited to those deeply invested in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. While Alexa has a vast user base, it's hard to imagine many people willing to entrust the safety of their vehicles to a device so heavily reliant on a single platform.

Amazon has remained tight-lipped about whether it has plans to replace the Ring Car Cam, but it seems unlikely that the company can add enough value to the user experience to make it worthwhile, especially in a market where prices are constantly being driven down.

The discontinuation of the Ring Car Cam may also prompt consumers to reassess their expectations regarding dashcams and automotive security devices. As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, drivers are increasingly accustomed to having constant video coverage of their vehicles.

Tesla, for example, promised to make its Sentry Mode more accessible remotely through the Ring Car Connect product. However, after the initial announcement, there was deafening silence. The feature never materialized, and it seems to have vanished from the internet, despite the abundance of Tesla enthusiasts who dissect every move the company makes. The demise of the Ring Car Cam likely spells the end of that project as well.

The Ring Car Cam's story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of clearly defining your target audience and understanding their needs. Without a clear sense of purpose and a compelling value proposition, even the most innovative gadgets can struggle to find their place in the market.

Title: Reddit's IPO: A Unique Opportunity for Power Users and Meme Stock Enthusiasts

In the realm of social media, Reddit stands out as a platform where content thrives thanks to its dedicated community of users and unpaid moderators. Now, as Reddit prepares to make its public debut, it's offering a unique opportunity for these power users to become investors in the company.

Reddit's IPO has sparked excitement among its loyal user base, particularly those with substantial karma, a metric that reflects their contributions to the platform. This select group has been granted early access to purchase shares in Reddit's IPO, a privilege typically reserved for institutional investors.

The decision to invest in Reddit's IPO goes beyond traditional investment considerations. Many users see the potential for Reddit to become the next meme stock, a phenomenon where social media hype and retail investor enthusiasm drive stock prices to dizzying heights.

Communities like r/WallStreetBets have demonstrated their ability to influence the stock market, famously coordinating a short squeeze on GameStop stock in 2021. This rebellious move sent shockwaves through the financial world, costing hedge funds billions of dollars.

The allure of Reddit's IPO extends beyond the possibility of meme stock gains. Some users recognize the platform's potential as a formidable search engine, capable of rivaling established giants like Google. The growing trend of adding ""Reddit"" to Google searches highlights the platform's value as a source of credible and relevant information.

However, Reddit's relationship with its devoted users has faced challenges in recent times. Controversial API changes alienated many communities, leading to widespread protests and a temporary shutdown of thousands of subreddits.

Despite these setbacks, Reddit's offer to include users in its IPO is seen as a gesture of goodwill, acknowledging the crucial role they play in the platform's success.

While some users are enthusiastic about the investment opportunity, others remain skeptical. Concerns about Reddit's profitability and the potential for volatile stock behavior deter some potential investors.

Ultimately, the decision to invest in Reddit's IPO is a personal one, influenced by individual risk tolerance and investment goals. For those willing to embrace the unpredictable nature of meme stocks, Reddit's IPO presents a chance to be part of a unique social media phenomenon.

Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund Launches a New Venture Capital Fund

Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), recently announced the launch of a $1 billion venture capital fund of funds. This initiative aims to draw international VC funds and startups to Qatar and the wider Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The fund will focus on sectors like fintech, edtech, and healthcare.

QIA's fund will invest indirectly through other VC funds and make targeted co-investments with participating funds. The goal is to increase the number of startups and enhance VC funding availability in Qatar, narrowing the gap with neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Gulf sovereign wealth funds have been actively investing in tech startups in the GCC region to reduce reliance on oil and foster thriving venture capital industries. In 2023, Saudi Arabian startups alone raised $1.3 billion. Local venture capital ecosystems are maturing, with only 45% of investors coming from outside the MENA region last year.

QIA's fund is unique in the region as it exclusively focuses on venture capital funds, unlike other initiatives that target private equity funds as well. The fund aims to provide capital for companies beyond seed funding, supporting Series A to Series C funding rounds.

QIA CEO Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud emphasized the importance of diversifying Qatar's economy and ensuring innovative businesses have access to capital and support from VC funds. Fund managers seeking funds from QIA must demonstrate a strong track record and actively participate in the Gulf's VC and startup ecosystem.

This directive aligns with the demands of fund managers and venture capitalists who seek capital from limited partners in the Middle East. QIA has previously invested in ventures like Builder.ai, Reliance Retail, Insider, Airtel Africa, Swiggy, and Flipkart.

QIA's new venture capital fund is a significant step in developing Qatar's startup ecosystem and promoting economic diversification. It will be interesting to see how this fund aligns with the individual investments of sovereign wealth funds that have historically backed foreign startups with minimal connections to the Gulf region.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/lockbit-ransomware-takedown-now-what/,"Feds hack LockBit, LockBit springs back. Now what?","

In the realm of cybercrime, the notorious LockBit ransomware group, known for its relentless attacks, has made a swift return to the dark web after a brief hiatus caused by a comprehensive law enforcement operation. The group's resurgence, complete with a new leak site and a list of fresh victims, raises questions about the effectiveness of the takedown and the resilience of cybercriminal networks.

The LockBit administrator, in a lengthy and somewhat rambling statement, attributed the group's temporary setback to negligence. A global law enforcement effort, dubbed Operation Cronos, exploited a vulnerability in LockBit's public-facing websites, including its dark web leak site, effectively hijacking the ransomware gang's infrastructure.

The operation resulted in the takedown of numerous servers across Europe, the U.K., and the U.S., the seizure of cryptocurrency wallets, and the arrest of alleged LockBit members in Poland and Ukraine. However, just days later, LockBit announced its return, claiming to have restored operations from unaffected backups.

The group's brazen relaunch was met with a defiant statement from the National Crime Agency (NCA), which led Operation Cronos. The NCA asserted that the takedown operation successfully infiltrated and compromised LockBit's systems, effectively dismantling their criminal operation.

Despite the NCA's claims of victory, LockBit's administrator remains at large, issuing threats of retaliation and targeting new victims. The apparent discrepancy between law enforcement's declaration of success and the group's continued activity highlights the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between authorities and cybercriminals.

The NCA's promise to reveal the identity of the group's elusive leader, known as ""LockBitSupp,"" has yet to materialize, further adding to the uncertainty surrounding the group's true status. U.S. law enforcement agencies have offered a substantial reward for information leading to the identification of key LockBit members, suggesting that authorities may lack concrete evidence against the group's leadership.

The resilience of LockBit echoes similar incidents involving other ransomware gangs. ALPHV, also known as BlackCat, faced a similar setback last year when law enforcement seized its dark web leak site and released decryption keys. However, the group quickly recovered, claiming to have regained control of its leak site and leaving thousands of victims with encrypted data.

Other ransomware gangs, such as Hive and Conti, have also faced law enforcement action, only to rebrand and re-form under different names. This pattern of regrouping and rebranding suggests that law enforcement efforts, while significant, may not be enough to permanently dismantle these criminal networks.

LockBit's defiant response to the takedown operation highlights the challenges in combating cybercrime. The group's claims of retaining decryptors, arresting the wrong individuals, and vowing to upgrade its security measures indicate a level of confidence and resilience that should not be underestimated.

While Operation Cronos may have dealt a blow to LockBit's operations, the group's swift return serves as a reminder that the fight against cybercrime is far from over. Law enforcement agencies face an uphill battle in dismantling these sophisticated and adaptable criminal networks, and the ongoing saga of LockBit underscores the need for continued vigilance and collaboration to protect against the evolving threats of ransomware attacks.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/instagram-confirms-developing-snap-map-like-friend-map-feature/,Instagram is working on a 'Friend Map' feature that would let you track friends' locations,"

Instagram is cooking up a new feature called ""Friend Map,"" a digital compass that lets you track your buddies' whereabouts in real-time. Inspired by Snapchat's Snap Map, this opt-in feature is still in its experimental phase, tucked away from public view for now.

If Instagram decides to set this feature free, it'll be the latest in a long line of features borrowed from Snapchat, following the footsteps of the popular Stories format. But Instagram isn't just looking over its shoulder; it's also taking aim at Apple's ""Find My"" feature, which helps you locate your loved ones on a map.

With Friend Map, Instagram aims to keep users glued to its platform, offering another compelling reason to spend more time in its virtual world. It's also a strategic move to attract fans of Zenly, a social mapping app that met its untimely demise last year after being acquired by Snap.

Privacy concerns? Instagram has got you covered. You're in control of who gets to see your location. Share it with your followers, your inner circle of ""Close Friends,"" or keep it all to yourself. And if you need a break from the tracking, simply activate ""Ghost Mode"" to hide your whereabouts.

But Friend Map isn't just about location sharing; it's also a platform for self-expression. Leave short messages, or ""Notes,"" on the map for your friends to discover. Share your excitement about a cool pop-up shop you stumbled upon or recommend a hidden gem of a restaurant you're currently enjoying.

Instagram's recent efforts to enhance its in-app map experience are part of a larger trend. Young users are increasingly turning to social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok for local recommendations instead of traditional search engines like Google Maps.

Instagram, with its massive user base and trove of location data, is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift. Friend Map is just one piece of the puzzle, a strategic move to keep users engaged, connected, and sharing their experiences within Instagram's ever-expanding ecosystem.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/threads-adds-a-bookmarking-feature-for-saving-favorite-posts/,Threads adds a bookmarking feature for saving favorite posts,"

Threads, the Twitter-like app from Instagram, has been evolving to resemble its rival X. Recent updates include trending topics, an in-app camera, drafts, and now, a bookmarking feature.

This new feature allows users to privately save posts for future reference, offering a more discreet alternative to public ""likes."" It's a popular feature among former X users and news enthusiasts, enabling them to curate collections of links and posts for later use.

However, unlike X, where the bookmarking icon is prominently placed at the bottom of each post, Threads users must access the ""Save"" option via the three-dot menu. To view saved posts, users need to navigate to the app's Settings screen.

The rollout of this feature, along with other updates like trends and cross-posting from Facebook, is happening in phases. This gradual approach is due to Threads having fewer engineering resources compared to other Meta projects and its sizable user base of 130 million monthly active users.

Some users have reported receiving notifications from Threads and Facebook in their Instagram notifications. This is another attempt by Threads to expand its user base and integrate more closely with other Meta platforms.

Threads' bookmarking feature provides a convenient way to privately save posts for later reference, catering to users who prefer a more discreet approach than public likes.

In the pursuit of reducing crime and enhancing public safety, technology has emerged as a powerful ally for law enforcement agencies. Among the various technological advancements, Flock Safety has gained prominence with its AI-powered license plate readers, promising to revolutionize crime prevention. However, the company's rapid expansion has been marred by a series of permit violations across multiple states, raising concerns about its adherence to regulatory frameworks.

A Trail of Violations: Unpermitted Cameras and Regulatory Oversights

Flock's mission to combat crime has been accompanied by a string of incidents involving the installation of surveillance cameras without the necessary permits. These violations have drawn the ire of state transportation agencies and local officials, who are responsible for ensuring the safety and integrity of public infrastructure.

In Florida, Flock's cameras were installed on the John's Pass Bridge without the approval of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Despite repeated requests for removal, the cameras remained in place for months, prompting the agency to take action. Similar incidents have occurred in Illinois, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington, where Flock's unpermitted deployments have raised concerns about the company's disregard for regulations.

Permitting: A Vital Process for Public Safety

The permitting process for surveillance cameras is not a mere formality. It serves a crucial role in ensuring the safe and responsible installation of these devices. Permits are granted only after a thorough review to assess potential hazards, such as the risk of cameras falling and causing accidents or interfering with utility lines. By neglecting the permitting process, Flock has jeopardized public safety and demonstrated a lack of regard for established guidelines.

The Company's Response: Excuses and Evasions

In response to inquiries about these violations, Flock spokesperson Josh Thomas has attempted to downplay the significance of the incidents, attributing them to occasional paperwork slip-ups and jurisdictional complexities. However, the sheer number of violations and the company's repeated failure to comply with regulations suggest a systemic issue rather than isolated errors.

A Call for Accountability: Legislators Step In

The growing chorus of complaints against Flock's permit violations has prompted lawmakers to take action. In South Carolina, State Representative Todd Rutherford has introduced a bill that would establish clear guidelines for the deployment of license plate readers, addressing the concerns raised by Flock's unpermitted installations. Similar legislative efforts are underway in other states, reflecting the urgent need for oversight and accountability.

The Path Forward: Compliance and Respect for Regulations

Flock's mission to reduce crime is commendable, but it cannot come at the expense of public safety and regulatory compliance. The company must acknowledge the severity of its permit violations and take immediate steps to rectify the situation. This includes obtaining the necessary permits for all existing installations, working closely with transportation agencies to ensure compliance, and implementing robust internal processes to prevent future violations.

Only through a commitment to transparency, accountability, and adherence to regulations can Flock regain the trust of state officials, local communities, and the public at large. The company has a responsibility to operate within the bounds of the law and to prioritize the safety and well-being of the communities it serves.

The Enduring Strength of Brick-and-Mortar Auto Dealerships

In an era of digital transformation, many predicted the demise of traditional car dealerships, envisioning a future where vehicles would be bought and sold entirely online. However, a recent study by Urban Science reveals a surprising trend: not only have physical dealerships survived, but they've also shown signs of growth.

The 2023 Automotive Franchise Activity Report (FAR) found that the number of U.S. auto dealerships increased slightly in 2023, from 18,257 to 18,347. This modest increase may seem insignificant, but it bucks the trend of declining dealerships predicted by many industry experts.

While the number of dealerships grew, the number of franchises, or brands offered by those dealerships, decreased slightly from 31,554 in 2022 to 30,504 in 2023. This consolidation may reflect a shift towards larger dealerships offering a wider range of brands under one roof.

Despite these fluctuations, the overall picture is one of stability in the auto dealership landscape. Mitch Phillips, director of global data at Urban Science, attributes this stability to the adaptability of dealers, who have weathered economic downturns, supply chain disruptions, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the most remarkable findings of the study is the increase in throughput, or the number of vehicles sold by each dealership per year. After a dip during the pandemic, throughput has rebounded, reaching 851 vehicles sold per dealership in 2023. This increase in sales volume is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of dealers, who have embraced digital tools and innovative sales strategies to meet the changing needs of consumers.

However, increased volume does not necessarily translate to increased profits. A report by J.D. Power indicates that retailer profit per unit has declined in recent months due to rising inventory and fewer vehicles selling above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).

As the automotive industry transitions towards electrification, dealerships face a new challenge: adapting their operations to sell and service electrified vehicles. Phillips advises dealers to carefully analyze sales data trends before making major investments in EV infrastructure, but emphasizes the importance of being prepared to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles.

Despite the rise of online car sales platforms, brick-and-mortar dealerships remain the preferred choice for many consumers, especially Millennials. According to Phillips, Millennials value the in-person experience of visiting a dealership, test-driving vehicles, and interacting with knowledgeable sales staff.

In conclusion, the auto dealership industry has proven to be more resilient than many predicted. Dealers have adapted to economic challenges, technological advancements, and changing consumer preferences, demonstrating their ability to thrive even in uncertain times. As the industry continues to evolve, dealerships will need to continue embracing innovation and adapting to new trends to maintain their relevance and success.
