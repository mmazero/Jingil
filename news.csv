Similarly, public health often goes unnoticed, which is why a new TV series called The Invisible Shield aims to shed light on its importance. The four-episode series will debut on PBS on March 26 at 10 pm and aims to raise awareness about public health and its impact on individuals and communities.

The title of the series, ""The Invisible Shield,"" reflects the fact that the public health system and its professionals work diligently every day to protect people from various health threats. Unfortunately, public health often goes unnoticed amidst discussions about celebrities, politicians, and unnecessary products. As Dr. Kelly Henning, the Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, explains, ""The better public health works, the less likely you are to see it."" It is disheartening that this ""invisible shield"" has been deteriorating for years, and most people are unaware of it due to the system's invisibility.

The Covid-19 pandemic should have exposed the chronic underfunding, underappreciation, and vulnerability of public health systems. With more resources and support, the public health system could have saved countless lives and reduced suffering caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although political and business leaders briefly acknowledged these issues, they soon shifted their focus elsewhere. Some leaders even worsened the situation by spreading misinformation and disinformation about public health. Despite the temporary attention garnered by public health during the pandemic, the necessary resources did not follow. This begs the question: What will it take for society to realize the urgent need for stronger support of the public health system? Must we wait for a disaster larger than the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent collapse of the public health system? It is akin to waiting for a building to burn down before considering the installation of smoke alarms, fire extinguishers, and sprinklers.

To prevent further disasters, RadicalMedia produced the series ""The Invisible Shield"" with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. The aim is to draw attention to public health amidst the constant self-promotion of celebrities, influencers, politicians, and businesses. The absence of marketing machines for public health often leads to underestimating its significant impact on our lives. Consider the accomplishments of public health, such as vaccination, antibiotics, clean water supplies, and anti-pollution efforts. Without these advancements, would you even be alive today to fall for the hype surrounding various products? As Dr. Josh Sharfstein, Distinguished Professor of the Practice at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, states in the trailer for ""The Invisible Shield,"" ""Public health saved your life today, but you didn't even know it.""

Four episodes are not nearly enough to fully depict the contributions of public health over the years. However, the first episode, ""The Old Playbook,"" will explore how public health has doubled life expectancy since 1900. It also highlights the current risks faced by the public health system. The episode delves into how the system attempted to apply lessons from past epidemics and pandemics to combat Covid-19.

In conclusion, ""The Invisible Shield"" is a TV series that aims to bring attention to the critical role of public health. By highlighting its achievements and current challenges, the series seeks to raise awareness among the general public. Public health is an essential aspect of our lives, and without its contributions, our well-being would be compromised. So, tune in to the series and discover the invisible shield that has been protecting us all along.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08,"Meta Description: Discover the invisible shield of public health in the TV series ""The Invisible Shield.""

Gen AI enterprise leaders will gather for a night of insights and conversations. Request an invite now to secure your spot.

This week, we have a special guest who is an expert in company building. Ray Rike, a founding member of the SaaS Metrics Standards Board, will be joining us. His team manages the industry's largest SaaS benchmarking Index, which includes data from over 18,000 unique SaaS companies and more than half a million data points. If you want to run a business with discipline, efficiency, and reliability, Ray is the person you need to know.

During our CarCast, we will dive into various topics including growth, profit, customer acquisition, churn metrics, and the five metrics that every exceptional CEO and operator should know. Ray will provide valuable insights and advice based on his extensive experience.

In addition to our upcoming event in Boston, we are excited to announce the AI Impact Tour stop in Atlanta on April 10th. This invite-only event, in partnership with Microsoft, will explore how generative AI is transforming the security workforce. Space is limited, so make sure to request an invite today.

Now, let's discuss some important metrics that every business should be aware of:

1. The Rule of 40: This metric helps you evaluate the health of your business by considering the balance between growth and profitability. It suggests that the sum of your growth rate and profit margin should be at least 40%.

2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Ratio: This metric helps you understand how much it costs to acquire a new customer. By comparing your marketing and sales expenses to the number of new customers gained, you can determine the effectiveness of your acquisition efforts.

3. CAC Payback Period: This metric calculates the time it takes for your business to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. It is a crucial indicator of your business's financial health and sustainability.

4. Net Revenue Retention (NRR)/Gross Revenue Retention (GRR): These metrics measure your ability to retain and grow revenue from existing customers. NRR considers expansion revenue, while GRR only focuses on the base revenue. Both metrics provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction and long-term business growth.

5. The CLTV:CAC Ratio: This ratio compares the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) to the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). It helps you assess the profitability of acquiring and retaining customers. A higher ratio indicates a healthier business model.

During the CarCast, I challenged Ray to share his top 10 priorities for running a successful business. However, I pushed him to focus on just the number one priority, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and clear focus.

Lastly, I recommend checking out the latest research from McKinsey and Company on setting up your generative AI tech stack. They provide eight steps to consider:

1. Assess your company's readiness for adopting generative AI.
2. Identify use cases that can add value through improved productivity, growth, and new business models.
3. Rethink your technology function to align with the adoption of generative AI.
4. Leverage existing services or adapt open-source generative AI models to accelerate implementation.
5. Upgrade your enterprise technology architecture to effectively integrate and manage generative AI models.
6. Develop a robust data architecture to ensure access to high-quality data for training and testing generative AI models.
7. Establish a centralized, cross-functional team dedicated to managing your generative AI platform.
8. Create tailored upskilling programs for employees based on their roles and proficiency levels.

We hope you find these steps helpful in navigating the world of generative AI technology.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse, Solar Eclipse vs. Lunar Eclipse: Explained ,"Do you know the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? These celestial events are fascinating to witness and hold a special place in astronomy. In the next few weeks, we have the opportunity to witness two eclipses—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. While these phenomena are distinct from each other, they share a common factor—the alignment of celestial bodies.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow is cast onto the moon. On the other hand, a solar eclipse happens when the moon obstructs the sun's light, creating a shadow on Earth. Both types of eclipses are relatively rare due to the subtle differences in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

Let's delve into the causes of these captivating events. A lunar eclipse can only occur during a full moon, when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. Full moons happen roughly every 29 days, but lunar eclipses are infrequent because the moon rarely passes through Earth's shadow.

In contrast, a solar eclipse can only transpire during a new moon, when the moon is situated between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow onto our planet. New moons occur every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon. However, the moon's alignment with the sun in a way that it obstructs its light from Earth is a rare occurrence.

Now, let's explore the causes of total lunar and solar eclipses, which offer breathtaking sights. During a total lunar eclipse, the sun, Earth, and moon align perfectly. Earth possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the central umbral shadow. When a full moon enters Earth's umbral shadow, it receives no direct sunlight. Instead, the moon is illuminated by sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This creates a mesmerizing effect, with the lunar surface turning a pinkish-red hue, leading to the term ""Blood Moon."" If you were on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would witness a beautiful pinkish-red glow, along with the possibility of observing a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will experience a penumbral lunar eclipse, as the full ""Worm Moon"" will pass through Earth's penumbra—the lighter outer part of the shadow.

Total solar eclipses, on the other hand, occur when there is a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, along with a celestial coincidence. A new moon also possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When a new moon perfectly blocks all of the sun's light—a phenomenon only possible due to the moon's size (400 times smaller than the sun) and proximity to Earth (400 times closer)—its umbral shadow is projected onto our planet.

The moon's shadow moves across the Earth's surface as it orbits from west to east, which coincides with the direction of Earth's rotation. This alignment reduces the speed of the moon's shadow, resulting in an umbral shadow path or ""path of totality."" Those within this path have the privilege of witnessing a total solar eclipse—a truly extraordinary event. If you were standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would witness the moon's shadow crossing over Earth.

On April 8, we will have the opportunity to observe a total solar eclipse, as the new ""Pink Moon"" will perfectly block the sun's light and project an umbral shadow over North America.

Now, you may be wondering why lunar and solar eclipses are rare. The answer lies in the inclination of the moon's orbit around Earth, which is approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. This means that the moon's path intersects with the sun twice during each orbit, which occurs monthly. However, for a solar or lunar eclipse to transpire, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This alignment happens twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" during which solar and lunar eclipses always occur. However, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (""ring of fire""), while lunar eclipses are primarily penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead, let's explore the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024 and 2025:

2024 Eclipses:
- March 25: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)

Introduction:
Have you ever witnessed a total solar eclipse? If you think you have, chances are you're mistaken. Total solar eclipses are rare events that leave a lasting impression on those lucky enough to experience them. In this article, we will delve into the world of total solar eclipses, debunk common misconceptions, and explore the upcoming event that promises to captivate millions across North America.

Debunking Misconceptions:
Many people believe they have seen a total solar eclipse when, in reality, they have only witnessed a partial eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur frequently throughout the year, but the awe-inspiring totality is a different story altogether. To truly experience a total solar eclipse, one must be within the path of totality, where the moon completely obscures the sun. If you're unsure whether you have seen a true total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify your memory.

The Great American Eclipse:
North America has been fortunate enough to witness several total solar eclipses in recent years. One of the most notable was the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017, which brought totality to 12 U.S. states, spanning from Oregon to South Carolina. This celestial phenomenon attracted millions of people, leaving an indelible mark on those lucky enough to be in its path. The sight of the sun's corona shining amidst a twilight-like sky is an experience of a lifetime.

Verifying Your Memory:
If you believe you have witnessed a total solar eclipse but are unsure, there are ways to confirm your recollection. By identifying the location and date of your memory, you can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database to determine whether it was indeed a total solar eclipse. This database provides an interactive map of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America in the last 70 years, allowing you to ascertain the true nature of your experience.

The Path of Totality in 2024:
While partial solar eclipses are visible to everyone in North America, only a select few will have the opportunity to witness totality on April 8, 2024. This rare event will traverse a narrow 115-mile path through parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada. From Sinaloa, Mexico, to Newfoundland, Canada, millions will gather to bask in the awe-inspiring beauty of a total solar eclipse. Clear skies and wide eyes will be the order of the day.

Conclusion:
Total solar eclipses are a celestial spectacle that leaves an everlasting impression on those fortunate enough to witness them. While many mistakenly believe they have experienced a total eclipse, the truth is that true totality is a rare occurrence. North America has been blessed with recent opportunities to witness these extraordinary events, and the upcoming total solar eclipse in 2024 promises to captivate millions. So, when you come across someone who thinks they've seen a total solar eclipse, gently enlighten them about the wonders that await them in the future.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent, UFC Fighter Severino Disqualified for Biting Opponent ,"Pressure and combat sports can push athletes to do things that seem completely out of character. The most recent example of this occurred at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas, where Igor Severino made his UFC debut and shocked everyone by biting his opponent, Andre Lima, in the second round of their preliminary bout. This bizarre and unacceptable behavior led to Severino's disqualification and has put his future in the promotion in serious jeopardy.

The incident occurred during a standing grappling position, with Severino behind Lima. The bite marks were clearly visible in the images that confirmed the incident. It's unfortunate that Severino, who is only 20 years old, had the potential to make a name for himself in the UFC. However, his actions on Saturday night have cast a shadow over his career prospects in the organization.

Severino's loss to Lima marked the first defeat of his professional career, dropping his record to 9-1. In contrast, Lima remained undefeated at 8-0. The severity of Severino's actions prompted UFC CEO Dana White to make the swift decision to cut him from the promotion. White expressed his disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you get frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but the worst thing you can do is bite your opponent. Now, you get cut and lose the biggest opportunity of your life. Not to mention, he’s going to have real problems with the NSAC.""

Biting incidents in combat sports are not unheard of, but they are always met with strong condemnation. In this particular case, Lima displayed remarkable composure after being bitten. He calmly informed the referee about the incident, which prompted a brief investigation into the violation. Severino's actions have not only cost him his immediate future in the UFC but have also damaged his reputation. He will likely have to rebuild his career with smaller promotions before he can even think about competing in reputable mixed martial arts organizations such as the UFC or the Professional Fighters League.

As the events of Saturday's fights in Las Vegas come to a close, we can expect more traditional results to be announced. It is disheartening to see such unsportsmanlike conduct tarnish an otherwise exciting night of fights. It serves as a reminder that athletes must maintain a level of professionalism and respect for their opponents at all times, regardless of the pressures they face in the heat of competition. Biting is a clear violation of the rules and goes against the spirit of fair play that is essential in combat sports.

Let us hope that incidents like this serve as a lesson for young fighters and remind them of the importance of integrity and sportsmanship. As fans, we expect exciting and competitive fights, but we also expect fighters to conduct themselves with honor and respect. It is through these qualities that the sport can continue to grow and thrive.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,"Meta Description: ""Severino's shocking bite incident at UFC Fight Night results in disqualification and jeopardizes his future in the promotion.

Apple's AI Plans for the iPhone: A Potential Partnership with Google and Baidu

As the anticipation builds for Apple's upcoming AI plans for the iPhone, it seems that the tech giant is looking to strengthen its position through potential partnerships. In addition to a rumored collaboration with Google, Apple is reportedly in talks with China's Baidu to further enhance its AI capabilities.

While flagship Android devices have been making strides in promoting generative AI, Apple's iPhone 15 family has fallen behind in the market. Although AI features can be found in certain software aspects of iOS, such as image processing and predictive text input, generative AI will not be introduced until the next version of the operating system. Fortunately, iOS 18 is expected to launch this summer at the Worldwide Developer Conference, coinciding with the release of the next-generation iPhone 16 family.

Apple, like many smartphone manufacturers, will focus on on-device and in-the-cloud AI processing. Leveraging its reputation for prioritizing data security and privacy, Apple aims to keep as much user data on the device as possible for local processing. However, for AI applications that require extensive processing power, the cloud will be utilized.

To achieve this, Apple is reportedly exploring a partnership with Google and its Gemini generative AI service. Despite being a competitor in the mobile operating system space, Apple and Google have collaborated in various areas, such as Google being the default search engine on iOS. By joining forces, Google stands to benefit from the millions of AI-using iPhone owners, which would bolster its own AI system.

However, there is a hurdle to overcome. Due to regulatory restrictions and vetting processes for generative AI modems, Google's Gemini service is not available in China. As a result, Apple has initiated negotiations with Baidu to include its cloud-based AI services in the upcoming iOS 18 and iPhone 16 family. This partnership would allow Apple to tap into Baidu's expertise and provide AI capabilities specifically tailored for the Chinese market.

Apple is not alone in pursuing such collaborations. Samsung, during its recent Galaxy Unpacked event, unveiled the new Galaxy S24 family along with its own Galaxy AI services, some of which rely on Google Gemini. Similarly, to offer AI services in China, Samsung has partnered with Baidu.

It will be interesting to see how Apple distinguishes its AI services from its rivals when they are built on the same underlying technology. With the advancements in AI technology, competition in this space is fierce, and companies must find ways to differentiate themselves to attract users.

In conclusion, Apple's foray into AI for the iPhone is an exciting development that aims to catch up with its Android counterparts. By potentially partnering with Google and Baidu, Apple is seeking to leverage their expertise and resources to enhance its AI capabilities. With iOS 18 and the next-generation iPhone 16 family on the horizon, Apple is poised to make significant strides in the AI landscape.

The details of the partnership are yet to be determined, but this could be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts are fully developed. It will be interesting to see how this collaboration unfolds and what it means for the future of AI on mobile devices.

Moving on to hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is rallying an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of this coalition were previously involved in the same business they are now fighting against. This highlights the complexity of the cybersecurity landscape and the need for collective action to address these issues.

In gaming news, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed that they did it for fun and to draw attention to an exploit used in the game. This incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced in the gaming community regarding security and fair play.

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, is facing criticism as users report that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to affected users is to delete their accounts entirely. This raises concerns about privacy and the need for platforms to prioritize user consent and security.

In the world of funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start. The stock, which launched at $34 a share, saw a 48% jump on its first day of trading. This demonstrates the growing interest in Reddit and its potential as a social media platform.

Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also had a successful IPO. With revenue growing by 45% to $115.8 million last year, Astera Labs saw its stock close at $62.03 on its first day. This success is a testament to the growing demand for cloud computing solutions and the role of connectivity in this space.

But before we dive into the puzzle, let me confess something: I have a secret desire to make rabbit pot pies on Easter one day. The deliciousness of the dish combined with the irony of eating rabbit on a holiday that celebrates bunnies seems too good to pass up. But for now, let's focus on Wordle.

If you're new to Wordle, it's a word puzzle game that has gained popularity recently. I've been writing guides for it for a few weeks now, and it's been a lot of fun. If you're interested, you can find today's guide on my blog.

Now, let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle. Here are the hints and clues you need:

Hint: Useful when dry, useless when wet.
Clue: Today's Wordle begins with a consonant.

Spoiler alert! If you want to solve the puzzle on your own, skip the next part.

My initial guess was ""chain,"" which left me with a whopping 681 possible words. But then I realized that ""slope"" could be a better fit, and it brought the number down to a more manageable 19. I decided to go with ""below"" as my final guess, and to my surprise, it was correct! Maybe it was just a lucky coincidence, or maybe it was the influence of today's Strands puzzle. Who knows?

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score for today is a total wash. I guessed in four attempts and didn't tie with the Wordle Bot, so I ended up with zeros all around. But hey, there's always tomorrow!

Now, let's take a moment to explore the etymology of the word ""towel."" It has an interesting history that dates back to the 13th century. The term originated from the Old French word ""touaille,"" which eventually made its way into English. The Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia"" is believed to be an intermediate step in this linguistic journey, derived from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" This evolution in language reflects the everyday use and significance of towels, which were initially used for drying or wiping.

The transformation from ""touaille"" to ""towel"" showcases the linguistic influences of Norman French on the English language after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. As time passed, many words of French origin underwent pronunciation and spelling changes to become Anglicized. This is how we ended up with the modern English word ""towel."" Throughout the centuries, towels have evolved in terms of material and usage, but their core purpose of drying or wiping has remained unchanged.

The rapid advancement of AI technologies has brought about a new era of AI-generated content, including hyper-realistic images, videos, and texts. While this progress is impressive, it has also given rise to a flood of potential misinformation and deception, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish truth from fabrication.

The sheer volume of AI-generated content is staggering. Since 2022, AI users have created over 15 billion images, surpassing what humans were able to produce in 150 years prior to that. This influx of generative AI imagery and content is already impacting how we perceive the internet, and it is forcing historians to view the post-2023 internet as something completely different.

One concerning consequence of AI-generated content is the emergence of deepfakes. These are counterfeit content created using machine learning algorithms that mimic human expressions and voices. OpenAI's recent preview of Sora, their text-to-video model, showcased how virtual reality is becoming indistinguishable from physical reality at an alarming pace.

To address these growing concerns, tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI have proposed solutions to mark AI-generated content and identify its artificial origins. Meta, for example, plans to label images created with its AI tools on platforms like Facebook and Instagram using visible markers, invisible watermarks, and detailed metadata. Similarly, Google and OpenAI aim to embed 'signatures' within the content generated by their AI systems. These efforts are supported by The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), an open-source internet protocol that aims to trace the origins of digital files and differentiate between genuine and manipulated content.

While these initiatives are well-intentioned and aim to promote transparency and accountability, we must ask ourselves if they go far enough. Can universal detection be achieved without empowering those who have access to exploit it? Who gets to decide what is considered real? These questions pose significant challenges that need to be addressed before we can fully trust these solutions.

The Edelman Trust Barometer, which examines public trust in technology and innovation, reveals a significant skepticism towards how institutions manage innovations. People globally are more likely to believe that innovation is poorly managed rather than well managed, and there are concerns about the rapid pace of technological change not benefiting society as a whole. This skepticism extends to the introduction and regulation of new technologies by businesses, NGOs, and governments, as well as concerns about the independence of science from politics and financial interests.

Building trust in innovation is crucial if we want watermarking and similar solutions to be effective. However, this is a challenging task. As technology advances, so do the capabilities of the problems it aims to solve. Reversing the lack of trust in innovation requires addressing public concerns and demonstrating the benefits of these advancements.

In conclusion, the rise of AI-generated content has brought both excitement and concern. While efforts are being made to mark and trace the origins of such content, there are still significant challenges to overcome. Trust in innovation and transparency in content creation are essential for navigating this new era of AI technology. Only by addressing these concerns can we ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI-generated content.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_bank_safe_with_a_brain_bursting_out_of_it_vib-tcfzKaqpY-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-23 18:05:00,Discover the challenges of AI-generated content in the digital era.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing, Mallard Bay: Online Marketplace & SaaS Platform for Guided Hunting and Fishing ,"Americans spent a significant amount, over $144.8 billion, on fishing and hunting in 2022, according to a survey conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, the process of booking guided hunting and fishing excursions has remained outdated, with bookings made over the phone and payments made by physical checks or cash. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this industry by providing an online marketplace for consumers to book guided tours, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, Mallard Bay offers a vertical SaaS platform for outfitters to manage their operations online and access additional services like marketing.

In recent news, Mallard Bay announced a successful funding round, securing $4.6 million in a Series A funding led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. Logan Meaux, co-founder and CEO of Mallard Bay, shared that the idea for the company came after a disappointing hunting trip with his father during his college days. The trip was double-booked, resulting in a crowded hunting experience where Meaux did not even get a chance to shoot. Drawing from his experience working for his father's startup, Waitr, Meaux saw an opportunity to create a company that addresses the inefficiencies in the hunting and fishing industry.

Initially, Mallard Bay's goal was to create a marketplace similar to Airbnb for booking guided hunts. However, after consulting with outfitters and guides, the team realized that they needed to offer more value to encourage guides to join their platform. This led to the development of Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back-office solution for outfitters. The team discovered that outfitters, while receptive to the idea of adopting online platforms, lacked the business expertise to make the transition smoothly. Mallard Bay's domain expertise and passion for both the outdoors and software development proved to be valuable in bridging this gap.

The platform gained traction when hunting influencer Toby Brohlin joined, leading to more outfitters signing up. Brohlin alone has generated over $1 million in gross bookings, and the platform as a whole facilitated over $6 million in gross bookings in 2023. Mallard Bay is projected to reach $30 million to $35 million in gross bookings in 2024.

Despite the company's growth and the potential of the hunting and fishing industry, Meaux faced challenges in securing investments. It took conversations with over 270 investors to raise the recent funding round. Many investors were unfamiliar with the category and had negative perceptions about hunting. Mallard Bay had to emphasize that their platform focused on ethical hunting and fishing practices and their commitment to conservation. Hunting and fishing, when done ethically, contribute to wildlife conservation by promoting sustainable practices and wildlife management.

While hunting and fishing may not be commonly discussed in the startup and tech ecosystem, Mallard Bay's success caught attention. The concept of Hunting SaaS is unique and intriguing. It is worth noting that Mallard Bay is not the only hunting-related company to raise funding recently. HLRBO, an online platform that simplifies the process of finding hunting land leases, raised a $1 million seed round in February.

Mallard Bay's impressive growth since its launch in 2021 is another notable aspect. The company experienced a 600% year-over-year increase in bookings, which is remarkable in a niche market like hunting and fishing. This growth highlights the potential of niche markets and disproves the misconception that they are too small to be profitable.

The hunting and fishing industry is just one part of the larger outdoor activities market in the U.S., which amounts to over $394 billion. However, many of these industries still rely on offline processes or outdated technology. As an example, I recently encountered difficulties when trying to find parking for a popular hiking trail in Sedona, Arizona. I had to search through multiple blogs to determine if a parking pass was required. This highlights the need for improved technology and online platforms in various outdoor activity sectors.

In conclusion, Mallard Bay is revolutionizing the hunting and fishing industry by providing an online marketplace for booking guided tours and offering a back-office solution for outfitters. The company's recent funding round demonstrates investor confidence in its potential. Mallard Bay's success in a niche market and the broader outdoor activities industry highlights the opportunities for innovative tech solutions in these sectors.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Revolutionize hunting and fishing with Mallard Bay's online marketplace.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone, Google Unveils Revolutionary Satellite Messaging Feature ,"Android and iPhone, the two leading smartphone ecosystems, are becoming more similar with each passing day. Recently, Google has been making strides to bring Android closer to the iPhone, from enhancing security to incorporating WhatsApp calls and Apple passes. However, the latest update from Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature but surpasses it, outshining Apple at its own game.

Previously, I reported on Google's efforts to introduce an emergency satellite service to Android, which would finally bring satellite SOS functionality to the platform, something that Apple has offered for a few years now. But Google's offering goes beyond that, including a ready-made Garmin rescue service. This is a significant advancement in terms of safety and security for Android users.

One drawback of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only intended for emergencies. This means that for those of us who are not mountaineers or sailors, the SOS tag on the screen when there is no coverage is essentially useless. However, with the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging this gap by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. Additionally, core messaging apps will be able to utilize the satellite network, eliminating cellular black spots and ensuring connectivity even in remote areas.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 features UI elements that provide a consistent user experience for devices with satellite connectivity. The update also introduces a new API that allows apps to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Furthermore, Android 15 enables SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The highlight of this update is the integration of messaging apps with satellite connectivity. It is worth noting that some networks have plans to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option. This is an improvement from what was initially expected when Google prematurely added a ""Satellite SOS"" feature to Pixel phones, placed between Car Crash Detection and Emergency SOS.

Apple's satellite connectivity, on the other hand, is more limited. With certain iPhone models, users can connect to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when there is no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further, with previous beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in collaboration with T-Mobile. The potential for this feature became more apparent when Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had achieved download speeds of 17mbps on an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra. According to SamMobile, this means that smartphones would be able to make/receive calls and messages directly from a satellite, even in areas where there is no cellular network coverage. Starlink has been testing such a service, and it may be available in the coming months.

While we wait for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity to become more common and usable, the integration of satellite messaging is a promising start.

The confirmation that Android 15 will include this feature is a significant development. It seems that Google is taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini, a major player in the cryptocurrency world, could be coming to the iPhone. Additionally, Apple claimed that the DOJ lawsuit against it would essentially turn the iPhone into Android. It has been an eventful week indeed.

Update 3/23: Exciting new details about Google's satellite messaging plans have emerged shortly after the news broke about Gemini potentially coming to the iPhone to power AI updates in iOS 18.

This development is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, it further narrows the gap between Android and iPhone, making them more similar than ever. Secondly, it significantly enhances Google's presence within the iPhone ecosystem.

This is just one example of Android moving faster than iPhone. Gemini's deployment on Android devices is another instance where Android is taking the lead. While Apple users await more information about the next OS update in the fall, Android continues to make strides in innovation.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,"Meta Description (under 18 words): ""Google's latest Android update surpasses iPhone, offering satellite connectivity for enhanced safety and messaging capabilities.""

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,These ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization, ADHD Medications Lower Suicide & Hospitalization Risk ,"<h3>ADHD Medications Linked to Lower Risk of Suicide and Psychiatric Hospitalizations
</h3>
A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included 221,714 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also found that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers observed that four ADHD medications, namely amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate, were linked to a decreased risk of being hospitalized due to psychiatric co-morbidities. Additionally, a decreased risk of suicidal behavior was associated with the use of lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate.

A previous study conducted in Sweden in 2019 revealed that individuals with ADHD had a prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity of 52%, compared to only 7% among individuals without ADHD. Psychiatric co-morbidities include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. The 2019 study also reported that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among individuals with ADHD, especially when substance use disorder was present.

While the ADHD medication atomoxetine was not found to be linked to a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, the researchers did find an association between atomoxetine and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers noted that there is considerable evidence that ADHD medications, especially stimulants, improve functioning and quality of life in addition to addressing core ADHD symptoms. However, the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies are still not fully understood.

To investigate the association between specific ADHD medication use and the risk of psychiatric hospitalization, the researchers included individuals between the ages of 16 to 65 years old who had received an ADHD diagnosis in Sweden between 2006 and 2021. The study participants' healthcare data, including inpatient and outpatient records, were collected from the Swedish National Patient Register. The researchers were also able to track the participants' prescribed ADHD medication purchases through the Prescribed Drug Register.

Methylphenidate was the most commonly used ADHD medication among 68.5% of the study participants, followed by lisdexamphetamine (35.2%) and atomoxetine (15.6%). The study participants were followed up for 15 years, and it was found that 56% of them had a psychiatric comorbidity, with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders being the most common ones. Approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

Interestingly, while lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older, methylphenidate seemed to be less effective among older adults. The researchers suggested that methylphenidate may be less effective among individuals aged 30 years or older, or there may be some kind of initial effect that diminishes with longer-term use, age, or course of illness. Atomoxetine was found to be linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

Overall, the study found that ADHD medications had a beneficial effect on psychiatric outcomes, with a decreased risk of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric hospitalizations. However, the researchers highlighted concerns about the potential adverse effects of long-term stimulant use, including increased blood pressure and heart rate, as well as the risk of cardiovascular diseases, seizures, and possibly psychosis or mania.

The study was published online in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024.

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of suicide and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Meta Description: ADHD Medications Linked to Lower Risk of Suicide and Psychiatric Hospitalizations.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/liquid-death-vc-beverage-startup-coke-pepsi/,Liquid Death is just one of many VC-backed beverage startups ready to disrupt Coke and Pepsi, VC-Backed Liquid Death & Other Beverage Startups Disrupting Coke and Pepsi ,"Liquid Death and other venture-backed beverage startups are making waves in the industry, challenging established players like Pepsi and Coke. Despite the challenges of the capital-intensive beverage industry, these startups are attracting funding and disrupting the market with innovative approaches.

Liquid Death, a canned water company, recently raised $67 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $267 million. This success is notable considering the lack of interest from investors in the beverage sector. However, Science Ventures saw the potential of Liquid Death to disrupt the market and redefine the category.

One strategy that some beverage startups are employing is creating new drink categories. By approaching the industry differently and drawing inspiration from other sectors, these startups are finding success.

This approach has allowed them to tap into a larger market and gain popularity.

Another trend in the industry is the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives. Many consumers, especially Gen Z, are choosing to drink less alcohol but still want to have fun. Startups like Not Beer are capitalizing on this trend by offering premium sparkling water brands that provide a healthier alternative to alcohol. These brands are well-positioned to cater to consumers who want to enjoy a drink without the negative effects of alcohol.

In addition to water and non-alcoholic options, startups are also exploring beverages that feature vitamins, minerals, supplements, and botanicals. Companies like Odyssey are infusing their drinks with ingredients known for their cognitive and energy-boosting effects. This focus on functional beverages is gaining traction and attracting investment.

Other beverage startups that have received significant funding include Olipop, Poppi, and Lemon Perfect. These companies have raised over $50 million in venture funding and have gained market share with their better-for-you soda alternatives. Their success highlights the demand for healthier beverage options.

In a crowded market with numerous options, standing out is crucial. Brands need to differentiate their drinks within the category and also showcase why their beverages are better than alternatives. This requires a strategic approach and effective marketing to capture consumers' attention and loyalty.

Overall, the beverage industry is experiencing a wave of disruption from venture-backed startups.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.," EPA Cuts Tailpipe Pollution, Promotes Clean Car Options ","On red air days, when pollution levels are unhealthy, it's important to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses. But have you ever wondered what the leading cause of toxic air is in most places?

It turns out that internal combustion engines fueled by gas or diesel are major contributors to air pollution. In fact, more than two-thirds of Americans rely on personal automobiles for their day-to-day travel. This means that transportation is now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with light-duty vehicles alone responsible for nearly 60% of the pollution in this sector.

So, how do we tackle this pervasive air pollution problem? The answer lies in cutting tailpipe pollution from the cars we drive. Fortunately, we have a tool that can help us achieve this goal: tailpipe emissions standards. These standards ensure that vehicles are equipped with the latest clean technologies, making them cleaner and better for the environment.

Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took a significant step in addressing this issue by adopting new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These rules limit tailpipe pollution, which not only poisons the air we breathe but also contributes to climate change. The updated standards require automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

It's important to note that everyone should have the choice to make their next car a clean car. As individuals who care about reducing pollution, we deserve the option to drive electric vehicles. Electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions, making them an excellent choice for those who want to make a positive impact on air quality.

However, there are some who view these pollution limits as a threat. Corporations that profit from selling vehicles and petroleum see these standards as a hindrance to their businesses. They argue that these standards infringe on American freedoms and consumer choice. But the truth is that these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by cleaning the air we breathe and providing consumers with more sustainable options.

Take, for example, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, who have launched a major campaign aimed at informing Americans about the Biden administration's efforts to ban new gas, diesel, and flex fuel vehicles from the market. Their goal is to manipulate the public into thinking that these standards are unnecessary and will limit consumer choice. However, this is simply not true.

By law, the EPA does not have the power to ban technologies or modes of transportation. The agency's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and informed by scientific research. The Clean Air Act, signed into law in 1970, authorizes and directs the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and welfare. It also empowers the EPA to regulate emissions from vehicles and engines, adapting the standards over time.

The earliest standards for light-duty vehicles required a 90% reduction in emissions from hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. These standards drove the development of new engine and emission control technologies, such as the catalytic converter, and led to the switch to unleaded fuel. As a result, our cities no longer choke on air pollution like they used to. Before the Clean Air Act, breathing in New York City's air was equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day, and Los Angeles suffered from unhealthy air pollution for more than 200 days a year.

In conclusion, it's clear that reducing tailpipe pollution from vehicles is crucial in addressing our air pollution problem. The EPA's adoption of new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles is a significant step in the right direction. These standards will ensure that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before, benefiting both our health and the environment. It's time for us to embrace cleaner technologies and make the choice to drive electric vehicles. Let's breathe easier and create a cleaner future for all.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,"Meta Description (18 words): Discover how cutting tailpipe pollution and adopting cleaner technologies can create a cleaner future for all.
