In brief, this article discusses how MIT engineers revolutionized muscle-powered robots using their newly designed flexure springs, which enhance the efficiency of these biorobotic systems. These springs enable more precise control over muscle contractions, opening doors for various applications in different industries like medical diagnostics and assistive devices.","Title: A New Era of Muscle-Powered Robots: The Flexure Spring Revolution

Introduction

In recent years, scientists and engineers have been captivated by the idea of harnessing the incredible potential of natural muscles to power robots. After all, our muscles possess remarkable properties, including impressive strength, precision, self-healing capabilities, and growth through exercise. However, designing efficient biohybrid robots using natural muscles remains a complex challenge due to the lack of a universal blueprint for optimizing muscle performance across various designs. Enter the groundbreaking research conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) engineers, who have developed a revolutionary spring-like device called the ""flexure"" that significantly enhances the efficiency of natural muscle-actuated robots. This innovative invention offers immense promise for creating adaptive and versatile biomechanical machines tailored to diverse applications. Let us delve deeper into this exciting development!

A Skeletal Foundation for Biohybrid Robots

Imagine a highly adaptable, modular system capable of serving as a fundamental framework for virtually any muscle-driven robot. That is precisely what the MIT team envisioned, leading to the creation of the novel flexure spring. Designed to maximize the effectiveness of any attached muscle tissues, this ingenious component amplifies the range of motion achievable by a single muscle contraction up to fivefold compared to previously existing designs. With this technology, engineers can construct customizable artificial skeletons compatible with various configurations, paving the way for a myriad of intriguing possibilities.

Maximizing Muscle Power

To appreciate the significance of the flexure spring, it is essential to understand the limitations associated with conventional approaches to converting muscular forces into controlled motions. In isolation, muscle tissue tends to exhibit erratic behavior, moving unpredictably without proper guidance. To address this issue, engineers often secure bands of muscle tissue between two flexible posts, enabling the muscle to function similarly to a mechanical actuator. While this setup facilitates rudimentary movement, its primary drawback lies in the inconsistency of muscle interactions with the supporting structure. Depending on factors such as placement and contact area, the same muscle might either successfully bring the posts closer together or cause excessive lateral oscillations.

The MIT team aimed to develop a skeleton specifically engineered to focus and magnify a muscle's contractions, thereby generating consistent motion irrespective of minor variations in attachment. By incorporating a specialized spring mechanism connecting the posts, the researchers ensured that the resulting motion remained directed and uniform, effectively transforming raw muscular force into purposeful action.

Design Principles Behind the Flexure Spring

At its core, the flexure spring embodies several critical principles geared towards achieving optimal conversion of muscular effort into controlled linear displacement. Firstly, the spring must remain incredibly pliant in the desired direction of travel yet offer substantial resistance against transverse deformation. Secondly, the connection between the muscle and the spring-supported posts needs to accommodate slight misalignments, allowing for seamless interaction despite imperfect positioning. Finally, the overall geometry of the flexure assembly must facilitate simple integration with additional modules, fostering scalability and flexibility in crafting sophisticated structures.

An Exciting Future Awaits

With numerous practical advantages over traditional methods, the flexure spring represents a monumental stride forward in developing next-generation biohybrid robots. Its inherent simplicity, ease of manufacturing, and compatibility with standard microfabrication techniques render it accessible and affordable for widespread implementation. Moreover, the unprecedented level of consistency achieved by combining the flexure spring with natural muscle tissue opens up infinite opportunities for innovation in fields ranging from medical diagnostics to wearable exosuits.

Introduction

Depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs may soon serve a new purpose: storing carbon-free hydrogen fuel. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are utilizing computer simulations and lab experiments to explore the potential of repurposing these subterranean formations for hydrogen storage. With its versatile applications ranging from generating electricity and powering heavy industries to fueling zero-emission vehicles, hydrogen emerges as a promising candidate for sustainable energy storage. However, challenges persist concerning its low energy density and cumbersome compression methods compared to conventional fossil fuels. To address these concerns, scientists like Matthew Paul and Tuan Ho are investigating whether abandoned oil and gas reserves present a viable solution for large-scale hydrogen storage.

The Advantages of Storing Hydrogen Underground

As a clean fuel source, hydrogen offers numerous benefits including generation via solar or wind power, utilization in fuel cells for transportation purposes, and provision of backup energy during periods when renewable energy production wanes. Seasonal and long-term energy demands can also be met by storing surplus hydrogen produced during high-production seasons (e.g., summer) and releasing it during times of increased consumption (e.g., winter). Nevertheless, limitations remain – notably, the lower energy per unit volume compared to traditional carbon-based fuels like methane and propane, along with inherent difficulties associated with compressing hydrogen gas. As a result, mass storage of hydrogen in aboveground metal tanks proves impractical.

Underground Options: Salt Caverns vs. Depleted Reservoirs

Existing options for subsurface hydrogen storage include salt caverns, yet these geological features are unevenly distributed throughout the United States. In light of this constraint, researchers like Don Conley and Tuan Ho seek alternative solutions among depleted oil and gas fields. Their goal? Determining whether hydrogen stored within these former extraction sites remains safely confined, prevents leakage, and averts contamination risks.

Studying Leakage and Contamination Risks

To understand how hydrogen behaves within various types of host rock, Ho's team first investigated whether the gas would adhere to or escape from sandstone and shale formations commonly encountered in oil and gas reservoirs. Preliminary studies revealed that hydrogen readily desorbs from sandstone upon depressurization but becomes trapped within shale samples, accounting for approximately 10% of total absorbed gases. Further exploration led to the discovery of minimal hydrogen losses resulting from migration through certain clays prevalent in shales surrounding reservoirs. Specifically, montmorillonite clay exhibited negligible attraction towards hydrogen molecules relative to water-filled spaces between mineral layers.

While initial findings suggest favorable conditions for hydrogen storage within shale formations, additional verification experiments are ongoing at Stevens Institute of Technology and the University of Oklahoma. Furthermore, Ho's team continues examining possible contaminants introduced during hydrogen injection processes, focusing primarily on residual natural gas release from rock matrices and subsequent blending with hydrogen supplies. Future research efforts aim to assess interactions between spent oil residues and incoming hydrogen, providing valuable insights to optimize large-scale field trials of underground hydrogen storage facilities.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/studying-the-subterran.jpg,2024-04-09 16:40:41,"""Discover how depleted oil & gas reservoirs transform into carbon-free hydrogen storage hubs.

","Title: Unraveling the Impact of Prompt Variations on Large Language Models

Introduction

Have you ever wondered how slight modifications in the way you phrase questions to language models like ChatGPT might affect their responses? A team of researchers sought to explore this curiosity and investigate the extent to which prompt variations could influence large language models' (LLMs') predictions. This study reveals fascinating insights regarding the intricate relationship between prompt design and model behavior. Let's dive into the details.

Four Categories of Prompt Variations

To examine the reliability of LLMs' responses to variations in prompts, the researchers focused on four distinct categories:

1. Requesting responses in particular output formats, such as lists or CSV files
2. Making minor adjustments to the prompt, such as inserting extra spaces or using polite phrases
3. Employing ""jailbreaks"" to circumvent content filters for handling sensitive subjects
4. Offering various amounts of tips to elicit improved responses

Testing Across Benchmark Text Classification Tasks

These prompt variations were examined through 11 benchmark text classification tasks – standardized sets utilized in NLP research to gauge model performance. Each prompt variant's frequency of resulting prediction changes and impacts on the LLM's accuracy were assessed.

Key Findings

The results illuminate several interesting trends related to LLM predictive behaviors in relation to prompt variations:

1. Adding specified output formats caused noticeable shifts in upwards of 10% of LLM predictions.
2. Introducing minor perturbations resulted in fewer changes compared to specifying output formats, yet remained substantial; e.g., a simple space added at the beginning or end of a prompt yielded over 500 (of 11,000 total) altered predictions.
3. Utilizing jailbreaks drastically increased the likelihood of changes depending on the type of jailbreak applied.
4. No individual formatting or perturbation approach proved optimal for all tasks; however, not specifying a format generally produced higher overall accuracy, surpassing alternative methods by approximately one percentile.
5. Tipping had negligible consequences on performance improvements, whereas employing jailbreaks disclosed potential for considerable accuracy losses.

Conclusion

Understanding the interplay between prompt design and LLM behavior offers valuable information for optimizing interactions with AI systems like ChatGPT.

Introduction

In a groundbreaking study, a team of researchers led by Professor Sung-Kyun Jung at UNIST's School of Energy and Chemical Engineering has uncovered a novel method to enhance the thermal stability of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). This discovery has set a new standard for safe battery systems, paving the way for a more secure and reliable energy storage solution.

The Challenge: Conventional Lithium-Ion Batteries

Conventional lithium-ion batteries, which utilize organic liquid electrolytes, have long been associated with a high risk of fire and explosion. This inherent danger has driven the research community to explore alternative battery systems, focusing on ASSBs that employ non-flammable inorganic solid electrolytes.

The Emergence of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes

Sulfide solid electrolytes have emerged as promising materials in the pursuit of next-generation solid-state batteries. However, these materials have been plagued by challenges related to thermal instability, caused by exothermic reactions and explosive decomposition products at the interface between sulfide solid electrolytes and electrode materials.

The Solution: Halide-Based Solid Electrolytes

To address these challenges, the research team investigated the use of halide-based solid electrolytes as a means to enhance thermal stability. By substituting sulfide solid electrolytes with halide counterparts, such as Li 3 InCl 6 , the team observed improved oxidation stability and reduced oxygen evolution from the cathode.

Creating a Composite Material for Enhanced Thermal Stability

The research team created a composite material combining Li 3 YCl 6 (LIC) with a charged cathode material (Li 1-x Ni 0.6 Co 0.2 Mn 0.2 O 2 ), known as NCM622.

Introduction

Nonlinear systems play a crucial role in numerous fields, from robotics to economics. Despite their wide applicability, nonlinear systems present significant challenges due to their complex behavior and intricate mathematical models. One notable approach addressing these difficulties is the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system, utilizing fuzzy logic to simplify complex nonlinear dynamics. By approximating nonlinear systems as multiple linear ones, T–S fuzzy systems enable efficient modeling and control design. Although extensively studied, there remains room for improvement regarding optimal control techniques in the realm of T–S fuzzy descriptor systems (FDSs).

A New Era of Control Strategies

Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui of Shibaura Institute of Technology, along with colleagues Thi-Van-Anh Nguyen, Quy-Thinh Dao, and Duc-Binh Pham from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, tackled this challenge through innovative optimal and robust-optimal controllers grounded in T–S FDSs. These new controllers aim to improve overall control performance while accounting for external perturbations.

Harnessing the Power of Lyapunov Stability Theory

To create the desired controllers, the researchers employed the potent Lyapunov stability theory. They initially determined stability conditions tailored specifically to the mathematical model of the FDS; however, applying these conditions proved computationally challenging. Therefore, they ingeniously converted these stability conditions into Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs)—simpler forms solvable via standard mathematical approaches.

Creating Three Advanced Controllers

Utilizing the newly established LMI-based stability criteria, the researchers crafted three advanced controllers:

1. Stability Controller (SC): Leveraging the Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC) strategy, SC focuses on managing discrepancies and maintaining equilibrium.
2. Optimal Controller (OC): OC aims to minimize a predefined cost function associated with control actions, resulting in optimized solutions.
3. Robust-Optimal Controller (ROC): ROC synergistically incorporates advantages from both SC and OC, providing resilience against disturbances while simultaneously striving for optimal outcomes.

The authors validated their innovations by testing each controller on a rotary inverted pendulum—a demanding setup consisting of an inverted pendulum placed upon a revolving platform. The primary objective involved keeping the pendulum vertical through precise manipulation of the platform's rotation.

Simulation Scenarios Demonstrating Superior Performance

Each controller underwent rigorous examination across varying simulation settings:

1. Initial Displacement Angle Variation: Utilizing the Stability Controller resulted in successful stabilization when the pendulum started slightly off its balanced position. Nevertheless, larger starting angles triggered greater oscillations and longer settling times.
2. High Settling Time Reduction: Implementing the Optimal Controller significantly decreased the settling time from 13 to 2 seconds—representing an impressive six-fold enhancement. Furthermore, it diminished peak amplitude levels during oscillatory periods.
3. Disturbance Resistance Test: Two separate tests evaluated ROC's capacity to counteract disruptions: altering the pendulum rod's mass and adding white noise to the control signal. While ROC exhibited comparable performance in the former situation, it greatly outperformed the Optimal Controller concerning resistance to random fluctuations. Impressively, ROC showcased minimal oscillations compared to subpar performance by the Optimal Controller.

Drones have emerged as valuable tools in various industries, including agriculture, construction, and utility inspections. However, their limited battery life remains a significant hindrance to their widespread adoption. A group of researchers at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) sought to address this challenge by designing drones capable of recharging directly from power lines. Their pioneering work recently enabled a quadcopter to inspect and charge from power lines for five consecutive cycles over two hours.

Power line inspection represents one potential application where these self-charging drones could excel. SDU researchers initially introduced a self-charging drone prototype in 2022; however, recent improvements focused primarily on enhancing the gripper mechanism while demonstrating practical applications for the technology.

To achieve this feat, the research team modified a Tarot 650 Sport drone, incorporating an electric quadcopter propulsion system, an autopilot module, and additional components necessary for autonomous functionality. Once the drone's systems recognize critically low battery levels, its advanced camera and millimeter-wave radar system spring into action. These sensors enable the detection of nearby power lines, allowing the drone to navigate towards them accurately.

As detailed in a forthcoming presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the drone approaches the identified power line from below via specially designed inward-sloping arms. Upon reaching the target, the drone securely grips the power line, establishing contact between an inductive charger and the electrical source. After replenishing its energy reserves, the drone releases the power line and resumes its mission.

During testing, the SDU-developed drone successfully completed five charging sessions during a continuous two-hour flight—a remarkable achievement considering previous limitations imposed by battery capacity. As stated in the researchers' conference abstract, this innovation marks ""a first-in-the-world system with the ability to sustain operation throughout many inspection/charging cycles powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment"" (University of Southern Denmark).

Such advancements pave the way for extended drone operations without constant human intervention or tethered power sources. By enabling drones to harness electricity from existing infrastructure like power lines, organizations stand to benefit from increased efficiency and reduced downtime when deploying unmanned aerial vehicles. While further developments will undoubtedly fine-tune this groundbreaking technology, the future appears bright for autonomous drones soaring overhead, charged and ready for action.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1IoQGbhjTRiRLCh1kV9o6g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzM-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/a0d17cb0-f5c5-11ee-bdbd-2ba28a625ccf,2024-04-08 16:39:42,"""Autonomous drones charge from power lines for continuous inspections - revolutionizing industry operations.""
