In the latest episode of the crypto wars, UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) director general, Graeme Biggar, has urged Meta (formerly Facebook) to reconsider its rollout of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Instagram. This appeal follows a joint declaration by European police chiefs, including the UK's, expressing concerns about the expanding use of E2EE by tech companies and its impact on identifying and reporting illegal activities.

The NCA's Biggar highlighted the challenge in protecting the public from organized crime while ensuring child safety, emphasizing the need for information access. Currently, platforms can send tens of millions of child safety-related reports annually to global police forces, resulting in the safeguarding of 1,200 children and the arrest of 800 individuals monthly. However, Meta's E2EE expansion to Instagram may hinder this process.

Despite supporting encryption to ensure privacy and cybersecurity, Biggar insisted that tech companies should develop solutions to provide law enforcement with necessary information. This stance aligns with the joint declaration, which calls for the industry to adopt unspecified technical solutions to maintain the ability to spot and report illegal activities while preserving robust security and privacy.

The declaration does not explicitly mention client-side scanning, but it seems to be the suggested technology. Apple planned to roll out such a system in 2021 for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on devices, but privacy and legal concerns led to its postponement. The European Council has also adopted a resolution for lawful access to encrypted data, while the European Commission proposed a controversial message-scanning CSAM legislative plan.

Although parliamentarians revised the Commission's proposal to limit the scope of CSAM detection orders, the European Council has not yet reached an agreement. In response, over 60 civil society groups and privacy experts warned that the proposed ""mass surveillance"" law remains a threat to E2EE, and EU lawmakers agreed to extend a temporary derogation from the bloc's ePrivacy rules, allowing platforms to perform voluntary scanning for CSAM.

Artificial intelligence has been making waves in various industries, and now it's making a bold entrance into the world of coffee. A Helsinki-based artisan roastery, Kaffa Roastery, in collaboration with local AI consultancy Elev, has introduced an innovative coffee blend called ""AI-conic."" This unique concoction is the first of its kind, developed with the help of artificial intelligence, in a trial aimed at easing the workload in a sector that traditionally cherishes manual labor.

Finland, a nation of 5.6 million people, is renowned for its coffee consumption, with an impressive average of 12 kilograms per capita annually. It is only fitting that this groundbreaking blend was launched in the heart of this coffee-loving country. The AI-conic blend is a harmonious mixture of four types of beans, predominantly Brazil's velvety Fazenda Pinhal, with additional flavors from Colombia, Ethiopia, and Guatemala.

The collaboration between Kaffa Roastery and Elev involved leveraging AI models similar to ChatGPT and Copilot. These models were tasked with creating a blend that would cater to coffee enthusiasts' tastes, pushing the boundaries of conventional flavor combinations. The AI was supplied with detailed descriptions of all Kaffa's coffee types and their flavors. It was then instructed to craft a new, exciting blend, which resulted in the creation of the AI-conic blend.

Interestingly, the AI chose to create the blend using four different types of coffee beans, a decision that surprised Kaffa Roastery's founder, Svante Hampf. Traditionally, coffee blends use two or three types of beans to allow for distinct taste variations between origins. However, after the initial test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa's coffee experts agreed that the AI-assisted blend was perfect and required no human adjustments.

The AI didn't just stop at crafting the blend; it also designed the package label and created a detailed taste description. According to the AI, the AI-conic blend offers a well-balanced sweetness and ripe fruit flavors. Hampf admits to being initially surprised by the four-bean blend but was",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-coffee-roastery-in-f.jpg,2024-04-21 05:41:40,"""Experience the AI-conic coffee blend - a unique, AI-generated symphony of flavors.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/20/house-passes-tiktok-ban-again/,U.S. House passes revised bill to ban TikTok or force sale,"

The U.S. House passed a bill forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban. The nine-month window for divestiture is a response to concerns about potential data collection for the Chinese government. The bill received broad support and is now in the Senate's hands. This situation highlights the complex balance between national security, data privacy, and digital rights.

","

Title: The TikTok Dilemma: Balancing National Security and Digital Rights

The U.S. House of Representatives has recently approved a bill that could either force ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban within the United States. This development is reminiscent of efforts initiated during the Trump Administration, which have resurfaced in recent months.

In the current bill, TikTok's parent company is granted a nine-month window to sell the popular app, with an additional 90-day extension allowed at the President's discretion. This adjustment appears to have addressed some Senate objections, with Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) suggesting the extension to ensure a more likely divestiture.

The bill received widespread support, passing with a 360-58 majority, and is part of a larger package also containing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. The inclusion of the TikTok bill might have been a strategic move to garner more conservative support. If the Senate adopts the package and it receives President Biden's approval, TikTok is expected to challenge the decision in court.

Both the Biden Administration and House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Michael McCaul (R-Texas) have expressed concerns about the app. They cite potential data collection on American users for the Chinese government and the use of TikTok as a propaganda channel. McCaul even referred to the app as ""a spy balloon in Americans' phones."" However, TikTok has previously denied these allegations.

The company, in response to the revived bill, released a statement asserting that the House is attempting to ""trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform."" Likewise, civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union have previously opposed app ban efforts.

This situation raises complex questions about national security, data privacy, and digital rights. While addressing national security concerns is crucial, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of a ban on American users, businesses, and free speech. As the situation unfolds, striking a delicate balance between these competing interests will be paramount.

This online governance and content moderation framework aims to ensure that tech companies prioritize user safety and privacy. The EU has expressed concerns about TikTok Lite, a new version of the app launched in France and Spain, which features a ""task and reward"" mechanism that could negatively impact the mental health of young users.

The EU has given TikTok until April 24 to respond to the allegations, but the app remains accessible for now. Penalties for confirmed DSA violations can reach up to 6% of a company's global annual turnover. As a result, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, could face hefty fines if found guilty of breaking the law.

This second probe focuses specifically on TikTok Lite, following an ongoing investigation into multiple aspects of the platform's DSA compliance since December. The EU is concerned that ByteDance failed to conduct and submit a risk assessment report before launching the ""Task and Reward Lite"" program, particularly regarding its impact on mental health, especially among minors.

The EU has accused ByteDance of failing to produce the requested risk assessment document, which could lead to fines of up to 1% of the company's total annual income or worldwide turnover, as well as periodic penalties of up to 5% of average daily income or worldwide annual turnover.

The DSA applies stricter regulations to larger platforms, requiring them to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks. The EU suspects that ByteDance failed to comply with these requirements before launching TikTok Lite in the EU markets.

Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the Internal Market, released a statement emphasizing the importance of protecting children from potential harm caused by excessive screen time and addictive app features. He warned that the EU would take action against TikTok if the company fails to provide compelling proof of the app's safety.

As of press time, ByteDance had not responded to the EU's latest enforcement action.

Seraphim Space, a UK-based venture capital group specializing in space technology, has announced the launch of its second VC fund. Having already made nine investments, the new fund, SSV II, aims to raise a significant sum, surpassing the £70 million ($90 million) raised by its predecessor in 2017. The fund will focus on early-stage startups working on seed and Series A rounds, with the goal of creating a global portfolio of 30 companies.

Fund Details and Strategy

Although CEO Mark Boggett declined to disclose the current percentage reached or the targeted size of the new fund, he confirmed that it should be larger than the first fund. The fund's strategy remains consistent, targeting investment in space tech startups with significant potential for growth and innovation.

Working with major players in the aerospace sector, Seraphim Space aims to help these established companies stay connected to emerging trends and technologies. While the market for space tech has become increasingly competitive and attracted more interest from generalist and specialist investors, Seraphim Space hopes to distinguish itself through its strong track record and industry expertise.

Track Record and Success Stories

Seraphim Space's first fund has already demonstrated success, returning three times the original investment. This success was driven in part by five exits, including the trade sale of UltraSoC to Siemens and the IPOs of Arqit, AST SpaceMobile, Nightingale, and Spire Global.

However, recent market conditions have affected both the firm's portfolio companies and Seraphim Space itself. The firm's growth fund, Seraphim Space Investment Trust (SSIT), listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2021 with £250 million in gross proceeds but has since experienced a decrease in market capitalization due to challenging public market conditions, especially for tech listings.

Investment Themes and Focus Areas

SSV II will focus on four key themes: the application of AI to space data, in-orbit computing, space-enabled communications, and microgravity for science.

Introduction:

Venture capital activity in Africa has shown resilience amidst a global funding winter, with major firms on the continent closing their funds. TLcom Capital, an African VC firm with offices in Lagos and Nairobi, recently concluded fundraising for its second fund, TIDE Africa Fund II, totaling $154 million, becoming the largest investor across seed and Series A stages in the continent.

The Final Close and Participating Investors:

TLcom Capital's TIDE Africa Fund II had an initial target of $150 million and attracted over 20 limited partners. Notable investors include the European Investment Bank (EIB), Visa Foundation, Bertelsmann, and AfricaGrow, a joint venture between Allianz and DEG Impact. Managing partner Maurizio Caio highlighted an improved understanding and acceptance of venture capital in Africa among limited partners as a legitimate asset class, which contributed to the successful fundraising.

Consistent Investment Strategy and Focus on Early-Stage Opportunities:

Unlike many VC firms that progress from backing startups in pre-seed and seed stages to later-stage investments with subsequent funds, TLcom maintains a consistent strategy. The firm focuses on traditional sectors like fintech, mobility, agriculture, healthcare, education, and commerce, prioritizing early-stage opportunities, particularly at the seed and Series A stages. TLcom has deployed capital in follow-on rounds at later stages across both funds, with successful investments in Andela, a unicorn provider of global job placement for software developers, and FairMoney, a Nigerian digital bank.

Backing Repeat Founders and Investing Earlier in Deals:

TLcom has improved its risk by backing repeat founders who have gained insights from past ventures. The firm has also invested earlier in deals, such as its pre-seed investments in Autochek and Okra, and its $5 million pre-seed strategy to be disbursed in small check sizes with a low-touch approach. This strategy creates a pipeline to its primary strategy at seed and Series A stages.

In the era of high-tech phone cameras with countless features and granular controls, there's something undeniably appealing about the simplicity and nostalgia of old-school photography. This is the idea that inspired developer Alex Fox to create Mood.camera, a unique iPhone app that captures the essence of retro photography while offering a fresh and fascinating user experience.

At first glance, Mood.camera might seem like any other photography app, allowing users to switch between different retro filters, adjust quality and tone, and switch between lenses. However, it's the app's distinct approach to image processing that sets it apart. Unlike most modern camera apps, Mood.camera does not provide a live preview of the final image. Instead, users see the same viewfinder as they would in their default camera app, creating an element of surprise and anticipation when the photo ""develops.""

Fox designed Mood.camera with the intent to shift the focus back to the art of photography itself, rather than getting caught up in the effects and editing process. In an interview with TechCrunch, he explained, ""Some of the design decisions I made were intended to reduce the conveniences we're used to, urging users to be in the moment instead of worrying about which filter to use or staring at their phone editing.""

The app's development began in October 2023, with a beta version released on Reddit earlier this year. Over the last two months, a group of photographers have taken more than 100,000 photos using Mood.camera, helping Fox refine and perfect the app. Users can try Mood.camera for free for seven days, after which they can choose to pay a monthly fee of $1.99 or a one-time fee of $14.99.

Mood.camera isn't the first app to attempt to recreate the magic of retro cameras. In recent years, apps like Lapse, Dispo, and Later Cam have also tried to capture elements of vintage photography by imposing limitations on their functions. While some of these apps have attracted investors and gained popularity, their growth has eventually slowed down.

However, Mood.camera's indie developer approach offers a unique opportunity for long-term success.
