In the realm of the internet, a legal battle between Meta, the social media giant, and Bright Data, an Israeli web scraping company, has come to an end. Meta, known for its aggressive stance against data scraping, found itself on the losing side of a key claim in the case, leading to the withdrawal of the lawsuit.

The crux of the matter revolved around the collection of user data by Bright Data, a practice Meta vehemently opposed. However, the court ruled in favor of Bright Data, stating that Meta failed to provide sufficient evidence that the company had scraped anything beyond publicly available information.

The case highlighted the extent to which third-party firms like Bright Data gather user data and sell it to other companies for various purposes, including market research, marketing, and AI training. In this instance, Meta presented an example of Bright Data's activities, a massive dataset of Instagram data sold for a substantial sum. However, the court found Meta's evidence insufficient to prove that the data could only have been obtained through a logged-in user account.

Meta's attempts to demonstrate Bright Data's possession of non-public information were also dismissed by the court, as the information could have been publicly accessible at the time of scraping. Additionally, the court disagreed with Meta's argument that using automated tools to bypass access restrictions constituted accessing a ""password-protected website.""

The ruling emphasized the need for Meta to provide stronger evidence of illegal scraping when taking a web scraper to court, beyond merely showing that the company possesses Meta's data and offers data scraping services.

Bright Data, on the other hand, maintained its stance that Meta's terms do not apply to the scraping of public information while logged out of an account and that the case upholds its right to do so.

This outcome serves as a significant victory for Bright Data and the web scraping community, reinforcing the principle that publicly available information remains just that â€“ public.

Meta's withdrawal of the lawsuit marks a rare defeat in its ongoing battle against web scrapers, a practice it has consistently challenged to discourage. Despite this setback, Meta continues to pursue legal action against other companies engaged in similar activities, underscoring its determination to protect its data and user privacy.

The case serves as a reminder of the ongoing debate surrounding data collection and privacy in the digital age, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that respects both the rights of companies to protect their data and the public's right to access information freely available on the internet.

OnePlus Watch 2: Bridging the Gap Between Smarts and Battery Life

In the realm of smartwatches, the choices have been stark: opt for a Wear OS or Apple Watch for smart features and app support, but sacrifice battery life; or choose an RTOS-running smartwatch or Garmin for exceptional battery life, but miss out on the ""smarts.""

The OnePlus Watch 2 boldly steps in to bridge this divide, introducing a revolutionary ""Dual-Engine Architecture"" that seamlessly integrates the smarts of Wear OS with the extended battery life of RTOS. This ingenious design features two chipsets: the Snapdragon W5 performance SoC running Wear OS 4 and the BES 2700 efficiency chipset powering RTOS.

No longer do you have to compromise between hardware, battery life, and smart features. The OnePlus Watch 2 empowers you to enjoy the best of both worlds.

Unparalleled Battery Life: A Game-Changer

As a smartwatch user, I've often found myself yearning for extended battery life. The constant need to charge my watch daily was a major inconvenience. The OnePlus Watch 2 has been a refreshing change, offering me the freedom to go two nights and three days on a single charge, even with sleep tracking and Always on Display (AOD) enabled for eight hours daily.

With AOD turned off, you can easily stretch the battery life to three nights of sleep tracking and four days of daily use. And when you do need to charge, the OnePlus Watch 2 rapidly powers up from 10% to 100% in just 60 minutes.

Seamless Transition Between Smart and Power Saving Modes

The OnePlus Watch 2 seamlessly transitions between Smart mode (Wear OS) and Power Saving mode (RTOS) in just three to five seconds. This allows you to effortlessly switch between the full-fledged Wear OS experience and the extended battery life of RTOS, depending on your needs.

In Power Saving mode, you can still receive notifications, track fitness and sleep data, and access sports modes for activities like swimming, cycling, and badminton. The tracked data remains safe and accessible when you switch back to Smart mode.

Innovative Charging Solution: Simplicity at its Finest

One of the most frustrating aspects of owning a smartwatch is the additional charging cable it requires. The OnePlus Watch 2 elegantly solves this issue with a magnetic charging puck that supports a removable Type-C cable. This means you can conveniently charge your watch using the same cable as your phone, eliminating the need for multiple chargers.

Accuracy and Features: A Mixed Bag

The OnePlus Watch 2 delivers accurate sleep tracking data, comparable to the metrics provided by the RingConn Smart Ring. However, it could benefit from improved workout tracking, as it sometimes fails to prompt workout triggers during outdoor walks.

The watch boasts Dual Frequency GPS for precise outdoor running tracking, offering suggestions to optimize movement behaviors. Additionally, it features IP68 and 5 ATM certification, making it suitable for swimming.

OHealth App: Room for Improvement

The OnePlus Watch 2 connects to Android phones via the OHealth app. The setup is straightforward, but the app's functionality needs refinement. For instance, while it displays a graph of workout time, it lacks details about the specific workouts performed.

Design and Comfort: A Matter of Taste

The OnePlus Watch 2 sports a large 47mm case, which may not suit everyone's preferences. While I personally enjoy big watches, I recognize that it might be too large for individuals with smaller wrists. The watch's unconventional right edge design adds a unique personality, but the lack of scrolling support on the crown-shaped button is a missed opportunity.

Despite its size, the OnePlus Watch 2 is surprisingly comfortable to wear. I experienced no discomfort during my week of use.

OnePlus Watch 2: A Solid Choice for Smartwatch Enthusiasts

Priced at $299.99 / 24,999 Indian Rupees, the OnePlus Watch 2 is an excellent choice for those seeking a smartwatch that offers both smart features and extended battery life. Its innovative Dual-Engine Architecture, brilliant battery life, and convenient charging solution make it a standout in the smartwatch market.

While it has room for improvement in terms of workout tracking and app functionality, the OnePlus Watch 2 delivers an impressive overall experience. Its classy design, bright display, responsive UI, and comfortable form factor make it a compelling option for those who value both style and functionality.
