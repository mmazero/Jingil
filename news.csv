https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/jolla-mind2/,Mobile OS maker Jolla is back and building an AI device,"

In the realm of mobile innovation, a new player has emerged, promising to revolutionize the way we interact with AI. Jolla, a resurgent startup, is introducing a groundbreaking device that aims to provide users with a secure and private AI experience.

This innovative device is envisioned as a personal cloud and AI router, granting users access to their data for running AI queries. It's a modern take on the personal server concept, reimagined for the era of generative AI.

At the heart of this device lies a focus on privacy and security. The processing of assistive data takes place entirely on the device, eliminating the need for third-party involvement and safeguarding user information.

Jolla's mission is to empower individuals with the benefits of advanced AI without compromising their privacy. The device serves as a secure hub, housing all personal information and allowing users to tap into the power of AI without exposing their data to data-hungry corporations.

The device's capabilities extend beyond basic AI functions. It can intelligently respond to natural language queries, proactively surface insights, and draw upon trusted access to the user's mobile data and digital services.

Jolla's approach is rooted in open-source AI large language models, such as Meta's LLaMA 2, forming the foundation for its generative AI capabilities. The team focuses on designing the user interface and function, leveraging the power of open-source general-purpose AIs.

The device's significance lies in its ability to address the growing concerns surrounding data concentration and the potential risks associated with exporting personal information. It offers a safe and secure alternative, allowing users to maintain control over their data.

The level of data protection provided by the device depends on the user's willingness to route AI processing through it. By practicing good privacy hygiene, users can minimize their privacy risks when utilizing generative AI.

Jolla's vision extends beyond individual users, aiming to establish a platform that attracts developers to build apps that operate within its protective layer of privacy and security. This would transform the device into a hub for AI innovation, fostering a community of developers focused on AI advancements.

The device's impact on mobile apps is predicted to be profound. Generative AI interfaces may gradually replace traditional mobile apps, pushing them into the background. Jolla's expertise in operating system development positions it to capitalize on this shift.

The prototype, aptly named Jolla Mind², embodies the concept of AI as a 'second brain' for humans, providing adaptive digital assistance. Its target audience is primarily Android smartphone users, offering them a secure gateway to advanced AI without compromising their privacy.

Jolla's determination to challenge the dominance of Big Tech in the AI landscape is evident in their belief that generative AI should not be monopolized by a few large companies. They aim to create an open and accessible platform that fosters innovation and empowers individuals.

A glimpse of the Jolla Mind² prototype reveals a mobile phone interface seamlessly interacting with AI systems and databases running on the prototype hardware. The AI assistant responds to natural language queries with contextually relevant answers, demonstrating its capabilities in email triage, smart minutes, and more.

The final form factor, features, and specifications of the device are yet to be finalized. However, Jolla's vision is clear: to create a static device that serves as a secure hub for personal data, accessible remotely through the user's mobile device.

Jolla's journey has been marked by challenges and triumphs. After a decade of perseverance, the company achieved profitability in 2021, only to face adversity with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Through litigation and a court-adjudicated restructuring process, the team regained control of the company's assets, paving the way for a fresh start.

The official announcement of Jolla's first AI product is set for May 20, 2023, marking a decade since the company's initial announcement of its first mobile phone. Pre-ordering is expected to commence at this time, with shipping anticipated in Q4 2023.

Jolla's mission to democratize AI and empower individuals with secure and private AI experiences is a bold step towards a future where technology serves humanity without compromising fundamental rights. The Jolla Mind² device has the potential to redefine the way we interact with AI, ushering in a new era of responsible and ethical AI innovation.

In a recent development, Sony's PlayStation division is facing a significant restructuring, resulting in the unfortunate layoff of approximately 900 employees. This move affects 8% of the division's global workforce, joining a growing list of companies announcing major cuts in recent times. Additionally, Sony's London Studio in the U.K. will be closed as part of this restructuring.

PlayStation chief Jim Ryan addressed employees in a note, explaining that after careful consideration and extensive discussions, it became evident that changes were necessary to ensure the company's long-term growth and sustainability. The goal is to deliver the best possible experiences for the PlayStation community.

In a separate post, head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst revealed that the layoffs will impact renowned studios such as Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite. This decision affects employees across the Americas, Japan, EMEA, and APAC regions. Some ongoing projects in various stages of development will be discontinued as a result.

This news comes shortly after Sony revised its sales forecast for the PlayStation 5, citing a decline in demand. The company now expects to sell 21 million units in its fiscal year, down from the previous estimate of 25 million. Sony shares experienced a downturn following this announcement.

It's worth noting that Sony is not alone in facing these challenges. The gaming industry has witnessed several recent job cuts. Microsoft, for instance, let go of 1,900 employees from Activision Blizzard and Xbox, while Unity laid off 25% of its workforce. Numerous other companies, including tech giants like Google, Snapchat, eBay, PayPal, and Discord, have also conducted sizable layoffs in the past month.

In the realm of finance, time is a precious commodity, and any tool that streamlines financial processes is sure to garner attention. Enter Embat, a Spanish fintech company that has secured $16 million in Series AS funding to revolutionize real-time treasury management.

Embat's mission is to digitize and automate financial processes, saving time and increasing efficiency for finance teams. Their solution automates accounting and bank reconciliation, centralizes collections, payments, and treasury processes, and even employs AI to reduce errors.

With an impressive client roster that includes Playtomic, Cabify, Wallapop, and Fever, Embat has established a strong foothold in Europe. Their partnership with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform further enhances their ability to deliver accurate and reliable financial insights.

While Embat faces competition from established players like Kyriba and Sage XRT, they differentiate themselves through their focus on APIs and automated cash accounting. This approach enables global connectivity and significant cost savings for clients.

Embat's co-founder, Antonio Berga, remains tight-lipped about specific competitors but emphasizes their commitment to innovation. Their focus on APIs and automated cash accounting sets them apart, allowing them to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for finance teams.

As Embat continues to expand its reach and refine its platform, the future of real-time treasury management looks promising. Their dedication to streamlining financial processes and leveraging AI positions them as a formidable player in the fintech landscape.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/writers-latest-models-can-generate-text-from-images-including-charts-and-graphs/,Writer's latest models can generate text from images including charts and graphs,"

In the realm of generative AI, Writer, a San Francisco-based startup, stands out with its focus on creating practical business applications. Their latest innovation, Palmyra-Vision, adds a new dimension to their text generation capabilities by extracting insights from images, including graphs and charts.

May Habib, Writer's co-founder and CEO, explains their strategic decision to concentrate on multimodal content, emphasizing text output. This approach involves analyzing images to generate text, rather than producing images from data. Palmyra-Vision employs multiple models, each with a specific role in interpreting the image and generating accurate text descriptions.

Palmyra-Vision opens up a world of possibilities for businesses. Imagine an eCommerce website that can automatically generate product descriptions from thousands of changing images, keeping up with the latest merchandise without manual intervention. Or consider a pharmaceutical company using Palmyra-Vision to ensure that ad copy complies with FDA regulations, comparing it against associated documents.

Another intriguing application is the interpretation and summarization of handwritten notes into text. However, Habib emphasizes the need for training the model for specific use cases, such as medical or insurance, to ensure accuracy.

Habib stresses the importance of human review as part of the workflow, as models can sometimes hallucinate or make mistakes. While this is currently recommended to customers, she envisions a more automated workflow in the future.

Writer has secured $126 million in funding to date and is in talks with major cloud infrastructure platforms for potential partnerships. Their latest funding round was a $100 million Series B led by Iconiq last September.

Palmyra-Vision, with its image-to-text capabilities, is now available, offering businesses a powerful tool to unlock insights from visual data.

Lapse has captured the imagination of millions of users, amassing a staggering 100 million photos captured each month and securing a coveted spot among the top 10 photographic apps in the U.S. app store. This remarkable success has attracted a new round of funding worth $30 million, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, alongside previous backers GV, Octopus Ventures, and Speedinvest.

Unveiling the Secrets Behind Lapse's Alluring Simplicity

Lapse's allure lies not only in its nostalgic appeal but also in its innovative approach to photo processing. Each captured image undergoes a meticulous 12-step process, employing computer vision and proprietary algorithms to optimize the composition, colors, and overall aesthetics of the photo. This behind-the-scenes magic ensures that your shots look their best, without the need for manual editing or filters.

Addressing Growth Challenges and Navigating Ethical Dilemmas

Lapse's rapid ascent has not been without its challenges. The app initially employed growth-hacking techniques, including forced invites, to expand its user base. While this strategy helped Lapse reach the top of the app stores, it raised concerns about sustainability and user experience.

In response to these criticisms, Lapse has shifted its focus towards organic growth, relying on word-of-mouth and the app's inherent appeal to attract new users. The company now boasts a critical mass of users, eliminating the need for forced invites. However, some users still find the app's onboarding process confusing, highlighting the delicate balance between user acquisition and ethical practices.

A Glimpse into the Future of Lapse: Monetization and Video Horizons

While Lapse has yet to explore monetization, CEO Dan Silvertown hints at potential avenues that deviate from the traditional advertising model. The company aims to maintain its user-centric approach, prioritizing the user experience over revenue generation.

In addition to refining its photo-sharing features, Lapse is also venturing into the realm of video, recognizing the growing popularity of this medium. The company envisions a future where users can capture and share short, unedited video clips, further expanding the creative possibilities within the app.

A New Era of Social Media: Simplicity, Authenticity, and Connection

In a world saturated with curated feeds and endless scrolling, Lapse offers a refreshing alternative, encouraging users to connect with friends and family through unedited, spontaneous moments.

As the social media landscape evolves, Lapse stands poised to capitalize on this shift towards authenticity and genuine connection. With its unique blend of nostalgia, innovation, and user-centric design, Lapse is well-positioned to become a leading player in the next generation of social media.

Rethinking Construction: A New Venture Capital Firm Takes Center Stage

In the realm of industries, construction has often been seen as a laggard in adopting technology. However, a groundbreaking venture capital firm, Zacua Ventures, is poised to change this narrative. With the backing of 19 construction industry giants, including Procore, Volvo, and Cemex, Zacua Ventures has launched its inaugural $56 million fund to empower early-stage construction technology startups.

Zacua Ventures, founded in 2022 by Vivin Hegde, Mauricio Tessi Weiss, and Juan Nieto, aims to address the fragmented technology adoption in the construction sector, which is predominantly composed of small and medium-sized companies. The firm seeks startups that can provide innovative solutions to streamline processes, enhance productivity, and promote sustainability.

The construction industry's digital transformation is gaining momentum, with startups emerging to tackle various challenges. From PermitFlow's mission to simplify construction permitting to Buildstock's focus on resolving late payments in the industry, the sector is witnessing a surge of innovation.

Zacua Ventures recognizes the immense potential of construction technology, given that the industry accounts for a significant portion of global GDP and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The firm's investment strategy targets startups that address sustainability, productivity, and urbanization.

The venture capital firm's partners, with a regional presence in Spain, Mexico, and Singapore, seek startups that enhance efficiency, reduce carbon footprints, and contribute to the development of resilient structures. Zacua Ventures has already invested in several promising startups, including Construex, a software-as-a-service marketplace for the construction and design industries, and Flexnode, a data infrastructure startup.

Zacua Ventures' successful launch of its $56 million fund in a challenging economic climate underscores the immense opportunity in the construction technology sector. The firm's focus on specific industry pain points and its commitment to sustainability and innovation position it as a key player in driving the construction industry's digital transformation.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/asymmetrical-financial-is-betting-big-on-the-bitcoin-defi-space-with-new-dedicated-fund/,Asymmetric Financial has a plan to unlock Bitcoin's trillion-dollar potential with dedicated DeFi fund,"

In the realm of digital assets, a resurgence is underway, and crypto funds are seizing the opportunity to delve into specific sectors. One such fund, Asymmetric Financial, is launching its Bitcoin DeFi Venture Fund I, aiming to invest in the burgeoning DeFi space within the Bitcoin blockchain.

Led by Dan Held, a seasoned Bitcoiner and former growth director at Kraken, the fund targets a $21 million raise. DeFi, short for decentralized finance, harnesses blockchain technology to facilitate direct transactions between market players and retail investors, eliminating the need for intermediaries. DeFi applications include decentralized lending and borrowing platforms, enabling individuals to access capital without traditional credit checks.

Held, alongside the firm's CEO and CIO Joe McCann, seeks to make contrarian bets in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Held's long-standing advocacy for DeFi in Bitcoin and his involvement in Ordinals-focused Taproot Wizards and Bitcoin application-focused Trust Machines underscore his commitment to this sector.

The scarcity of crypto venture capital firms investing in Bitcoin-centric startups is a notable gap in the market. Many VCs dismiss Bitcoin as an investment opportunity, while others view DeFi as speculative and Bitcoin itself as outdated. However, Held believes both perspectives are misguided.

He foresees a surge in investment in layer-2 (L2) blockchains, which offer enhanced speed and throughput compared to layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin. Additionally, he sees potential in meta-protocols, encompassing NFT-like Ordinals and similar actions. While much of this activity has centered around Ethereum, Held believes Bitcoin's blockchain holds immense potential as an ecosystem.

Held emphasizes the significance of building on the most popular chain in terms of users, volume, liquidity, and value. Bitcoin's trillion-dollar asset value and untapped potential in DeFi and collateral make it a compelling choice for investment and development.

Despite its infancy, the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem has witnessed notable trading volumes, sometimes surpassing Ethereum. Held sees this as an area worth monitoring closely.

Held is not alone in his bullish outlook for building on Bitcoin. Market players anticipate substantial funding rounds for L2 chains scaling Bitcoin, indicating growing interest in this sector. However, Held acknowledges the challenges of developing on Bitcoin due to its early-stage L2 infrastructure and limited developer focus.

The fund's investment strategy involves primarily token deals, with some consideration for equity. Beyond financial support, Held aims to leverage his expertise as a Bitcoin marketer and operator to assist projects with brand positioning, customer acquisition, and market expansion.

Held predicts the next ""DeFi summer,"" a period of explosive growth in the DeFi space, to occur on Bitcoin in 2025 or potentially sooner if infrastructure development accelerates. He envisions a Bitcoin DeFi renaissance, unlocking the immense value of Bitcoin and creating the most significant opportunity in the crypto realm.

Securing Funding and Identifying Target Markets

Displace is seeking a modest Series A funding round of $5 million to fuel its ambitious growth plans. The company has garnered significant interest from diverse sectors, including art studios, museums, and even embassies. Businesses seeking innovative display solutions, particularly those requiring wall or window mounting, have shown keen interest in Displace's technology.

Unveiling the Mechanics: How Does Displace Work?

Displace TVs employ a unique vacuum suction system, allowing them to adhere to various surfaces, including drywall. Swappable batteries power the screens, eliminating the need for unsightly cables. Content is streamed wirelessly from a base station, similar to LG's OLED M.

Adhesion, Safety, and Longevity

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/moneyhash-raises-4-5m-for-its-payment-orchestration-platform-serving-merchants-in-mena/,MoneyHash raises $4.5M for its payment orchestration platform serving merchants in MENA,"

In the Middle East and Africa (MEA), the payment landscape is fragmented, with diverse payment methods, evolving regulations, and varied customer preferences. This complexity is compounded by challenges like payment fraud, low checkout conversion rates, and high transaction failures.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital payments in the region, but infrastructure remains inadequate. Payment failures are three times higher than the global average, and fraud rates and cart abandonment exceed other regions by over 20%.

Payment orchestration platforms like MoneyHash streamline payment processes for merchants through unified APIs. MoneyHash, an Egyptian fintech, recently raised $4.5 million in seed investment to invest in technology and growth across the region.

Navigating this burgeoning payments market requires patience and continuous learning. Merchants often start with one or two payment processors but face challenges integrating different payment stacks as they expand. MoneyHash's product includes a unified API, customizable checkout, transaction routing, and reporting.

MoneyHash's CEO, Nader Abdelrazik, shared insights from collaborating with merchants. Payment failure rates vary significantly across the region, and relying on averages can be misleading. Some businesses may have low failure rates, while others may have high rates, excluding customers who abandon checkout voluntarily.

Most merchants are unaware of the complexity of payments and the fixable leakages they have. Merchants are also expanding faster than their partner payment service providers (PSPs), leading to slower rollout of new products and customizations. MoneyHash collaborates with PSPs that cater to enterprises and prioritize customer requirements.

MoneyHash's team expertise is key, and they hire exclusively with payments and tech backgrounds, even in non-technical positions. Following a Beta launch in 2022, MoneyHash introduced its enterprise suite last October, targeting large enterprises.

Unveiling the Enigma: Destiny 2's Final Shape Pre-Orders and Beyond

In the vast cosmos of Destiny 2, a new chapter awaits, shrouded in mystery and anticipation. The Final Shape, the upcoming expansion, has sparked a flurry of speculation among its dedicated community. However, a recent analysis by Zuhaad Ali of Destiny Bulletin has cast a shadow of doubt over the expansion's pre-order numbers, claiming they fall short compared to previous releases.

Ali's methodology revolves around examining data from Charlemagnebot, a playerbase data-hoarding tool, to gauge the number of players who possess the emblem associated with Final Shape pre-orders. The findings reveal that those with the emblem currently constitute less than a quarter of Lightfall's pre-orders and a mere 13% of Beyond Light's, which reportedly holds the record for the highest pre-order count.

This disparity has painted a bleak picture, suggesting that Bungie's most pivotal expansion faces an uphill battle in terms of pre-orders. However, several factors cast doubt on the accuracy of this assessment.

Firstly, Charlemagnebot only monitors a fraction of the Destiny 2 player base, limiting the representativeness of its data. Additionally, the method of obtaining the pre-order emblem has changed, requiring players to claim it from the Rewards kiosk rather than Rahool. This alteration may have affected the visibility of the emblem in collections, potentially skewing the data.

Moreover, Bungie's track record indicates that pre-orders often surge closer to the expansion's launch. Players who intend to purchase the expansion may delay their pre-order until they receive more information or incentives.

While the emblem-based analysis raises concerns, other factors also contribute to the perceived lower pre-order numbers for The Final Shape. Bungie's recent layoffs and reports of revenue shortfalls, coupled with the underwhelming reception of Lightfall, may have dampened enthusiasm among some players.

Furthermore, the live service gaming landscape has become increasingly competitive, with new titles vying for players' attention. As Destiny 2 continues to age, it faces natural declines in player engagement, further impacting pre-order numbers.

Despite these challenges, it's essential to acknowledge the potential caveats and unknowns surrounding the pre-order data. The emblem-based analysis, while intriguing, should not be taken as an absolute measure of The Final Shape's success.

Ultimately, the true fate of Destiny 2's final Light and Darkness expansion remains uncertain. Only time will tell if it can overcome the obstacles and deliver an experience that captivates the hearts of its loyal guardians.

Understanding the Enigma of Kleptomania: Why Do People Steal Things They Don't Need?

In the realm of mental health disorders, kleptomania stands out as a perplexing condition characterized by an irresistible urge to steal items that hold little practical or monetary value. This puzzling behavior often leaves people questioning the motives behind such acts, especially when the consequences can be severe.

Unveiling the Impulsive Nature of Kleptomania

At the core of kleptomania lies a lack of impulse control. Individuals with this condition struggle to resist the sudden, unplanned urge to steal, often acting without considering the potential repercussions. This impulsive behavior is often accompanied by a sense of tension or anxiety before the act and a temporary feeling of relief or gratification afterward, despite the absence of any practical benefit.

The Link Between Depression and Kleptomania

Research has revealed a strong correlation between kleptomania and mood disorders, particularly major depressive disorder. For some individuals, stealing becomes a maladaptive coping mechanism to deal with overwhelming feelings of depression, guilt, and shame. The act of stealing may provide a fleeting sense of relief or distraction from their emotional turmoil.

Seeking Solace in the Face of Stress

For many kleptomaniacs, stealing serves as a way to cope with negative emotions and underlying psychological stress. The act of stealing may offer temporary respite from emotional discomfort or distract them from problems in other areas of their lives. This misguided coping mechanism can lead to a cycle of stealing to escape emotional pain, further exacerbating the problem.

Breaking the Cycle: Seeking Support and Treatment

Kleptomania, like any other mental health condition, requires empathy, attention, and compassion. It is crucial to recognize kleptomania as a legitimate disorder rather than a moral failing or character flaw. With the right support and treatment, individuals with kleptomania can overcome the challenges associated with their condition and lead fulfilling lives.

Seeking Professional Help

If you or someone you know is struggling with kleptomania, seeking professional help is essential. A combination of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology can be highly beneficial in treating the disorder. Psychotherapy can help individuals develop healthier coping mechanisms, address underlying emotional issues, and reduce the urge to steal. Psychopharmacology, on the other hand, can help manage symptoms and improve overall mental well-being.

Overcoming the Stigma

The stigma surrounding kleptomania can be a significant barrier to seeking support. Many individuals may feel ashamed, embarrassed, or afraid to seek help due to fear of judgment or condemnation. It is important to remember that kleptomania is a mental health condition, and individuals deserve empathy, compassion, and understanding.

Conclusion

Kleptomania is a complex disorder that requires professional intervention and support. By understanding the underlying factors that drive this condition, we can help individuals break free from the cycle of stealing and lead fulfilling lives.
