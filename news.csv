Instagram is reportedly working on a new feature called Blend. This unique feature, as discovered by TechCrunch, would create a private collection of Reels, exclusively accessible to you and a friend. Blend will consist of Reels that you've shared with others and those that you both have shown interest in, forming a personalized feed shared between the two of you. Either user can choose to leave the Blend at any time.

For now, Blend remains an internal prototype and is not being tested externally. Instagram confirmed this information to TechCrunch, so users will have to wait a bit longer before they can access this feature.

For those new to Instagram, Reels are short, entertaining videos that users can record and post with an audio track and special effects. With a private account, you can share your Reels with your followers or close friends. Public accounts allow for sharing Reels with anyone on Instagram. To view a Reel, simply tap the Reels icon in the mobile app or on the website.

Instagram uses various strategies to recommend Reels that align with user preferences. These include suggesting Reels liked by someone you follow, Reels you've already watched, posts you've liked or saved, and resharing or watching Reels in their entirety.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/terraform-industries-converted-electricity-and-air-into-synthetic-natural-gas/,Terraform Industries converts electricity and air into synthetic natural gas for the first time," ""Terraform Industries produces synthetic natural gas for the first time"" ","The modern world is heavily reliant on a vast network for extracting, processing, transporting, and consuming hydrocarbons like crude oil and natural gas. However, these resources come with a cost: they are finite, difficult to extract, and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Instead of reducing humanity's dependence on hydrocarbons, Terraform Industries' solution is to produce this resource using electricity and air through a system called the Terraformer. The startup has recently announced that it has commissioned a demonstrator Terraformer and produced synthetic natural gas for the first time.

The Terraformer is roughly the size of two shipping containers and consists of three subsystems: an electrolyzer, a direct air capture system, and a chemical reactor. The electrolyzer converts solar power into hydrogen, the direct air capture system captures CO2, and the chemical reactor ingests both inputs to produce pipeline-grade synthetic natural gas. The entire machine is optimized for a one-megawatt solar array.

Terraform's process is not ""super original,"" but the company has been able to innovate on the process, including building its proprietary direct air capture system and adapting all of it to work with a variable energy source, solar power. The result is significant cost reductions: Terraform's system converts clean electricity into hydrogen at less than $2.50 per kilogram of H2 (currently, green hydrogen ranges from $5-11 per kilogram, Handmer estimated). The direct air capture system also filters CO2 for less than $250 per ton, a world record.

The startup plans to bring these prices down even further to ensure that its synthetic natural gas hits cost parity with conventionally sourced liquified natural gas. This will require the build-out of lots of cheap solar power and the production of thousands of Terraformers per year. However, CEO Casey Handmer is keenly aware that Terraform's plans will fail without a strong business case.

Handmer believes that Terraform's technology is a critical step towards a more sustainable future, but it is not a panacea. He understands that the world's energy systems are complex and interconnected, and that any solution will require collaboration and innovation across multiple sectors. Nonetheless, Terraform's technology has the potential to transform the way we produce and consume energy, and Handmer is optimistic about the future.

In conclusion, Terraform Industries' Terraformer is a game-changing technology that could revolutionize the way we produce and consume energy. While the technology is not ""super original,"" the company's innovations on the process have resulted in significant cost reductions, and the startup is optimistic about the future. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change, technologies like the Terraformer could be critical to a more sustainable future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reactor-and-Gas-Injection-System.jpg?resize=1200,772",2024-04-01 17:05:04,"Join the energy revolution!

Introduction

April Fool's Day in 2004 witnessed an unexpected revelation from tech giant Google – the launch of Gmail. Known for their playful pranks, Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose this day to introduce a groundbreaking innovation in the world of webmail. This article delves into the fascinating tale behind Gmail's debut, highlighting the features that revolutionized electronic communication.

A Prank Too Good To Be True

Larry Page and Sergey Brin, fond of practical jokes, started releasing extravagant concepts each April Fool's Day early in Google's existence. Among these pranks included posting a lunar research facility job listing and announcing a ""scratch and sniff"" function for their search engine. However, when they introduced Gmail with its astounding features, skepticism abounded due to its seemingly impossible capabilities.

Storage Capacity Like Never Before

Gmail entered the scene offering an incredible 1GB of storage per user, leaving competitors far behind. At that time, popular webmail providers such as Yahoo and Microsoft provided only 30 to 60MB of storage. Consequently, Gmail allowed up to 13,500 emails without filling up, contrasted with merely 30 to 60 messages through competing services. Moreover, Gmail integrated Google's powerful search tool, enabling easy retrieval of archived emails and attachments.

Organizing Emails Through Threading

Unlike conventional webmails, Gmail organized related conversations using automatic threading, creating seamless discussions on a particular subject. These innovative features led former Google executive Marissa Mayer, responsible for designing Gmail alongside others, to describe the platform based on three S's: Storage, Search, and Speed.

From Joke to Reality

Shortly after The Associated Press released an exclusive report regarding Gmail's release on April Fool's Day, several readers contacted the news agency claiming it fell prey to yet another Google prank. Nonetheless, reporters confirmed the authenticity of the new service upon visiting Google's headquarters, resulting in extensive media coverage heralding the arrival of Gmail.

Revolutionary Development Process

Dubbed ""Project Caribou,"" named after a recurring joke in the Dilbert comic series, Gmail required three years of development work by a team including Paul Buchheit, Google's 23rd hire. Despite initial doubts surrounding the feasibility of such a vast undertaking, Gmail transformed online communication, eventually amassing approximately 1.8 billion active accounts today.

Conclusion

On April Fool's Day two decades ago, Google launched Gmail, forever changing our expectations of webmail services. With impressive storage capacities, advanced search functionality, and ingenious organization methods, Gmail established itself as a formidable player among existing platforms. As evidenced by its staggering number of active users, Gmail continues to serve millions daily, underscoring the remarkable impact this once-unbelievable prank has left on modern communication.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/gmail-revolutionized-e.jpg,2024-03-31 06:31:14,"Discover the remarkable story behind Gmail's launch on April Fool's Day - how a prank turned into a reality, changing email communication forever!

Introduction

Brace yourself, folks! LinkedIn, the renowned platform for professional networking and career advancement, has jumped onto the short-form video bandwagon. Following the lead of popular platforms such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Facebook, and Instagram Reels, LinkedIn appears to be testing its own version of brief videos. This article delves into the details surrounding this exciting addition and explores how it might impact the future of the platform.

The Emergence of Short Videos on LinkedIn

First discovered by user Austin Null, LinkedIn's latest experiment revolves around short-form videos—snappy clips designed for quick consumption and seamless scrolling. Although uploading videos on LinkedIn isn't novel, this recent endeavor emphasizes brevity similar to stories found on competing apps. Confirming the ongoing tests, LinkedIn shared insights with TechCrunch recently.

Revamping Previous Efforts

Before diving headfirst into the world of vertical videos, LinkedIn had previously introduced a ""fun and casual"" ephemeral video feature called Stories. However, after some consideration, the company decided to axe Stories back in August 2021, aiming instead for ""a reimagined video experience that's even richer and more conversational."" Though the exact formulation remains uncertain, one thing is evident: the social media giant intends to reinvent itself in order to better engage its massive community of professionals.

A Glimpse into the New Feature

Even though the feature is currently in its infancy, leaving many details obscured, here's what we've managed to gather thus far:

- Accessibility: Users can find these bite-sized videos under a brand-new 'Video' tab located atop the navigation bar. Once clicked, viewers can react, leave comments, and disseminate their favorite snippets across the platform.
- Navigation: Similar to other social media outlets offering short-form videos, navigating between each clip involves merely swiping left or right (or clicking accordingly).
- Personalization: Unlike rival apps boasting intricate algorithms capable of customizing content based on individual preferences, LinkedIn has remained mum regarding the particular methods they plan to employ while curating feeds for their diverse user base.

When Can We Expect More Information?

As of now, LinkedIn has refrained from issuing an official announcement concerning the potential release date of this much-anticipated feature. Consequently, all we can do is eagerly await further updates and continue speculating about the myriad ways this could reshape our interactions on the platform.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/the-altstore-an-alternative-app-store-coming-to-eu-will-offer-patreon-backed-apps/,"The AltStore, an alternative app store coming to the EU, will offer Patreon-backed apps"," AltStore to Launch in EU, Offering Patreon-Backed Apps ","THE RISE OF ALTERNATIVE APP STORES: A NEW ERA FOR IPHONE APPS

The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) has targeted Apple's tight grip on the App Store ecosystem for iPhone apps, aiming to stimulate competition in the sector. As a result, we are witnessing the emergence of alternative app stores, such as the AltStore, that are eager to challenge the default iPhone App Store.

APPLE'S DMA COMPLIANCE AND ALTSTORE'S CAPITALIZATION

To adhere to the new European law, Apple has introduced APIs and frameworks that enable developers to distribute apps independently of the App Store. AltStore, a third-party app store, swiftly seized this opportunity, and its developer, Riley Testut, recently shared screenshots of the upcoming version of his app store, which will be available in the EU. This new version will support Patreon-backed apps.

A UNIQUE MONETIZATION MODEL FOR ALTSTORE

Unlike traditional app stores, the AltStore will not rely solely on advertisements, paid downloads, or in-app purchases for monetization. Instead, it will allow developers to utilize its custom Patreon integration to market their apps directly to consumers. The store, which already offers sideloading apps like Delta, Testut's video game emulator, will initially launch in the EU with just two apps: Delta (free) and the AltStore's clipboard manager Clip (requiring a $1 or more pledge on Patreon). Beta versions of both Delta and Clip will be available for $3 per month with a Patreon pledge.

AltStore's new monetization model is reminiscent of Apple's in-app subscriptions but without the customary 15% to 30% commission on sales. The EU's DMA rules allow alternative app stores to opt for a €0.50 fee per first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold, a new scheme targeting larger apps' revenue, known as the Core Technology Fee. However, Apple's compliance with this fee remains uncertain, as the EU is investigating the tech giant for non-compliance with competition law.

Astra's Rocket 3.0 suffered a catastrophic end during prelaunch testing in March 2020, as shown in footage obtained by TechCrunch. The explosion, which occurred at Alaska's Pacific Spaceport Complex, was initially reported as an ""anomaly,"" an industry term for any issue that deviates from the expected outcome.

At the time, Astra CEO Chris Kemp told TechCrunch that the rocket ""suffered an anomaly following an otherwise successful day of testing in Kodiak in preparation for a launch this week."" However, the company's hardware was the only thing harmed, and they did not attempt a launch after that week. Meanwhile, Alaska Aerospace CEO Mark Lester told local reporters that the company was executing its emergency checklist and requested everyone to stay clear of the area to allow the crew to address the situation.

The video clip shows the micro launcher bursting into flames, indicating that the vehicle did not survive. It would have been Astra's third orbital launch attempt.

At the time, Astra was taking such failures in stride, with the expectation that every launch would not have to be perfect. Astra CEO Chris Kemp summed it up in a May 2022 interview: ""The expectation I think that a lot of people have is every launch has to be perfect. I think what Astra has to do, really, is we have to have so many launches nobody thinks about it anymore.""

Despite being one of the biggest success stories for space industry investors, with the startup going public in July 2021 at a $2.1 billion valuation after raising nearly $500 million for its ultra-low-cost launch plans, Astra's plans failed to materialize, and after months of burning cash, the company's board quietly accepted a take-private deal from Kemp and CTO Adam London at a stock price of just $0.50 per share. The deal is expected to close sometime this quarter, at which time Astra will cease trading on the Nasdaq.

Astra did not return a request for comment on the 2020 launch failure.
