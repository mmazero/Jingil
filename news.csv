Introduction:

In recent years, Android and iPhone users have been plagued by the “Green bubble-blue bubble” issue, where messages sent between the two platforms are displayed differently. Google has been pushing for years for Apple to add Rich Communication Services (RCS) support to iPhones, which would allow them to send high-res media via the native text messaging app on Android. Today, we have some exciting news: sources are reporting that Apple will roll out RCS support for iPhones this fall.

Body:

Last November, Apple confirmed that it was working on adding support for RCS. At the time, the company didn’t specify a timeline, but said that the compatibility would arrive “next year.” Today, we have learned that the fall of 2024 is the expected date for RCS support on iPhones.

Google has been urging Apple to add RCS for a long time, hoping to reduce the “Green bubble-blue bubble” differentiation. While RCS won’t solve this problem entirely, it will allow Android users to send high-res media to iPhone users via the native text messaging app on Android.

In the meantime, Google has been working on improving RCS features. Last year, the company announced new features such as a profile, Photomoji, and improved audio quality for voice notes. Google reported that 1 billion people were using RCS monthly, indicating that the service is gaining popularity among users.

While the news of RCS support on iPhones is welcome, it comes at a time when Apple is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. The lawsuit alleges that Apple has been engaging in monopolistic practices, including preventing users from sending messages via RCS.

Conclusion:

The addition of RCS support on iPhones is a step in the right direction, as it will allow for a more seamless messaging experience between Android and iPhone users. While the “Green bubble-blue bubble” issue won’t be completely resolved, it will make it easier for users to send high-res media via the native text messaging app. As Google continues to improve RCS features, we can expect to see more users adopt the service. While the lawsuit against Apple may delay the implementation of RCS on iPhones, we hope that it won’t prevent it from happening altogether.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-rcs-campaign.png?resize=1200,726",2024-03-29 06:42:30,"Meta Description: Apple is set to roll out RCS support for iPhones this fall, ending the ""Green bubble-blue bubble"" issue.

Ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison
","

Once a rising star in the crypto world, disgraced ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to 25 years in prison by New York's Southern District Court. The decision was handed down by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who cited the potential for future harm as the reason for the harsh sentence.

In a statement, Bankman-Fried expressed regret for his actions and the people he had hurt. ""It's been excruciating to watch,"" he said, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. However, he also recognized that his actions would likely result in significant time behind bars. ""My useful life is probably over,"" he said. ""It's been over for a while now.""

Judge Kaplan explained that the harsh sentence was necessary to prevent Bankman-Fried from causing harm in the future. ""He's in a position to do something very bad in the future,"" the judge said. The sentence was aimed at disabling him for an extended period, with the goal of protecting society.

Bankman-Fried's defense team had requested a sentence of 5 to 6.5 years, citing his charitable works and commitment to others. However, prosecutors had asked for something much harsher, with a sentence of 40 to 50 years to reflect the seriousness of his crimes. The maximum possible sentence was 110 years.

The case against Bankman-Fried began in December 2022 when he was arrested in the Bahamas. He faced seven charges, including wire fraud against FTX customers and Alameda Research lenders, conspiracy to commit wire fraud against both entities, and conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud on FTX customers and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was found guilty of all charges.

The trial lasted one month, with prosecutors arguing that Bankman-Fried used FTX funds to keep his sibling company Alameda Research afloat. Caroline Ellison, his one-time girlfriend and CEO of Alameda, confirmed this and admitted to committing fraud on behalf of Bankman-Fried. The defense team, on the other hand, tried to portray him as a hapless math nerd who was out of control.

Alameda borrowed over $8 billion from FTX, money that was taken from the accounts of FTX customers. Bankman-Fried claims he only learned of this in 2020 and did not take any actions to safeguard the funds. He took the stand during the trial and said that he deeply regrets not taking a deeper look into what was happening with both companies. FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in 2022.

""Clearly, I made a lot of mistakes. There are things I would give anything to be able to do over again,"" Bankman-Fried told the New York Times before the trial began.

"," 

Are you tired of having to manually fact-check the results of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT? Well, a team of artificial intelligence specialists at Google's DeepMind has developed an AI-based fact-checking system called SAFE, that can automatically check the accuracy of LLM responses. 

In recent years, LLMs have been making headlines for their ability to write papers, answer questions, and even solve math problems. However, their accuracy has been a major concern, as every result obtained by an LLM must be manually checked to ensure it is correct. This greatly reduces their value. 

To address this issue, the researchers at DeepMind created an AI application called Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE uses an LLM to break down claims or facts in an answer provided by the original LLM and then uses Google Search to find sites that could be used for verification. It then compares the two answers to determine accuracy. 

The team tested their system on approximately 16,000 facts contained in answers given by several LLMs. They compared their results against human (crowdsourced) fact-checkers and found that SAFE matched the findings of the humans 72% of the time. When testing disagreements between SAFE and the human checkers, the researchers found SAFE to be the one that was correct 76% of the time. 

The code for SAFE is now available for anyone to use, and can be found on GitHub. With this tool, you can now trust the results of LLMs without having to manually fact-check them. 

In conclusion, SAFE is an excellent solution to the accuracy issues that have plagued LLMs. It allows you to trust the results of LLMs without having to manually fact-check them, saving you valuable time and effort. So why not try it out today and see how it can improve your workflow?

In today's world, the growing demand for generative AI has brought with it concerns about its safe and reliable deployment. As enterprises look to integrate AI into their operations, they need to ensure that the large language model (LLM) applications they develop deliver outputs of the highest quality without veering into unknown territories.

Enter Microsoft, which has just announced the launch of new Azure AI tools designed to address these concerns. The company's offerings are currently being previewed and are expected to become broadly available in the coming months.

Prompt Injection Attacks and Microsoft's Solution

One of the most significant challenges associated with LLMs is the problem of prompt injection attacks. These attacks occur when an attacker changes the input prompt of the model in such a way as to bypass the model's normal operations, including safety controls, and manipulate it to reveal personal or harmful content, compromising security or privacy.

To address this problem, Microsoft has introduced Prompt Shields to Azure AI. This comprehensive capability uses advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms and natural language processing to automatically analyze prompts and third-party data for malicious intent and block them from reaching the model.

Prompt Shields will integrate with three AI offerings from Microsoft: Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Content Safety, and Azure AI Studio. It will also include a new feature called ""Groundedness Detection,"" which uses a fine-tuned, custom language model to detect hallucinations or inaccurate material in text outputs produced by the model.

Focus on Reliability and Stress Testing

In addition to addressing prompt injection attacks, Microsoft has introduced tooling to focus on the reliability of gen AI apps. This includes prebuilt templates for safety-centric system messages and a new feature called ""Groundedness Detection.""

The former allows developers to build system messages that guide the model's behavior toward safe, responsible, and data-grounded outputs. The latter uses a fine-tuned, custom language model to detect hallucinations or inaccurate material in text outputs produced by the model.

Both features will be coming to Azure AI Studio and the Azure OpenAI Service. Furthermore, Microsoft has introduced automated evaluations to stress test the gen AI app for risk and safety. These evalu",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-captivating-view-of-a-cutting-edge-futuristic-sh-OxPtPOPFQM6k1RFVYzGxHw-yyrZpNNLTX6bixvkDckurQ-.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-28 16:57:50,"Title: Ensuring Reliability and Safety of AI Applications with Microsoft's New Azure AI Tools

We will delve into the advantages of AI for security teams. Request an invite now.

Transformers have dominated the generative AI landscape since their introduction in 2017, but AI21 Labs' new approach, Jamba, offers a unique solution. Jamba combines the Mamba model, which is based on the Structured State Space model (SSM), along with a transformer architecture to create an optimized gen AI model. Jamba is designed to bring the best attributes of SSM and transformers together. The model is being released as an open-source under the Apache 2.0 license.

While Jamba may not replace current transformer-based large language models (LLM) today, it will likely be a complement in certain areas. Jamba has outperformed traditional transformer-based models on generative reasoning tasks, as measured by benchmarks such as HellaSwag. However, it does not yet outperform transformer-based models on critical benchmarks such as the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) for problem-solving.

AI21 Labs has a particular focus on generative AI for enterprise use cases. The company raised $155 million in August 2023 to support its growing efforts. AI21 Labs' enterprise tools include Wordtune, an optimized service that helps enterprises generate content that matches an organization's tone and brand. The company often competes and wins against AI giant OpenAI for enterprise business.

To date, AI21 Labs' LLM technology has relied on the transformer architecture, just like every other LLM. However, Jamba is different, as it is a hybrid SSM and transformer model. The research team at AI21 Labs has identified several shortcomings with transformers, including slow inference for long context windows and a large memory footprint requirement for scaling transformers. The SSM approach, on the other hand, is designed to handle large context windows and reduce memory usage.

Jamba offers several advantages over traditional transformer-based models. For example, it has a 256K context window and can deliver 3x throughput on long contexts compared to Mixtral 8x7B. Additionally, Jamba uses a Mixture of Exper",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jamba-Cover-Image.png?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-28 19:15:41,"Join us in Atlanta on April 10th and learn about the advantages of AI for security teams.

The 2024 Crypto VC Landscape: A Hot Start to the Year

The first quarter of 2024 has seen a surge in investment in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors, with a total of $2.52 billion raised across both sectors. This represents a 25% increase over the same period in 2023, according to PitchBook data. The cryptocurrency venture capital landscape has been heating up, with deals becoming more active and founders having greater leverage in fundraising.

One reason for this surge in activity is the positive effects of legal wins from Ripple and Grayscale, as well as positive sentiments around decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Solana network. Additionally, demand is increasing for the biggest cryptocurrency post-SEC spot bitcoin ETF approvals in the US. The market has also seen institutional interest start to convert into real budgets and products, such as BlackRock launching a tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain.

In general, the crypto startup deal flow has picked up in areas ranging from DeFi to SocialFi to Bitcoin layer-2 growth. SocialFi, which refers to decentralized social media, is currently very hot, with companies like Bi.social and Mask Network hitting significant fundraising milestones. Web3 gaming is also rapidly expanding, with hundreds of new games expected to go to market later this year. Crypto and AI, blockchains, and anything zero-knowledge related are also ""red-hot right now,"" according to Tom Schmidt, a partner at Dragonfly Capital.

Despite a significant year-over-year decrease in both VC and crypto funding in 2023, around 65%, there is a noticeable uptick in deal-making activity. This is due to a combination of factors, including the positive effects of legal wins, institutional interest, and the macro validation from crypto.

The crypto venture capital landscape has become more competitive, with founders having greater leverage in fundraising. This has created an environment in which investors are now reverse-pitching their value, meaning that some investors have to show founders why they should choose them. Founders now have optionality and the ability to set terms, with competitive rounds filling out before investors have time for intensive due diligence.

Overall, the first quarter of 2024 has seen a strong start to the year for the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming months. With institutional interest and macro validation from crypto, the crypto venture capital landscape will continue to heat up, providing opportunities for both investors and founders.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-qa-ai-dont.html,Q&A: How to train AI when you don't have enough data, How to train AI with limited data? ,"Artificial intelligence is an impressive technology that can analyze and detect patterns in large amounts of data. However, these machine learning algorithms require extensive training with vast amounts of data to achieve accuracy and effectiveness.

Researchers are constantly exploring new applications for AI, but they often run into scenarios where there isn't enough data to accurately train their algorithms. One such example is the analysis of X-ray images to detect rare conditions or the identification of a rare fish species caught on a commercial fishing boat.

Jenq-Neng Hwang, a University of Washington professor of electrical and computer engineering, has expertise in these areas. His team recently developed an algorithm that teaches AI to monitor how many distinct poses a baby can achieve throughout the day. This was a challenging task due to the limited training datasets of babies, which required the team to create a unique pipeline to ensure their algorithm's accuracy and usefulness.

The team presented their work at the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2024, and their research is available on the arXiv preprint server. UW News spoke with Hwang about the project details and other similarly challenging areas the team is addressing.

One example of where AI is particularly well-suited is in tracking baby poses. Hwang and his team collaborated with the UW School of Medicine and the Korean Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute's AI Lab to develop an algorithm to help families with a history of autism identify whether their babies were also likely to have autism.

However, it's challenging to determine if a baby is autistic before they are nine months old, as they don't have language skills at that age. The team developed a test called the Alberta Infant Motor Scale, which categorizes various poses babies can do. If a baby can do a specific pose, they receive points, and the total points are added up to determine if the baby is likely to have autism.

But using a doctor to observe all the different poses is a tedious process that can take several hours. One solution could be to use AI. Parents often have a baby monitor at home, which could use AI to continuously and consistently track the various poses a baby does in a day.

AI is particularly well-suited for this task because it can learn from vast amounts of data, making it an ideal choice for tracking baby poses. The team developed a pipeline that used a large amount of 3D motion sequences of regular people to train a generic 3D pose generative AI model, which was similar to the model used in ChatGPT and other GPT-4 types of large language models.

However, the limited amount of annotated baby motion sequences made it difficult to finetune the model. The team had to develop a unique pipeline that combined the generic model with their small dataset of annotated baby motion sequences. The generic model was able to adapt to the small dataset and produce high-quality results.

In conclusion, AI is an excellent tool for analyzing large amounts of data and detecting patterns or trends. However, these machine learning algorithms require extensive training with vast amounts of data to achieve accuracy and effectiveness. Researchers are constantly exploring new applications for AI, but they often run into scenarios where there isn't enough data to accurately train their algorithms.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/qa-how-to-train-ai-whe.jpg,2024-03-28 16:49:00,"Improve search engine visibility with this Meta Description:

The Tumultuous Times of Byju's: A Test of Resilience and Investor Relations

In the dynamic world of startups, few tales are as compelling as the recent developments at Byju's, the Indian edtech giant once hailed as the country's most valuable startup. The company's founder, Byju Raveendran, finds himself at a critical juncture, navigating through a storm of investor discontent and legal challenges that threaten the very fabric of his enterprise.

The Crux of the Crisis

At the heart of the matter lies a contentious rights issue, a financial maneuver initiated by Byju's in a bid to raise much-needed capital. This move, however, has sparked a fierce backlash from key investors, leading to a standoff that could see their stakes significantly diluted. The rights issue, typically a lifeline for companies, has instead become a battleground, with investors like Prosus Ventures, Peak XV, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative opting out and subsequently engaging in legal action to safeguard their interests.

A Founder's Plea for Unity

In a recent communication to shareholders, Raveendran made an impassioned plea for solidarity, emphasizing his commitment to equality and his vision of collective progress. Despite the adversarial climate, he remains hopeful of securing the necessary support to enact the rights issue, thereby securing Byju's financial future.

The Boardroom Shuffle

The dispute has already seen its share of drama, with high-profile resignations from Byju's board and a notable departure of Deloitte as the company's auditor. These events underscore the governance concerns that have plagued Byju's, further complicating its path to resolution.

A Strategy Under Scrutiny

Byju's ambitious expansion strategy, marked by a flurry of acquisitions during the pandemic, has come under intense scrutiny. The company's aggressive growth plans, once seen as a sign of its bold vision, now appear to some as overreach, particularly in light of the global economic shifts precipitated by geopolitical tensions.

A Founder's Reflection

Raveendran acknowledges the missteps along the way and seeks a chance to recalibrate Byju's trajectory. His personal investment in the company's success is undeniable, and he remains hopeful that his backers will continue to share in the journey, despite the current turbulence.

Looking Ahead

As Byju's braces for the upcoming court date and the final verdict on the rights issue, the tech world watches with bated breath. The outcome of this saga will not only shape the future of Byju's but also serve as a case study in investor relations and crisis management in the startup ecosystem.

This is where the web3 startup Space and Time comes in. Founded by Scott Dykstra, the company aims to provide a verifiable computing layer for web3, allowing for secure and tamper-proof data indexing both on-chain and off-chain.

Dykstra, the CTO and co-founder of the company, highlights the need for data transparency and verification in the wake of the FTX collapse. ""We saw that during the FTX collapse,"" he said on TechCrunch's Chain Reaction podcast. ""We had an organization that had some brand trust, like I had my personal life savings in FTX. I trusted them as a brand.""

This issue transcends beyond FTX, into other industries, where financial institutions have an incentive to manipulate their records. However, Dykstra believes that the solution to this problem lies in verification of data and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs). ZK proofs are cryptographic actions used to prove something about a piece of information without revealing the origin data itself.

At a high level, ZK proofs work by having two parties, the prover and the verifier, that confirm a statement is true without conveying any information more than whether it's correct. For example, if I wanted to know whether someone's credit score was above 700, if there's one in place, a ZK proof can confirm that to the verifier, without actually disclosing the exact number.

Space and Time's ultimate goal is to be that verifiable computing layer for web3, indexing data both off-chain and on-chain. Currently, the startup has indexed from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, Sui, Avalanche, Sei, and Aptos and is adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

However, Dykstra's most recent concern is that AI data isn't really verifiable. ""I'm pretty concerned that we're not really efficiently ever going to be able to verify that an LLM was executed correctly,"" he said.

To solve this issue, teams today are working on building ZK proofs for machine learning or large language models (LLMs), but it can","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1828490321.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 17:00:55,Verify data securely and transparently with ZK proofs for AI.

Introduction:

In today's digital world, social media has become an integral part of our lives. Whether it's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any other platform, the addiction to these networks can be overwhelming. That's where Palmsy comes in. Palmsy is a new app that aims to help individuals who are struggling with social media addiction by providing them with a safe space to post anything they want without the fear of judgment.

Body:

When you sign up to a new social network, you have zero friends, zero followers, and zero likes. But as you start posting content, you might get more and more likes and comments. That could lead to new followers. And that dopamine boost will encourage you to post even more. Palmsy is trying to act as social media methadone by letting you post anything and get likes on them.

The catch is that no one can see the posts. You can publish as many posts as you like, and the app even lets you add photos to your posts. But you're sending those posts into the void. Developer Pat Nakajima said on Threads that no post leaves your device, and all likes are fake.

The free app works on both iPhone and iPad, and it essentially reads your contact list to assign pretend likes to posts. While the app is reading your contact details, because all posts are local, contact information is not sent to a server.

""It can be fun to see Likes coming in from folks you haven't thought about in years,"" Nakajima writes in the FAQ section of the app. ""It can also be useful in maybe deleting some contacts you might not need anymore.""

Beyond looking at contacts, you can treat the app as a personal diary or even a place to get bad puns out of your system - nobody is going to judge you. It's up to you.

The developer recently updated the app with some advanced options that let you limit the number of likes on a particular post and for how long you want those likes to come in: a few seconds, a few minutes, a few hours, or a few days.

There have been multiple time-limiting apps that try to help when it comes to reducing social media addiction. Some developers have also released very basic apps to post dumb","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Palmsy.jpg?resize=1200,589",2024-03-29 11:10:26,"Meta Description:

But even as Uber's ambitions grew, its reputation as a rogue corporate entity only deepened. To this day, it remains one of the most controversial and widely detested companies in the gig economy.

But despite the darkness surrounding Uber's past, it's worth taking a step back and considering the broader implications of the gig economy as a whole. The rise of platform-based work has transformed the traditional notion of self-employment, making it easier than ever for people to earn a living gig by gig. At the same time, this new form of work has also brought with it a host of challenges and risks, from the uncertainty of income to the lack of benefits and protections for workers.

One of the most significant challenges facing gig workers is the ongoing debate over their employment status. While companies like Uber and Lyft insist that their workers are independent contractors, many argue that they should be classified as employees in order to receive benefits and protections such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and workers' compensation. This issue has sparked a number of high-profile legal battles, with gig companies fighting tooth and nail to maintain their current business model.

Another key challenge facing gig workers is the erosion of traditional career paths. As more people turn to gig work as a way to make ends meet, there's a risk that the traditional career ladder will become increasingly irrelevant. This could lead to a more fluid and flexible labor market, with workers able to easily switch between different gigs and industries. But it could also lead to a lack of stability and security for workers, as they struggle to build a long-term career in a world where gig work is the norm.

Despite these challenges, the gig economy has also brought with it a number of benefits. For example, the rise of platform-based work has made it easier than ever for people to earn a living doing something they love. It has also created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and small business owners, who can use gig marketplaces to reach a global customer base.

This team helps businesses manage billing, tax, and revenue recognition. Stripe's RFA unit is expected to reach a $500 million annual run rate this year. To support this growth, the company completed an ""acqui-hire"" of a four-person team from Supaglue, an open-source developer platform for user-facing integrations. This team will help accelerate Stripe's real-time analytics and reporting across its platform and third-party apps for the RFA suite.

Supaglue was founded in 2021 by George Xing and Thomas Chen, who worked on the data teams at Lyft and Uber. The company realized that managing data and business metrics across teams was inconsistent and fragmented, which could lead to bad decisions and even worse business outcomes. Supaglue built a product that helps companies import and centralize customer data from third-party data sources like Salesforce or other customer relationship management systems into their own applications.

What caught the attention of Stripe? Mutual work acquaintances introduced Supaglue, and the two companies began having conversations. Stripe offered to buy Supaglue because it was also doing a fair amount of integration work. Supaglue's product is similar to a big part of the RFA suite, which is a unified data platform that reconciles data from each of its products and surfaces relevant insights to the end users of Stripe via dashboards, alerts, customer reporting, and real-time analytics.

Stripe has been busy this year, with employee stock sale deals, partnerships with companies like authentication startup Clerk, and an electric boat startup Navier. The Supaglue acqui-hire is one of many things going on at Stripe, and it is likely to quickly find fast friends within Stripe's ecosystem.

Podcast Lovers, Beware: Google to Shutdown Its Podcasts App Soon

In a shocking announcement, Google has revealed that it will be shutting down its popular Podcasts app in the US in the coming days. To make the transition as smooth as possible, users will need to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music by April 2, 2024. 

The Google Podcasts app, which has been downloaded over 500 million times on Android devices worldwide, has been a go-to destination for podcast enthusiasts. The app offered a simple and user-friendly interface for discovering, following, and listening to podcasts, as well as tools to add podcasts via RSS feed. Unfortunately, the tech giant has decided to wind down the Podcasts app as part of its broader plan to centralize its audio services under YouTube.

Google Podcasts app was first launched in 2018, and despite its popularity, it remained a separate entity from YouTube Music until late 2023. YouTube Music was able to support podcasts globally by the end of 2023 and had the ability to upload their RSS feeds in February.

The move to shift podcasting to YouTube could help Google become a bigger player in the space, not only by merging its efforts and sharpening its focus but also because interest in video podcasts, which were already popular on YouTube, is on the rise. For instance, Spotify announced a deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) this week to bring video podcasts to U.S. users of its streaming app.

Bleeping Computer was the first to notice the shutdown date for Google Podcasts in the US, and a support page on Google's site confirms that users in the US will only be able to use the Podcasts app through the end of March 2024. Users who miss the in-app pop-ups can still export their subscriptions through July 2024.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but after publication, they confirmed that while they are still ""tracking towards"" the April 2 timeline for the US, they have not shared a timeline for the rest of the world yet.

From earlier statements, it is clear that the plan is to discontinue Google Podcasts globally in 2024. 

So, podcast lovers, it's time to start searching for a new podcasting platform.

The Office of Cybersecurity has deemed Copilot to be a security risk, citing the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services. While there are no restrictions on using Copilot on personal phones and laptops, it will now be blocked on all Windows devices owned by the Congress.

This comes after a similar ban on the use of ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by OpenAI's large language models, on House computers was set last year. However, staffers were still allowed to use the paid version of ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus) for research and evaluation due to its tighter privacy controls.

Recently, the White House issued rules for federal agencies to follow when it comes to generative AI, which would ensure that any tool they use does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans. Microsoft has recognized the need for higher security requirements and has announced a roadmap of tools and services meant for government use, including an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant.

Szpindor's office will evaluate the government version Copilot when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. While the ban on Copilot may seem restrictive, it is important to ensure the security of sensitive data and protect the privacy of Congressional staff members.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"""Microsoft Copilot is no longer allowed on Congressional staff's government-issued devices due to security concerns.

Introduction:

The space industry is rapidly evolving, and one of the most exciting developments in recent years is the emergence of companies like Orbit Fab. This startup is revolutionizing the way we think about space propulsion by creating orbital gas stations, or ""gas cap"" systems, for satellites. In this article, we'll explore how Orbit Fab is leveraging its innovative technology to provide a unique and valuable service to the space industry.

Body:

Orbit Fab's Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface (RAFTI) is a game-changer in the world of space exploration. This docking mechanism is designed to transfer propellant from an orbital tanker to a customer spacecraft, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for refueling satellites in orbit. The RAFTI is now flight-qualified and available on the market, with each port priced at just $30,000.

The idea for the RAFTI began with Orbit Fab CEO and co-founder Daniel Faber, who has been working in the space industry for decades. As part of his previous work at Deep Space Industries, Faber developed satellite thrusters for orbital maneuvering. This experience led him to believe that the next big opportunity in the space industry was in-space refueling.

The potential revenue generated from extra kilograms of propellant is significant in the space industry. Faber notes that spacecraft are optimized with the amount of fuel they have, and when they run out, an extra kilogram of propellant could generate a million dollars in marginal revenue. This is why Orbit Fab saw the need for orbital gas stations to complement existing satellite servicing capabilities.

Orbit Fab's technology is ambitious, but the architecture is relatively simple. The company sells two products: fuel and fueling ports. The RAFTI can also be used to fuel spacecraft on the ground prior to launch. Once a RAFTI-equipped satellite runs out of propellant, one of Orbit Fab's tankers can pick up some fuel from orbital depots and deliver it straight to the customer's satellite for refueling.

However, developing the RAFTI was no easy task. There are many variables to consider, including cost, impact on the customer spacecraft, and compliance with standards from NASA, the Space Force, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Faber notes that nailing each part of the hardware was critical, and it took years to ensure the RAFTI met all the necessary requirements.

Conclusion:

Orbit Fab's RAFTI is a revolutionary concept that has the potential to transform the space industry. With the increasing demand for satellite services, the need for efficient and cost-effective refueling solutions has never been greater. The RAFTI is a testament to Orbit Fab's innovative spirit and commitment to providing value to the space industry. As the first RAFTI-equipped satellites go to orbit later this year, we can expect to see the beginning of a new era in space exploration.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An-Orbit-Fab-fuel-shuttle-is-docking-with-an-on-orbit-satellite-equipped-with-a-RAFTI-refueling-port.jpg?resize=1200,817",2024-03-29 18:34:11,"Looking for an efficient and cost-effective solution for refueling satellites in orbit?
