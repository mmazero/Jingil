Redis is a widely popular data store that is used in many large commercial and open-source deployments.

Redis was launched in 2009 by Salvatore Sanfilippo under the BSD license, which allowed Sanfilippo to create a commercial fork in the future. In 2021, Redis Labs, the commercial arm of Redis, changed its licensing from the permissive 3-clause BSD license to the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL). This change made Redis-as-a-service incompatible with the standard definition of “open source,” and it was widely expected that a fork of Redis would be created.

AWS and Google Cloud, two of the largest cloud providers, rarely back an open-source fork together. Yet, when Redis Labs switched to the SSPL, a fork was always one of the most likely outcomes. At the time of the license change, AWS and Google Cloud were already major Redis service providers.

Redis Labs CEO Rowan Trollope reiterated that the major cloud service providers profited from the open-source version and were free to enter a commercial agreement with Redis, which explains why AWS, Google Cloud, and other companies backed Valkey.

Valkey was initiated at AWS by longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson, who started the project in her own GitHub account. The original Redis private channel included five maintainers, including three from Redis, Olson, and Alibaba’s Zhao Zhao. The maintainers from Redis did not sign on, but as David Nally, AWS’s director for open-source strategy and marketing, noted, the Valkey community would welcome them with open arms.

Redis’s Trollope emphasized that Redis Labs’ licensing change opened the door for cloud service providers to establish fair licensing agreements with Redis Inc. Microsoft has already come to an agreement with Redis Inc., and the company is open to creating similar relationships with AWS and Google Cloud.

In conclusion, the launch of Valkey marks a significant moment in the open-source community, as it demonstrates the power of community and the willingness of major corporations to collaborate and support open-source projects. While the licensing change may have caused some friction, it has also paved the way for Redis to continue to innovate and evolve in the open-source community.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"Redis Fork: Valkey Launched by AWS, Google Cloud, and Redis, Promoting Open-Source | Boost Your SEO with Meta Descriptions | Get Help Now", Valkey Redis Fork ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

","Bridging the Gap: How Brands Can Foster a More Inclusive AI Future

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant advancements in various industries, including healthcare, transportation, and finance. However, as AI continues to evolve, it is essential to ensure that it benefits everyone, regardless of their background or social status. This is where brands can play a crucial role in fostering a more inclusive AI future.

The following are some ways brands can promote a more inclusive AI:

1. Encourage diversity in the AI workforce

One of the most significant barriers to a more inclusive AI future is the lack of diversity in the tech industry. Brands can promote diversity by actively recruiting and hiring individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities. This not only helps to ensure that AI solutions are more accessible and inclusive but also fosters innovation and creativity.

2. Address bias in AI algorithms

AI algorithms can perpetuate bias if they are not designed with diversity and inclusivity in mind. Brands can address this issue by developing and implementing algorithms that minimize bias and consider the experiences of diverse individuals. Additionally, brands can engage with diverse communities to understand their needs and concerns and incorporate them into their AI development processes.

3. Foster transparency in AI decision-making

AI solutions can have a significant impact on individuals' lives, such as determining loan approvals, hiring decisions, and criminal justice outcomes. However, if these decisions are made by opaque algorithms, it can be challenging for individuals to understand how they are being made and to contest them if necessary. Brands can promote transparency by providing explanations for how their AI systems make decisions and allowing individuals to challenge these decisions if they feel they are unfair or discriminatory.

4. Encourage responsible AI use

AI solutions can be misused, such as using them for surveillance or to violate individuals' privacy. Brands can encourage responsible AI use by educating their customers about the potential risks and benefits of AI and providing guidelines on how to use AI solutions responsibly. Brands can also work with policymakers to develop regulations that ensure AI solutions are used ethically and responsibly.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/tiktok-ban-implication-amazon/,TikTok ban could harm Amazon sellers looking for alternatives, TikTok Ban Affects Amazon Sellers' E-commerce Options ,"

Is the TikTok ban bad news for Amazon sellers?

In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could force ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban in U.S. app stores. While the focus of the debate has been on American data security and speech rights, the potential move also highlights something else: TikTok's growing focus on e-commerce and how it is impacting small merchants.

TikTok has become an alternative marketplace for Amazon sellers looking to expand their customer bases. The app's focus on curated branded goods and short video format has attracted sellers, especially those from China. However, the interplay of tech giants and geopolitics is squeezing smaller merchants.

In recent months, TikTok has been trying to boost its e-commerce business, with a strong dose of curation to its platform. Incentives such as subsidies and algorithms have also encouraged merchants to sell goods on the app. The app's massive engagement, especially among young shoppers, has also made it an attractive platform for sellers.

Consumer behavior also supports TikTok's e-commerce impact, with nearly 20% of consumers beginning their search for products on TikTok in the first quarter of 2023. This is particularly true among younger consumers, with 40% of Gen Z shoppers preferring TikTok for search instead of Google.

However, the political backlash against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance could impact the app's e-commerce growth. If a ban is put in place, it could prematurely end TikTok's e-commerce dream and limit the options for sellers seeking new channels.

In conclusion, the TikTok ban could have a significant impact on Amazon sellers looking for alternatives. While TikTok is growing its focus on e-commerce, the interplay of tech giants and geopolitics could limit its growth and leave smaller merchants with fewer options.

In a world increasingly reliant on cutting-edge communication technologies, Professor Jeongho Kwak from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST has taken a significant step towards enhancing 6G mobile vision services (1). His novel learning model and resource optimization technology promise to transform how we approach these advanced capabilities.

Mobile vision services encompass groundbreaking innovations like augmented reality (AR) and self-driving cars. Rapid video and image capture, along with deep learning-driven content analysis, characterize these services. However, delivering top-notch results necessitates powerful GPUs and precise learning models—a challenge previous technologies failed to tackle effectively. Often treating learning models and computing/networking resources separately led to suboptimal performance and poor resource allocation on mobile devices.

Enter Professor Kwak's game-changing solution: VisionScaling, an integrated learning model and computing/networking optimization algorithm designed specifically for 6G vision services. By merging learning models and resources, this pioneering method reduces energy consumption by at least 30%, all while preserving comparable accuracy to existing approaches (2). Moreover, there's no sacrifice when it comes to average target accuracy or time delays.

Adaptable and versatile, VisionScaling adjusts to ever-evolving mobile settings thanks to its implementation of Online Convex Optimization (OCO)—one of today's most sophisticated learning techniques. With OCO, the system maintains peak functionality regardless of whether future conditions are known beforehand. In essence, VisionScaling guarantees superb performance in fluctuating, uncertain environments.

But does theory meet practice? Absolutely! Testing the algorithm in real-world scenarios yielded impressive outcomes. Embedded AI devices and linked edge computing systems allowed researchers to confirm a substantial 30% reduction in energy usage and improvements of up to 39% in end-to-end latency relative to earlier algorithms (3).

Reflecting on his achievement, Professor Kwak noted, ""This study offers twofold contributions – first, demonstrating effectiveness in challenging, real-life contexts; second, employing dynamic optimization and learning methods to substantiate exceptional performance. This innovation establishes a solid basis for data-intensive mobile applications demanding increased memory and processing capacity"" (1).

Indeed, publishing the findings in the esteemed IEEE Internet of Things Journal underscores the significance of this breakthrough (4). Expect further developments building upon this remarkable foundation, reshaping our interaction with next-gen mobile services.

People thought it was Google's April Fool's Day joke,Title: The Unbelievable Beginnings of Gmail - How Google's Email Service Revolutionized Communication,"Title: The Unbelievable Beginnings of Gmail

Introduction:

Google's Gmail has been one of the most successful email services in the world. It's hard to imagine life without Gmail, but did you know that it started as an April Fool's prank? In this article, we'll explore the unbelievable beginnings of Gmail and how it has evolved into the powerful email service it is today.

Body:

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin loved to pull pranks, and their April Fool's Day pranks became legendary. One year, they posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, they said they planned to roll out a ""scratch and sniff"" feature on their search engine. However, their biggest prank of all was the launch of Gmail.

On April 1, 2004, Gmail was unveiled to the world. At the time, it offered 1 gigabyte of storage per account, which seemed like an impossibly large amount of email capacity. In comparison, the leading webmail services of the time, Yahoo and Microsoft, offered only 30 to 60 emails of storage. Gmail's 1 gigabyte of storage was 250 to 500 times more than what was available in other webmail services.

Besides its massive storage capacity, Gmail also came with Google's search technology, allowing users to quickly find a tidbit from an old email, photo, or other personal information stored on the service. It also automatically threaded together a string of communications about the same topic, making everything flow together as if it was a single conversation.

Former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who helped design Gmail and other company products, described the original pitch they put together as all about the three ""S's"" - storage, search, and speed. This mind-bending concept made people question what was possible within a web browser.

It took three years to build Gmail as part of a project called ""Caribou."" The name Caribou was a reference to a running gag in the Dilbert comic strip, and it made everyone laugh. In fact, after The Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on the afternoon of April Fool's 2004, readers began calling and emailing to inform the news agency that it had been duped by Google's pranksters.

However, Google wasn't joking about Gmail. An AP reporter was abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make the trip worthwhile. After arriving at a still-developing corporate campus that would soon become known as the ""Googleplex,"" the AP reporter was ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while sitting in front of his laptop computer.

Page, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail's sleekly designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within Microsoft's now-retired Explorer web browser. He pointed out that there was no delete button featured in the main control window because it wouldn't be necessary, given Gmail's vast storage and the ease with which it could be searched.

Today, Gmail has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts, each offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. Despite this, many users still hoard their email, photos, and other content, which is why companies like Google, Apple, and others now make money from selling additional storage capacity in their data centers.

Conclusion:

The unbelievable beginnings of Gmail are a testament to Google's innovative spirit and its ability to think outside the box. From its initial prank to its current dominance in the email market, Gmail has revolutionized the way we communicate and store our data.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/gmail-revolutionized-e.jpg,2024-03-31 06:31:14,"Gmail started as an April Fool's prank that offered 1GB of free storage, revolutionizing the email industry.

","AI Transformation in the Security Workforce: A Vision for the Future

The world of security workforce is rapidly evolving, and AI is poised to play a significant role in shaping its future. In this blog post, we will explore the potential benefits and challenges of using AI in the security workforce, and what it means for the industry as a whole.

Benefits of AI in the Security Workforce

AI has the potential to revolutionize the way security teams operate. One of the most significant benefits is the end of grunt work for developers. With AI-powered language models, developers can describe a desired outcome and get perfectly formatted code in response. These models can also check existing code to identify typos, punctuation mistakes, and other errors that drive developers crazy.

Another advantage of AI in the security workforce is the ability to create more efficient and streamlined frameworks. Software frameworks like Spring, Express.js, and Django have already revolutionized the industry by providing developers with consistent guidelines and prewritten code for common functions. With AI, these frameworks can be further enhanced by creating boilerplate code, automating repetitive tasks, and suggesting code optimizations.

AI can also help customize framework components to a specific project. This level of customization can lead to more effective and efficient development, ultimately improving the overall security of the organization.

Challenges of AI in the Security Workforce

While AI holds many potential benefits, it also presents some challenges for the security workforce. One of the most significant challenges is the risk of over-testing. Because AI-powered bots can create as many test scripts as needed, there is a risk that organizations could end up with too many tests, which can slow down projects and create bottlenecks.

Another challenge of AI in the security workforce is the potential for skills degradation. While AI can automate many tasks, it doesn't replace the importance of human expertise and creativity. As AI becomes more prevalent in the industry, developers may become lazy and rely too heavily on AI-generated code, resulting in bloated, inefficient, and poorly performing code.

Finally, the security workforce must be aware of the trust deficit that can arise from using AI. AI-generated code is only as good as the quality of the data used to train the model. Poor quality data, training shortcuts, and l",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rays-of-code-like-the-rays-of-the-sun-tlj00jOCQASpmpShHxPbkA-fqYKCDpMQ8a7wneyM-sPbA-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-31 19:05:00,"AI Transformation in the Security Workforce: A Vision for the Future

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-has-reportedly-been-blocked-on-all-congress-owned-devices-034946166.html,Microsoft Copilot has reportedly been blocked on all Congress-owned devices, Microsoft Copilot Blocked on All Congress-Owned Devices ,"The US Congress has recently prohibited the use of Microsoft's Copilot on government-issued devices. This decision was made by House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor, who deemed the AI chatbot to be a security risk. The Office of Cybersecurity has expressed concern that Copilot could leak House data to non-House approved cloud services. While there is no ban on the use of Copilot on personal devices, it has been prohibited on all Windows devices owned by Congress.

This move comes almost a year after the Congress banned staffers from using ChatGPT's free version on House computers. However, they were allowed to continue using the paid version for research and evaluation due to its tighter privacy controls. The White House also recently revealed rules federal agencies have to follow when using generative AI, which would ensure that any tool they use does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans.

Microsoft has recognized the need for higher security requirements in government use and has announced a roadmap of tools and services meant for this purpose. The company has also launched an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant. All these tools and services will feature higher levels of security to make them suitable for handling sensitive data.

Szpindor's office will evaluate the Copilot version for government use when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. While this decision may be controversial, it is necessary to ensure the security of sensitive government data.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"Optimized Meta Description:
