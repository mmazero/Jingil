The latest update allows some Threads users to send messages directly to Instagram from their profiles. While it simplifies communication, there are limitations and usability concerns that need addressing.","Title: A Surprise Messaging Feature Comes to Threads Users: An Unexpected Connection Between Two Platforms

In a surprising turn of events, some Threads users have noticed an unexpected addition: a ""Message"" button appearing atop their fellow users' profiles. However, instead of enabling direct messaging within the app itself, tapping the button sends a message directly to Instagram – a move that may leave users puzzled and slightly underwhelmed. Let's delve deeper into this intriguing development and its implications for both platforms.

While Threads initially required an Instagram account upon signup, users were previously unable to engage in direct messaging through the platform. As Meta-owned properties, these two applications already shared several integrated functionalities; however, direct messaging was not among them until now. According to a Meta spokesperson, this recent change serves as an extension of the existing capability to post content from Threads onto Instagram. It also enables select users to transmit messages between the two services while remaining within Threads.

This update aims to streamline communication by allowing users to contact others without switching back and forth between applications. Nevertheless, various limitations accompany this seemingly convenient enhancement. First, Meta assumes that users maintain identical friend lists across both platforms, potentially causing confusion when attempting to reach acquaintances exclusively active on either platform. Additionally, responding to incoming messages remains cumbersome since replying requires navigating to Instagram. Lastly, merging the messaging experiences of two distinct social media networks presents inherent usability concerns. While Meta continues working on improving the Direct Message (DM) experience on Threads, users must navigate around its current shortcomings.

Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, had expressed reservations regarding integrating a standalone messaging inbox within Threads during a Q&A session last year. He pointed out two possible solutions—either duplicating the Instagram inbox inside Threads, leading to potential complications related to handling multiple notifications, or developing a unique inbox system specifically tailored for Threads. Neither solution appeared ideal, leaving uncertainty surrounding the future direction of Threads' messaging capabilities.

Despite its flaws, the latest messaging integration offers a glimmer of hope for those seeking improved interaction between these two popular Meta products. By blending elements from both worlds, the company could pave the way towards seamless cross-platform communication.

Instagram's Threads Introduces ""Recent"" Filter for Search Results

Introduction:
In a world where staying updated with real-time information is crucial, Meta-owned social networking platform, Threads, recently announced an exciting update – the addition of a ""Recent"" filter for sorted search results. This long-awaited feature will enable users to access the latest posts quickly, making the app even more dynamic and interactive. Let's dive deeper into what this change entails and how it might impact your experience using the app.

The New Feature: A Closer Look
Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, shared via Twitter that Threads would start testing the ""Recent"" filter as part of a limited release among select users. Currently, when searching through Threads, users have the option to choose between two categories: ""Top"" and ""Recent."" However, the latter doesn't display posts chronologically; instead, the algorithm prioritizes newer posts over older ones. As a result, this provides users with a much more streamlined way to discover fresh content without being overwhelmed by excessively old entries.

Previous Missteps & Learning Opportunities
Interestingly enough, Threads initially released the ""Recent"" filter earlier this year, though it turned out to be merely an internal prototype accessible to just a handful of individuals. In response to concerns about potential safety issues associated with such a feature, Mosseri explained last November that enabling users to browse all posts related to certain keywords in reverse chronological order could lead to increased visibility of harmful material. By introducing the current iteration of the ""Recent"" filter, which focuses solely on surfacing recent content rather than every single post containing particular keywords, Threads appears to address these previous misgivings effectively while still offering enhanced functionality to its users.

Implications for Users
This development is especially significant given that many users rely upon social media platforms like Threads to stay informed regarding breaking news events, trending topics, and viral challenges. With the ability to narrow down their searches based on relevance and currency, users may enjoy a more seamless browsing experience overall. Moreover, creators benefit too since their up-to-date posts become increasingly discoverable thanks to the ""Recent"" filter's focus on showcasing fresher content first.

Revolutionizing Online Security: AI-Driven Multicolor Holograms using Metasurfaces & Cholesterics","Title: Revolutionizing Online Security: AI-Driven Multicolor Holograms with Adjustable Wavelengths

In our digitally connected world, protecting personal data has become a top priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, researchers constantly seek innovative solutions to strengthen online security measures. A groundbreaking study led by Professor Junsuk Rho and his team at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), in collaboration with Dr. Sunae So and Professors Young-Ki Kim and their respective PhD/MS students, offers a promising development in this area. This multidisciplinary effort combines cutting-edge technologies – artificial intelligence (AI), metasurfaces, and oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystals – resulting in a sophisticated encryption system capable of generating vibrant holograms with precise control over color and shape.

Traditionally, encryption methods rely on complex algorithms to safeguard sensitive information. However, these approaches often face challenges when dealing with large volumes of data. To tackle this limitation, the POSTECH team devised an ingenious solution using an inverse design approach powered by AI. By encoding intricate patterns spanning ten distinct wavelengths between 420 and 720 nanometers, they created ten unique holograms displaying assorted colors and shapes.

A key innovation in this work involves the integration of an adaptive wavelength modulator based on oblique helicoidal cholesterics. These materials exhibit exceptional abilities to selectively reflect particular light wavelengths depending upon subtle variations in their internal layered structures. Crucially, these changes can be triggered by external factors like electric fields and temperature fluctuations. This feature permits accurate reflection of targeted light bands (within a width of less than 30 nanometers) across a broad spectral range extending from 400 to 720 nanometers.

By merging this adaptive material with metasurface technology, the researchers achieved something remarkable: creating multiple independent holograms featuring diverse colors and forms that could swiftly alternate amongst themselves. More impressively, they constructed an optical security apparatus necessitating specified electric fields and thermal settings for decoding the encoded hologram. According to Professors Rho and Kim, further expansion of external stimulus parameters—such as magnetic fields, specific light wavelengths, and electrical field frequencies—could lead to the creation of a highly secure optical encryption platform supporting full-color or pictorial holograms. Such advancements would place this technology at the forefront of next-generation display applications.

In summary, the novel application of AI-driven inverse design techniques combined with metasurfaces and oblique helicoidal cholesterics showcases great potential in revolutionizing online security through vivid multicolored holograms with fine-tuned wavelength selection.

After a prolonged period of easy money, the AI industry is currently experiencing a shift. According to a recent report from Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), global investment in AI declined for the second consecutive year in 2023. Both private investment in startups and corporate investment through mergers and acquisitions took a dip in 2023 compared to the previous year.

In 2023, AI-related mergers and acquisitions decreased by 31.2% from the previous year, reaching $80.61 billion. Private investment also experienced a slight decline, dropping from $103.4 billion in 2022 to $95.99 billion. When accounting for minority stake deals and public offerings, total investment in AI decreased by 20% in 2023, amounting to $189.2 billion.

Despite the overall decline, some AI ventures continue to secure substantial investments. For instance, Anthropic recently received a multibillion-dollar investment from Amazon, and Microsoft acquired Inflection AI's top talent for $650 million. Moreover, the number of AI startups announcing funding increased by 40.6% in 2023 compared to 2022.

Several factors contribute to this shift in the AI investment landscape. Gartner analyst John-David Lovelock observes that AI investing is becoming more widespread, with the largest players like Anthropic and OpenAI staking their claims. Meanwhile, Umesh Padval, managing director at Thomvest Ventures, attributes the decline to slower-than-expected growth and the challenges of scaling AI technologies in real-world applications.

Greylock partner Seth Rosenberg asserts that investor appetite for new players in the AI space has waned, while Aaron Fleishman, a partner at Tola Capital, suggests that investors might be relying less on projected exponential growth to justify AI startups' valuations.

Assessing Apple Vision Pro's Post-Launch Performance ","

How is Apple's Vision Pro doing after a few months of its launch? The company's ambitious bet on computers that are worn on the face instead of sitting on the desk made a big splash when it was announced and later released. However, the excitement seems to have died down faster than expected.

As someone who has always been a long-term believer in augmented reality, virtual reality, and face-computers in general, I remember my first experience with the Microsoft HoloLens project as one of the most exciting moments for my love of technology. So it is with a bit of disappointment that the hype around the Apple Vision Pro has faded more quickly than I expected.

Of course, with its Pro moniker, expensive price tag, and uneven developer support so far, the new Apple device has a long road ahead of it. But I was hoping that the Apple brand would keep the hardware in the news and at the top of our minds longer than it did after its launch.

For now, we know very little about the device's popularity. We know that some people returned theirs and TechCrunch's review was middling-to-positive. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that most people took their Apple Vision Pro back or that some users are enjoying the gadget more than we did.

I hope that Apple and Meta, with its Quest line of VR headsets, don't give up just yet. I find it hard to believe that my monitors should be akin to digital chalkboards when they should be built into my glasses. So let's hit play and have some fun.

Introduction

In the world of mobile applications, there's always room for nostalgia. Recently, Apple decided to relax its rules regarding retro game emulators on the App Store following pressure from EU regulations. This decision led to the short-lived appearance of iGBA, a Game Boy emulator app for iPhone users. However, its stay didn't last long due to copyright concerns raised by Riley Testut, creator of the alternative storefront AltStore and popular Nintendo emulator Delta. In this article, we will delve deeper into the story behind these two emulators, their similarities, differences, and what ultimately led to the demise of one.

Body

When Apple initially loosened restrictions on retro game emulators, developers saw an opportunity to bring gaming experiences from yesteryear to modern devices. Among those quick to take advantage were creators of iGBA—an ad-supported copy of the open-source project GBA4iOS. Users could download both Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color ROMs via the internet and enjoy playing them using this newfound application. Though seemingly harmless, problems began brewing once it became apparent that iGBA utilized the same codebase as GBA4iOS without proper consent or credit given.

Riley Testut, responsible for developing AltStore and Delta, expressed frustration upon discovering iGBA's existence. His issue stemmed primarily from three aspects:

1. Apple greenlit iGBA even though Delta, already available through TestFlight, remained unreleased since March 5;
2. iGBA contained advertisements and user tracking mechanisms, thus exploiting Testut's work for profit;
3. Most importantly, the blatant misappropriation of intellectual property infringed upon Testut's rights as a developer.

Though critics contended that GBA4iOS fell under the GNU GPL v2 license – permitting copies unless explicitly restricted – Testut implemented a unique clause expressly forbidding App Store distribution. Despite initial approval, Apple eventually conceded to removing iGBA due to violation of its guidelines concerning spamming and copyright infringement (Rules 4.3 and 5.2). Essentially, Apple acknowledged Testut's claims and acted accordingly, albeit belatedly.

Conclusion

Tesla, the trailblazing electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy company, recently announced a significant restructuring, affecting more than 10% of its global workforce. The layoffs, presented as a ""company-wide restructuring,"" aim to reduce costs, increase productivity, and prepare the organization for its ""next phase of growth."" This decision comes as Tesla navigates a highly competitive EV market, price wars, and an ambitious pursuit of fully self-driving cars.

Financial Performance and Market Dynamics

The layoffs were largely attributed to Tesla's financial performance, which has seen its profit margin narrow over the past several quarters. The price war among EV manufacturers has persisted for at least a year, prompting Tesla to repeatedly slash prices to maintain its competitive edge and boost sales. Despite delivering a record 1.81 million vehicles in 2023, Tesla's margins took a hit due to these aggressive pricing strategies.

The Restructuring and its Impact

Tesla informed employees that the restructuring would impact more than 14,000 workers across all departments and seniority levels. While some departments faced layoffs amounting to 10%, others saw a 20% reduction in workforce. A manager shared with TechCrunch, ""I lost 20% of my team, some really good players too.""

High performers were not spared from the layoffs, according to sources familiar with the matter. Many talented employees were let go, particularly those working on projects that have recently fallen lower on Tesla's priority list.

Shifting Focus: Fully Self-Driving Cars and Robotaxis

The restructuring coincides with Tesla's ongoing efforts to build fully self-driving cars and a robotaxi service. Musk announced that the company would no longer pursue building a lower-cost EV, instead focusing resources on the development of an alleged robotaxi. Musk had previously expressed his desire for a ""clean robotaxi"" with no steering wheel or pedals, but the company's leadership team, including Franz von Holzhausen and Lars Moravy, convinced him to continue working on both projects. The robotaxi is now scheduled to debut on August 8","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1239416832.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-16 12:35:03,Discover how Tesla's strategic restructuring paves the way for a new era of growth and innovation!

Exploring the depths of our oceans becomes easier with innovative biomimetic robot fish improving maneuverability and efficiency in underwater navigation.","Title: Biomimetic Robot Fish: A New Era of Underwater Exploration

Introduction

Did you know that over 80% of the Earth's ocean remains unexplored? One reason for this astonishing statistic is the difficulty associated with deep-sea exploration, given factors such as immense pressure, complete darkness, and frigid temperatures. Nonetheless, growing curiosity about the ocean and its resources has motivated scientists to construct better tools capable of withstanding extreme conditions. Recently, researchers have turned towards biomimicry, borrowing inspiration from nature—specifically, fish—to build innovative deep-sea submersibles. By studying how various fish species navigate through challenging underwater terrains, engineers aim to revolutionize submarine technology, making them faster, quieter, and more efficient.

Milestones in Submersible Development

Throughout history, submersible evolution has seen significant advancements. Early subs relied upon outdated technologies and materials; these vessels tended to be bulky, cumbersome, and dependent on fossil fuels. With improvements came remotely operated submersibles, leading to reduced operational expenses and increased safety. Modern submarines benefit from strong yet lightweight materials, enabling smaller, agile, and cost-effective designs. While recent progress has transformed the industry, further innovation looms on the horizon.

Biomimetic Revolution

As the name implies, biomimetic robotic fish-like submersibles draw inspiration from actual fish. Rather than employing conventional propellers, these groundbreaking machines move fluidly by undulating sideways, similar to their biological counterparts. Consequently, such devices offer enhanced mobility, energy savings, and diminished acoustic signatures. Moreover, imitating natural fish behaviors results in minimal disruption to surrounding waters. Although numerous technical obstacles remain, ambitious teams worldwide work diligently to overcome these challenges.

Key Technological Hurdles

Creating successful biomimetic robotic fish demands surmounting formidable barriers. Firstly, replicating intricate sensory systems found in real fish requires extensive collaboration among experts across multiple disciplines, including hydrodynamics, materials science, and AI. Secondly, achieving optimal performance and responsiveness in varying environmental situations poses another daunting challenge.

Designing Practical Solutions

Recognizing the importance of bridging theory and practice, some research groups actively engineer functional prototypes suited for real-world application. An example is China's Westlake University, where engineers developed the ""Sea Guru I""—an initial attempt at creating a useful biomimetic robotic fish-submarine hybrid. Though still in early stages, projects like this pave the way for exciting discoveries and breakthroughs in underwater exploration.

Conclusion

While oceans cover approximately 71% of Earth's surface, humanity knows relatively little about what lurks beneath. Fortunately, advances in submersible technology bring us closer to unlocking secrets hidden thousands of meters below sea level. Applying biomimetics could significantly impact underwater travel and discovery. Through ongoing efforts to tackle remaining challenges, researchers inch ever closer to realizing fully-functional biomimetic robotic fish-type submersibles. Ultimately, these achievements promise not just greater knowledge but potentially revolutionary insights into untapped resources and ecosystems teeming with life.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/mimicking-fish-to-crea.jpg,2024-04-15 11:53:40,"Meta Description:

Introduction

Elon Musk, the CEO of X, has recently announced plans to combat the platform's bot problem by charging new users a small fee to enable posting. With this new policy, Musk aims to curb the influx of bots and troll farms that have been plaguing the social network.

The Bot Problem and Musk's Solution

In response to a post about updates on X's website, Musk stated that charging a small fee to new accounts was the ""only way"" to stop the ""onslaught of bots."" Currently, artificial intelligence and troll farms can easily bypass tools like CAPTCHA, making it difficult to distinguish between human and bot activity. Musk later clarified that new accounts would be able to post after three months without paying a fee, making it clear that this policy targets only new users.

Although specifics about the fee and implementation timeline are yet to be disclosed, X has already taken steps towards addressing the bot issue. In October of last year, the platform began charging new unverified users $1 annually in New Zealand and the Philippines. These users could read posts but were unable to interact with them unless they paid a fee. Musk may consider implementing a similar fee structure in other regions.

Additionally, X recently announced a major purge of spam accounts, warning users that their follower count might be affected. With the new plan to charge new users, the social media giant aims to further tackle the bot problem and maintain a secure platform.

Musk's AI Initiatives

While Musk has been vocal about combating AI bots, X updated its policy last year to allow public posts to be used to train machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence models. Musk's AI company, xAI, also announced plans to use public posts to train models.

Recently, xAI made its Grok chatbot available to Premium users of X, who pay $8 per month. According to a recent Fortune report, X plans to make Grok available to all users for composing posts, further integrating AI technology into the platform.

Conclusion

Musk's plan to charge new users a fee to combat bots on X signifies the company's commitment to maintaining a secure and authentic platform. By charging new users a small fee, X aims to curb the influx of bots and troll farms, ensuring a more enjoyable experience for its users. With the recent purge of spam accounts and the integration of AI technology, X is taking significant steps to address the bot issue and create a safer social media environment.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-15 18:48:56,"""Fight bots on X: Musk's new user fee targets AI accounts.
