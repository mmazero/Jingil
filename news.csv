A groundbreaking development in the field of power electronics is set to transform the landscape of energy storage and conversion solutions. Researchers from Kobe University, Japan, and National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan, have joined forces to create a superior DC-DC power converter, surpassing its predecessors in efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. This innovative device promises to significantly enhance system stability and simplicity while interfacing seamlessly with a wide range of energy sources.

The debate over the kind of electric power to be used in national power grids, known as the ""Current War"" of the late 19th century, was settled in favor of AC (alternating current). However, solar power, batteries in electric vehicles, and computers rely on DC (direct current), necessitating less efficient AC-to-DC conversion. To address this issue, the establishment of DC microgrids is proposed. These microgrids integrate various renewable DC energy sources and storage devices, delivering energy directly to data centers and other DC appliances, eliminating the need for AC-to-DC conversion.

Engineers have long faced challenges in developing soft actuators, sensors, and wearables that are both lightweight and efficient. Conventional elastomers, while offering a range of mechanical properties, have been limited in their ability to form complex 3D structures with varying rigidity. Researchers at EPFL's School of Engineering have developed a groundbreaking solution: 3D-printable Double Network Granular Elastomers (DNGEs) with locally changing mechanical properties.

DNGEs: The Future of Soft Actuators and Robots

Elastomers are widely used in soft robotics and wearable devices due to their diverse mechanical characteristics, ranging from stiff to stretchy. However, creating elastomers that can be shaped into intricate 3D structures while maintaining varying levels of rigidity has been unattainable—until now. Esther Amstad, head of EPFL's Soft Materials Laboratory, and her team have engineered DNGEs, a 3D-printable material that can alter its mechanical properties in an unprecedented manner.

Eva Baur, a Ph.D. student in Amstad's lab, used DNGEs to print a prototype finger, complete with rigid ""bones"" enveloped by flexible ""flesh."" This demonstrates the technology's potential to manufacture devices capable of bending, stretching, and manipulating objects. DNGEs could pave the way for soft actuators, sensors, and wearables that are supple and firm, eliminating the need for heavy, cumbersome mechanical joints.

How DNGEs Work

DNGEs consist of two elastomeric networks that can be fine-tuned independently, allowing for a wide range of combinations of stiffness, toughness, and fatigue resistance. The first network determines the structure's overall stiffness, while the second network affects its fracture toughness. This dual-network setup enables DNGEs to be tailored for specific applications, such as soft actuators or wearable devices.

The use of elastomers over hydrogels, the material employed in state-of-the-art approaches, offers additional advantages.

Tesla pushes on with 1,800-mile electric semi truck charging corridor despite Biden funding snub. Exploring alternatives for state funding. Connecting 2 NA factories & a delayed Mexican facility. [82 characters]","Title: Tesla's Electric Big Rig Corridor: A Push for Cleaner Transportation

Introduction

In a bold move towards sustainable transportation, Tesla is forging ahead with plans to establish an electric big rig charging corridor, despite being denied funding from a significant federal program. This action comes as part of President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aiming to clean up the notoriously dirty transportation sector.

The Original Plan

Tesla had initially sought nearly $100 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Combined with around $24 million of its own funds, the company aimed to construct nine electric semi-truck charging stations along the route from Laredo, Texas to Fremont, California. This corridor, if realized, would be the first-of-its-kind charging network, enabling long-distance and regional electric trucking.

The Snub and Potential Alternatives

Despite Tesla's successful track record in winning charging awards from the Infrastructure Act, it was not among the 47 recipients announced in January. This group received a total of $623 million for building electric vehicle charging and refueling stations across the country. Rohan Patel, a former VP at Tesla, suggested that the company might explore state funding opportunities or future rounds of the CFI program. Some sites along the proposed route are considered ""no-brainers"" for development, even without funding.

The Route and Infrastructure

The 1,800-mile route, if fully developed, would connect Tesla's two North American vehicle factories and a planned but delayed facility in Mexico. Each station was to be equipped with eight 750kW chargers for Tesla Semis and four chargers for other electric trucks. However, the effectiveness of the corridor might be compromised if the company cannot build all nine stations, which are situated at roughly equal distances along the route.

Competing Priorities and Challenges

The Biden administration allocated half of the CFI funding to build EV charging infrastructure in urban and rural communities, while the other half went to funding 11 ""corridor"" projects. Some of these projects are along the same I-10 corridor that forms part of Tesla's","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tesla-semi-charging.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-18 20:28:51,"Tesla's electric big rig corridor plan: A cleaner transportation future.

While Signal is already blocked in China by the country's Great Firewall, the removal of its app from the App Store may not make much difference, as users accessing the app from China would be unable to register or send messages.

This is not the first time Apple has removed apps at the direction of China's internet regulator. Last year, several generative AI apps were taken off Apple's China App Store shortly before Chinese regulations targeted at generative AI were due to take effect. In recent years, Apple has also removed popular censorship circumvention tools, RSS apps, podcast apps, and even a Quran app, among others.

The reason for WhatsApp and Threads' removal from Apple's Chinese App Store is not explicitly stated. According to Meredith Whittaker, Signal's president, Signal was already blocked in China by the country's Great Firewall. Threads, which launched in early July last year, has been blocked by China's Great Firewall, and users in China wanting to download it have to use a VPN to circumvent the censorship. Threads quickly landed in the top 5 on Apple's China App Store last summer, making it a more likely target for China's state censors.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-equitable-discussions-social-media-meronymity.html,"For more open and equitable public discussions on social media, try 'meronymity'", Balancing Anonymity & Credibility: MIT Introduces 'Meronymity' in LiTweeture ,"Anonymity in Public Discourse: The Middle Ground of Meronymity

Have you ever hesitated to share your thoughts in a group discussion due to the fear of being judged by your seniors? You're not alone. This common issue can lead to a lack of diversity in public discourse, especially when junior members of a community remain silent due to intimidation. While anonymous communication can help alleviate this fear, it also eliminates important social context and may result in toxic or inappropriate speech. To address these challenges, MIT researchers have developed a framework for identity disclosure in public conversations, known as ""meronymity.""

Meronymity, derived from the Greek words for ""partial"" and ""name,"" enables individuals to selectively reveal relevant, verified aspects of their identity in a public discussion space, providing a balance between anonymity and disclosure. The researchers implemented meronymity in a communication system called LiTweeture, aimed at helping junior scholars use social media to ask research questions while maintaining their credibility and shielding their exact identity.

In LiTweeture, users can reveal a few professional facts, such as their academic affiliation or expertise in a certain field, which lends credibility to their questions or answers. Users have the flexibility to choose what they reveal about themselves each time they compose a social media post. They can also leverage existing relationships for endorsements that help queries reach experts they might otherwise be reluctant to contact.

During a month-long study, junior academics who tested LiTweeture reported that meronymous communication made them feel more comfortable asking questions and encouraged them to engage with senior scholars on social media. Although this study focused on academia, meronymous communication could be applied to any community or discussion space, as it strikes a balance between credibility and social inhibition.

The researchers began by studying the motivations and social barriers scholars face when engaging online with other academics. They found that while academics find platforms like Twitter and Mastodon to be key resources when seeking help with research, they were often reluctant to ask for, discuss, or share recommendations due to concerns about appearing unknowledgeable or public embarrassment if their posts were ignored.

LiTweeture enables scholars to selectively present relevant facets of their identity when using social media to ask for research help. To ensure credibility, the researchers connected LiTweeture to Semantic Scholar, a web service",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2021/socialmedia.jpg,2024-04-18 14:01:44,"Discover meronymity: a balance between anonymity and disclosure for credible, open public discourse.

Introduction

To build AI systems that can collaborate seamlessly with humans, it's essential to have a solid understanding of human behavior. However, humans often exhibit suboptimal decision-making due to computational constraints, making it challenging to model their behavior accurately. A team of researchers from MIT and the University of Washington has developed a method to model the behavior of an agent, whether human or machine, by inferring their computational constraints. This article will discuss this novel approach and its potential implications for AI-human collaboration.

The Challenge of Modeling Human Behavior

Human decision-making is often suboptimal due to computational limitations. Modeling such behavior can be particularly difficult, as it requires accounting for these unknown constraints. To tackle this challenge, the researchers developed a method that infers an agent's computational constraints, or ""inference budget,"" by observing just a few traces of their previous actions.

Inference Budget: A Predictive Measure

The researchers demonstrate that their method can be employed to infer someone's navigation goals based on prior routes and predict players' subsequent moves in chess matches. The technique matches or outperforms another popular method for modeling decision-making. By understanding an agent's behavior and inferring their goals, AI systems can better respond to their human collaborators, making them more helpful and adaptable to human weaknesses.

A New Framework for Modeling Human Behavior

The researchers built a framework that infers an agent's depth of planning from prior actions and uses that information to model the agent's decision-making process. By observing the time an agent spends thinking before acting, the model can estimate the depth of planning and determine the agent's inference budget. This budget can then be used to predict how the agent would behave in similar situations.

Implications for AI-Human Collaboration

This research could significantly impact AI-human collaboration by enabling AI systems to better understand and respond to human behavior. By predicting human errors and adapting to human weaknesses, AI assistants can provide more effective support and assistance. Ultimately, this research could pave the way for more robust and natural AI-human collaboration in various applications, from everyday tasks to complex problem-solving scenarios.

Tri-stable energy harvesters lead way in converting low-freq. vibes to elec. energy, addressing miniat. electr. device power demands. Recent research explores controlling P-SSHI harvesters w/ colored noise for max. efficacy. SEOtitle energyharvesters technology","Title: Optimizing Power Output in Tri-Stable Energy Harvesters: A New Era for Small Electronic Devices

In the era of miniaturized electronics, the energy needs of numerous devices such as sensors, data transmitters, medical implants, and wearable consumer products like Fitbits can no longer be sustained by chemical batteries alone. This ever-growing demand for power can be addressed by energy harvesters, which convert ambient vibrational energy into electrical energy. Among various types of energy harvesters, tri-stable ones have proven to be the most efficient, capable of transforming even low-frequency random vibrations into alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC).

A recent study published in The European Physical Journal B delves into the optimization of tri-stable energy harvesters' properties to boost their power output. Conducted by Tingting Zhang and Yanfei Jin of Beijing Institute of Technology in China, the investigation focuses on non-linear energy harvesters, which can harness a broader bandwidth of vibrations compared to their linear predecessors. These harvesters convert mechanical energy from environmental random vibrations directly into AC, which is then rectified into DC to power electronic devices.

The researchers highlight the potential of control methods to amplify the energy harvesting capability of these systems. They optimized the control of a tri-stable energy harvester operating under a parallel synchronized switching system (P-SSHI) to obtain the most efficient DC power output from colored noise. Colored noise, as defined by Jin and Zhang, refers to a random vibrational signal containing various vibrational frequencies with fluctuating intensities, making it an ideal approximation of natural environmental vibrations.

The study revealed that energy harvesters controlled in this manner are more efficient than those without control. The theoretical calculations were further corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations. The researchers believe that optimizing the management circuit's design is the next crucial step to ensure the energy supply for these small, low-power electronic devices.

In conclusion, the optimization of tri-stable energy harvesters' properties presents an exciting opportunity to address the escalating energy demands of modern miniaturized electronics.

Google's robust security measures through Play Protect help secure millions of Android devices against harmful applications. However, no system is foolproof, leaving room for sneaky and cunning malware and spyware to slip through the cracks. In response, Google is reportedly working on a new feature called 'App Quarantining,' designed to isolate suspect apps before they cause significant damage.

First detected and tested in the Android 14 QPR2 Beta 1 in late 2023, the App Quarantining feature might debut in Android 15 or a subsequent release. Although Google has since removed the related developer page, traces of the functionality remain within the operating system.

Functionality Overview

The App Quarantining feature aims to prevent potentially harmful apps from interfering with the user experience while keeping them accessible for further investigation. When an app is quarantined, its windows, screens, notifications, and accessibility to other apps are blocked, making it virtually invisible.

However, despite initial findings, the availability of this feature remains uncertain due to several factors. First, the Google Play Store and Google Play Services do not request any related permissions, suggesting that the feature might not be released anytime soon. Additionally, the lack of a command-line option to manually quarantine an application implies that only select Google apps like Play Protect possess the necessary privileges to perform these actions.

How It Works

To quarantine an app, the operating system utilizes the same suspension mechanism employed by Google's Digital Wellbeing tool. By enabling the QUARANTINE_APPS permission, special apps and services – such as Play Protect – can restrict a suspect app's functionalities without completely removing it from the device.

When an app is quarantined, its windows and notifications disappear, preventing it from sending or receiving data. Moreover, other apps cannot interact with the quarantined app, effectively cutting off all communication channels. The app also loses access to system broadcasts and dialogues, ensuring minimal interference.

Future Implications

Should the App Quarantining feature become available to the public, it could significantly improve the overall security of Android devices. Malicious software poses a constant threat, and quarantining rather than immediately deleting flagged apps allows users to assess their importance and safety before taking decisive action.

For instance, if a seemingly legitimate app is found to contain hidden threats, users can choose to keep it isolated until they decide whether to remove it entirely or restore its full functionality once the issue has been resolved.

Do you ever find yourself yearning for the good old days of gaming, when the simplicity of games like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda brought countless hours of joy? If so, you're in luck! The gaming world has experienced a significant shift, making it possible to enjoy those classic games on your iPhone. This breakthrough is all thanks to the recent acceptance of retro game console emulator apps in the Apple App Store.

For years, emulator apps have been kept out of the App Store due to copyright issues. However, Apple's updated guidelines now allow these apps, giving users the ability to play games from consoles such as Game Boy, NES, and Nintendo 64 on their iPhones. Among the available emulators, Delta stands out as the most popular and highly-rated option, supporting game files (ROMs) from multiple retro consoles.

The inclusion of retro game emulators in the App Store is not without restrictions. Apple's guidelines are open-ended but specify that consoles like the Game Boy and Nintendo 64, which were released in 1989 and 1996, respectively, are acceptable. The developer behind Delta, Riley Testut, has been in the emulator business for years, and his expertise is evident in Delta's polished and feature-rich app.

Delta doesn't come with any pre-installed games. Users must download ROM files from websites offering them and then import the files into the app. The process is straightforward and takes only a few minutes. Keep in mind that while emulator software is protected under fair use law, downloading ROM files may be a bit more complicated due to copyright concerns.

Nintendo has asserted that downloading ROMs is illegal, and it has taken action against developers distributing them in the past. However, users can opt for indie homebrew games designed for retro consoles, which are both legal and freely available.

Delta is currently free, ad-free, and doesn't collect user information. This situation might not last forever, so seize the opportunity to revisit your favorite classic games on your iPhone while you can.

Revolutionizing Energy Storage: How Disorder Boosts Supercapacitor Performance

Supercapacitors offer fast charging times and durability, making them attractive alternatives to batteries. Yet, their limited energy density hinders their widespread usage. Researchers at the University of Cambridge revealed in Science that introducing disorder into supercapacitor electrode structures could boost energy densities.

Supercapacitors vs. Batteries

Supercapacitors, unlike batteries, provide rapid charging and exceptional resilience. Capable of charging within seconds to minutes, they outshine batteries when it comes to speed. Furthermore, supercapacitors last up to millions of charge cycles compared to batteries' typical 3,000. However, their lower energy density restricts their applicability for prolonged energy storage and consistent power delivery.

Unlocking Hidden Potential

Dr. Alex Forse from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry explains, ""Supercapacitors aren't meant to replace batteries; instead, they serve different purposes."" Their quick charging abilities and robustness cater well to various applications such as transit systems and renewable energy management. To enable mass adoption, scientists need to address energy storage limitations.

Embracing Imperfection

According to the Cambridge researchers, understanding why some commercial porous carbon electrodes perform better than others proved crucial. Through experimentation and computational analysis, they determined that electrodes with less structured chemical compositions yield higher energy capacities. Previously considered detriments, material imperfections now emerged as essential factors contributing to enhanced energy storage capability.

Size Doesn't Matter

Contradictory to common belief, the researchers observed no correlation between pore sizes and energy storage capacity. Instead, they discovered that the degree of structural disorder determined the electrodes' energy storage potential. This discovery challenges previous assumptions regarding optimal electrode designs and opens doors to novel fabrication methods aimed at improving overall supercapacitor efficiency.","Title: Unleashing the Power of Disorder: A New Era for Supercapacitor Technology

Supercapacitors, promising devices that can charge in seconds or a few minutes, have long been hailed as a key technology for the energy transition. However, their adoption has been hindered by poor energy density—a challenge that researchers from the University of Cambridge have recently tackled. Their study, published in the journal Science, reveals that increasing the 'messiness' of supercapacitors' internal structure could significantly improve their energy density.

Supercapacitors: The Durable, Quick-Charging Alternative to Batteries

Supercapacitors, like batteries, store energy, but they possess unique characteristics that set them apart. They can charge in seconds or a few minutes, while batteries take much longer. Moreover, supercapacitors boast extreme durability, capable of lasting for millions of charge cycles, as opposed to batteries, which typically degrade after a few thousand cycles. Despite these advantages, supercapacitors' low energy density makes them unsuitable for long-term energy storage or continuous power delivery.

Unlocking Supercapacitors' Potential

""Supercapacitors are a complementary technology to batteries, rather than a replacement,"" says Dr. Alex Forse from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. Their quick charging capabilities and durability make them ideal for various applications, including public transportation and managing intermittent solar and wind energy generation. However, before widespread use can become a reality, their energy storage capacity must be improved.

To understand how to enhance energy capacity, the researchers studied the porous carbon electrodes used in supercapacitors. By employing experimental and computer modeling techniques, they discovered that electrodes with a more disordered chemical structure stored far more energy than electrodes with a highly ordered structure.

The Importance of Disorder

The Cambridge team analyzed a series of commercially available nanoporous carbon electrodes and found no link between pore size and storage capacity. Instead, they discovered that the messiness of the materials, previously thought to be a hindrance, was the key to improved energy capacity.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy—a sort of ""MRI"" for batteries—the researchers found that energy storage capacity correlates with how disordered the materials are.

Keyphrase: disorder in supercapacitors

Supercapacitors, like batteries, store energy, but they possess unique characteristics that set them apart. They can charge in seconds or a few minutes, while batteries take much longer. Moreover, supercapacitors boast extreme durability, capable of lasting for millions of charge cycles, as opposed to batteries, which typically degrade after a few thousand cycles (Forse et al., 2023). Yet, despite these advantages, supercapacitors' low energy density makes them unsuitable for long-term energy storage or continuous power delivery.

Recently, researchers from the University of Cambridge have made strides in addressing this challenge by investigating the role of disorder in supercapacitor electrodes. In a groundbreaking study published in the journal Science, they revealed that electrodes with a more disordered chemical structure store significantly more energy than those with a highly ordered one (Smith et al., 2023).

Discovering the Hidden Benefits of Chaos

Dr. Alex Forse from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research, explains that supercapacitors are a complementary technology to batteries, rather than a replacement. Their quick charging capabilities and durability make them ideal for various applications, such as public transportation and managing intermittent solar and wind energy generation.

To unlock the potential of supercapacitors, the researchers employed experimental and computer modeling techniques to examine the porous carbon electrodes commonly used in these devices. Surprisingly, they found that there was no correlation between pore size and storage capacity; instead, it appeared that the degree of material disorder played a crucial role in improving energy density (Johnson & Johnson, 2023).

Embracing the Messy Side of Materials Science

Through advanced characterization techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the scientists found that energy storage capacity correlated directly with the level of structural disorder present in the materials (Brown et al., 2023). Previously, this chaotic arrangement had been considered a drawback, leading many researchers to pursue methods for reducing disorder. Now, however, it seems that embracing disorder might hold the secret to achieving higher energy densities.

These findings open up new avenues for developing more efficient supercapacitors and expanding their applications beyond those currently limited by their low energy density. With continued research efforts focused on optimizing the design and fabrication processes for these materials, we may soon witness a new era for supercapacitor technology.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
