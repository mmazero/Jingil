Are you ready to chat with OpenAI's flagship conversational AI without an account? Starting today in a few markets and gradually rolling out to the rest of the world, visiting chat.openai.com will no longer ask you to log in. Instead, you'll be dropped right into conversation with ChatGPT, which will use the same model as logged-in users.

You can now chat to your heart's content, but be aware that you won't be getting quite the same set of features that folks with accounts are. You won't be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other stuff that generally has to be associated with a persistent account.

However, you still have the option to opt-out of your chats being used for training. Just click the tiny question mark in the lower right-hand side, then click ""settings,"" and disable the feature there. OpenAI offers this helpful gif:

This extra-free version of ChatGPT will have ""slightly more restrictive content policies."" What does that mean? I asked and got a wordy yet largely meaningless reply from a spokesperson:

The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience. We considered the potential ways in which a logged out service could be used in inappropriate ways, informed by our understanding of the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and risk assessments that we've completed.

So, really, no clue as to what exactly these more restrictive policies are. No doubt we will find out shortly as an avalanche of randos descends on the site to kick the tires on this new offering. ""We recognize that additional iteration may be needed and welcome feedback,"" the spokesperson said. And they shall receive it - in abundance!

To that point, I also asked whether they had any plan for how to handle what will almost certainly be attempts to abuse and weaponize the model on an unprecedented scale. Just think of it: a platform that causes a billionaire to lose money. After all, inference is still expensive, and even the refined, low-lift GPT-3.5 model takes power and server space. People are going to hammer it for all it's worth.

For this threat, they also had a non-answer: ""We've also carefully considered how we can detect and stop misuse of the signed out experience, and the teams responsible for detecting, preventing, and responding to abuse have been involved throughout the design and implementation of this experience and will continue to inform its design moving forward.""

Notice the lack of anything resembling concrete information. They probably have as little idea what people are going to subject this thing to as anyone else, and will have to be reactive rather than proactive.

It's not clear what areas or groups will get access to ultra-free ChatGPT first, but it's starting today, so check back regularly to find out if you're among the lucky ones.

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are a promising class of transistors, offering advantages like amplification and sensing capabilities, low driving voltages, and a versatile structure. A team from Northwestern University used electron-beam lithography (eBL) to create high-density, vertically organized OECT arrays, overcoming conventional OECT limitations. This eBL strategy results in p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays, enabling the creation of various vertically stacked logic circuits with stable switching properties.","Title: High-Density Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor Arrays: A New Era of Flexible and Stable Electronics

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are a promising class of transistors that can modulate electrical current in response to small changes in voltage. These transistors, based on organic semiconductors, have the potential to revolutionize brain-inspired and wearable technologies due to their unique advantages, such as amplification and sensing capabilities, low driving voltages, and a versatile structure. However, most conventional OECTs exhibit limitations, including stability issues and slow redox processes, which significantly impair their performance.

A team of researchers from Northwestern University, led by Jaehyun Kim and Robert M. Pankow, has developed a novel strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs, overcoming the limitations of conventional OECTs. Their approach, detailed in a paper published in Nature Electronics, involves using electron-beam lithography (eBL) to create high-density and vertically organized OECT arrays and circuits.

Electron-beam lithography (eBL) is a method of micropatterning organic semiconductors without using masks or chemical solvents. This strategy allows for the creation of ultra-small and high-density patterns while preserving well-defined conducting channel regions. Additionally, eBL enables the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits.

The eBL strategy converts the semiconductor-exposed area into an electronic insulator while retaining ionic conductivity and topological continuity with the redox-active unexposed areas. This process is essential for monolithic integration and results in p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays with transconductances of 0.08-1.7 S, transient times of less than 100 microseconds, and stable switching properties of more than 100,000 cycles.

To demonstrate the potential of their fabrication strategy, the researchers successfully created various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These circuits performed remarkably well and maintained excellent operational stability.

(This revised SEO title is 49 characters long and includes the main points of the article: Instagram, new feature, Blend, private Reels collaboration.)","Title: Unraveling Instagram's Potential New Feature: Blend

  

Recently, rumors have been swirling about a potential new feature called ""Blend"" making its way to Instagram. This innovative tool will allow users to create a private collection of Reels with a friend, curated through shared interests and mutual connections. Although still in its developmental stages, Blend has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with our favorite bite-sized video content on the platform. Let us delve deeper into what we know so far.

What Exactly Is Blend?
----------

As per a recent discovery made by mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, Blend appears to be an exclusive feature designed around Reels – those captivating 15-second videos accompanied by music and visual filters. In essence, Blend functions as a personalized feed containing Reels handpicked by both you and your chosen companion. It is essential to note that these collections remain hidden from prying eyes; only you and your designated partner possess access. Moreover, once either party decides to part ways, the corresponding Blend promptly dissolves.

The current state of Blend indicates that it remains firmly entrenched within Instagram's labs, devoid of external testing. However, if history serves as any indication, one cannot rule out the possibility of witnessing a full-fledged rollout sometime in the future. After all, Facebook – Instagram's parent company – is renowned for nurturing ideas internally before exposing them to the world.

Navigating the Landscape of Reels
------------------------------

For those who find themselves newly acquainted with Instagram, understanding the ins and outs of Reels is crucial. These miniature productions cater to users seeking brevity while maintaining entertainment value. By recording and uploading brief snippets capped at 15 seconds, individuals can engage their audiences using catchy tunes and visually appealing augmentations. When employing a private profile, dissemination occurs exclusively amongst approved followers. Conversely, opening oneself up to the broader community allows unrestricted viewing for every Instagram aficionado.

Accessing desired Reels requires merely locating the Reels icon within the iOS or Android application or webpage. Subsequently, glide left or right to savor each clip meticulously crafted by contributors worldwide. Utilizing the available tools adorning the screen, express approval via likes, add comments, propagate shares, or even isolate soundtracks from preferred creations.

Honing in on Personal Preferences
-------------------------------

So how does Instagram determine which Reels merit presentation upon your digital doorstep? Employing various strategies, the algorithm guides users toward material tailored to suit individual tastes. Amongst these tactics include propositions derived from similarities shared among followed accounts, prior engagements, and patterns gleaned from previous interactions. Furthermore, actions such as resharing, prolonged viewership, and investigative excursions to related pages bolster the likelihood of stumbling across comparable pieces moving forward.

Expansion and Competition
------------------------

Features analogous to Blend stand poised to amplify the exposure and appeal of Reels significantly. As competitors like TikTok vie for market dominance, innovations become paramount in securing user loyalty and attracting lucrative sponsorship agreements. Undoubtedly, implementing novel functionalities ranks high amongst priorities when attempting to maintain relevancy amidst ever-evolving landscapes.

Additionally, Instagram introduced multiple enhancements to Reels last November, further solidifying commitment towards improving user experience. Notably, sharers gained discretion over recipient selection, enabling targeted distribution rather than indiscriminate broadcasting. Additionally, creators benefited from heightened flexibility during the editing process, empowered with capabilities such as scaling, cropping, rotation manipulation, and revision control.

In summary, although details regarding Blend remain scarce, anticipation builds surrounding its impactful entry onto the scene. Leveraging collaborative efforts, Instagram continues pushing boundaries, providing compelling reasons for enthusiasts to linger longer within its expansive network.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-high-purity-cathode-materials-alternative.html,Are high-purity cathode materials truly necessary? An alternative to reduce secondary battery costs,"""Low-Purity Lithium Materials for Sustainable Battery Production: Challenging Conventional Wisdom""","

In the world of secondary battery technology, maintaining high purity standards for cathode materials is essential for ensuring consistent quality output, longevity, and eco-friendliness. However, a recent study published in Nature Communications has challenged the conventional wisdom that impurities in lithium materials hinder secondary battery performance.

The research team led by Professor Yong-Tae Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) discovered that the presence of approximately 1% magnesium (Mg) impurity in the lithium raw material actually enhances process efficiency and prolongs the lifespan of secondary batteries.

This study could potentially reduce the unit cost of batteries by up to 19.4% and carbon dioxide emissions by up to 9.0%, making batteries more sustainable and cost-effective.

The conventional assumption is that impurities in lithium materials hamper secondary battery performance, leading to the belief that lithium raw materials should have purity of at least 99.5%. However, the researchers found that low-purity lithium materials, not entirely rid of impurities, could still be used to manufacture cathode materials that perform exceptionally well.

Their experiments demonstrated that utilizing low-purity lithium materials led to increased process efficiency and prolonged secondary battery lifespan. This finding challenges the current belief that impurities in lithium materials are detrimental to secondary battery performance.

The study's implications could lead to a reevaluation of current cathode material specifications, making battery production more sustainable and cost-effective. Professor Kim stated, ""Secondary battery cell manufacturers need to reassess whether their current cathode material specifications are too stringent. Considering unconventional approaches could offer a fresh strategy against China's aggressively low prices.""

This research could have far-reaching implications in the battery industry, potentially leading to more cost-effective and sustainable batteries. As the world continues to grapple with the energy crisis, this study could pave the way for a more sustainable future.

In conclusion, the purity specifications for cathode materials set by cell manufacturers are often overly stringent, leading to increased costs and reduced sustainability. This study challenges this conventional wisdom, suggesting that low-purity lithium materials could still be used to manufacture cathode materials that perform exceptionally well. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential implications for the battery industry.

In the ever-evolving world of cloud computing, recent months have seen Amazon, Microsoft, and Google relax their egress fees. Egress fees, a type of tax charged by cloud companies for moving data to another vendor, function as a tool to retain existing customers. However, market dynamics have shifted, compelling these companies to reconsider their strategies.

The cloud infrastructure market has experienced increasing competition, leading Synergy Research's chief analyst, John Dinsdale, to comment, ""As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist."" This newfound focus on customer satisfaction is essential for success in today's IT landscape, where legacy companies resistant to change have struggled.

A multi-cloud world is emerging, and the importance of seamless data migration cannot be overstated. Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder of Bobsled, a startup that facilitates data migration between clouds, explains, ""Going across [cloud platforms] was really challenging... enterprise customers are saying that there is no world in which a global enterprise is not using multiple platforms."" These egress fees create significant barriers to data migration, making it difficult to share information between customers and even within divisions of the same company.

Regulatory pressure has also played a role in this shift. Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, points out, ""Google has used [the absence of egress fees] as a marketing tool against Azure... If these companies see the demise of egress fees as an inevitability, then Google certainly has first-mover advantage towards painting itself as the ‘less restrictive’ cloud and attracting early-stage customers.""

However, not everyone is convinced that this change will significantly impact cloud customers. David Linthicum, a longtime cloud consultant, cautions, ""Customers have to consider the costs holistically... there are networking fees, the egress fees, all the other hidden fees that come along with what people call junk fees that come from the cloud vendors.""

Startups may not feel the impact as profoundly as larger enterprise customers. Seseri explains, ""The experience of startups will certainly improve as providers now must lean further into innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738",2024-03-31 16:00:41,"Meta Description: Google Leads Major Cloud Providers in Eliminating Data Egress Fees - Boost competition, reduce costs.

The city of Torreón will also get to experience the total eclipse, which will start at around 12:09 PM MDT (total eclipse starting at 1:09 PM CDT). The total eclipse will move into the US at 12:10 PM CDT (Eagle Pass, Texas), and will pass through Austin, Fort Worth, and Dallas, which are among the most populous cities in Texas.

The total eclipse will then move into Little Rock, Arkansas, and select parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, including Indianapolis. In Ohio, cities such as Dayton, Toledo, and Cleveland will get to experience the full show. In Pennsylvania, Erie, Pennsylvania, Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse will also get to see the solar eclipse.

Canada will also get to experience the Great American Solar Eclipse, with parts of southern Ontario (Hamilton, Niagara Falls) and Quebec (Montreal) getting to witness the totality. Additionally, New Brunswick, PEI, and Bonavista, Labrador, will experience totality at around 4:03 PM NDT (Newfoundland Time).

If you're elsewhere on the continent and can't travel, you can still see the solar eclipse by checking the map that shows how much of the eclipse you'll get depending on where you are on the continent. An impressive list of major centers is within 200 miles of totality, so they'll get a 90% or better eclipse, including Houston, St. Louis, Memphis, Nashville, Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Toronto, New York, Boston, and many more.

What's the weather forecast in my area?

Unfortunately, the odds of precipitation are above average across most of the band of the solar eclipse, with forecasts predicting that the chances for clear skies are better the farther northeast you live, the opposite of historical trends. Weather forecasts predict that Dallas will have showers throughout the day (58%), which would mean continuous cloud cover and no clear view if that holds. However, forecasts predict that Montreal will have mostly sunny skies with only a 9% chance of rain, and Fredericton, New Brunswick, will also have mostly sunny skies with only a 11% chance of rain.

How can I watch the solar eclipse at home?

When it comes to watching the solar eclipse, it's important to remember that staring at the sun can cause serious eye damage. It's crucial to use protective eyewear, such as eclipse glasses or a pinhole camera, to safely view the solar eclipse.

If you don't have access to protective eyewear, there are other ways to safely watch the solar eclipse. For example, you can watch the solar eclipse on television, using a live streaming service to view the event in real-time. Additionally, you can also download an app on your smartphone or tablet that allows you to view the solar eclipse using your device's camera.

In conclusion, the Great American Solar Eclipse is an exciting event that will darken parts of the US, Canada, and Mexico on April 8th. While the duration of totality is brief, it's still an incredible sight to behold.

People thought it was Google's April Fool's Day joke, The Genesis of Gmail: How Google's Groundbreaking Email Service Revolutionized the World of Email Management ,"Title: The Genesis of Gmail: A Fascinating Tale of Innovation and April Fool's Day Pranks

The world of technology is rife with groundbreaking inventions and revolutionary ideas. However, not all of them can claim the same level of impact as Google's Gmail, which was unveiled on April Fool's Day 20 years ago. This email service, with its 1 gigabyte of free storage per account, seemed like an impossible dream in an era of one-terabyte iPhones, but it quickly changed the way people viewed email storage and management.

In this article, we will delve into the fascinating story behind Gmail's creation, its initial success, and how it has evolved over time. We will also explore the role of pranks in Google's corporate culture and how they contributed to the development of this revolutionary email service.

The Beginning: A Mind-Bending Concept

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were known for their sense of humor and their love for pulling pranks. They began incorporating their playful spirit into the company's products, and their April Fool's Day jokes became a tradition. But they had something even more mind-bending planned for April Fool's Day 2004.

Larry Page, then just 31 years old, had a vision for an email service that would offer unprecedented storage capacity, search functionality, and speed. This vision was the genesis of Gmail, a service that would revolutionize the way people manage their emails and personal information.

The original pitch for Gmail was focused on three key aspects: storage, search, and speed. The service offered a groundbreaking 1 gigabyte of free storage per account, compared to the 30 to 60 emails offered by leading webmail services like Yahoo and Microsoft at the time. Gmail's search functionality was also unique, allowing users to quickly retrieve information from old emails, photos, and other personal data stored on the service.

But perhaps the most innovative aspect of Gmail was its threading feature, which automatically organized communication about the same topic into a single thread. This made it much easier for users to keep track of conversations and find the information they needed.

The Prank that Changed Everything

Google's decision to unveil Gmail on April Fool's Day 2004 was a strategic move, as it allowed them to generate buzz and excitement about the service while keeping people's expectations low. However, it also created a sense of suspense and intrigue, as many people wondered whether Google was really serious about this seemingly impossible email service.

When the Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on the afternoon of April Fool's Day 2004, readers were initially skeptical. But as word spread about the service, more and more people began to take Gmail seriously.

The service quickly gained traction, and within a few months, Gmail had already become one of the most popular email services on the market. Its unique features and user-friendly interface made it a favorite among tech enthusiasts and casual users alike.

The Evolution of Gmail

Over the years, Gmail has continued to evolve and improve, incorporating new features and improving upon its existing ones. In 2005, Google introduced its POP3 and IMAP email services, allowing users to access their emails from other email clients and devices.

In 2009, Google introduced Google Chat, a real-time instant messaging service that allowed users to communicate with each other in real-time. This service was later integrated into Google Meet, a video conferencing platform that has become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2012, Google introduced Google Drive, a cloud-based storage service that allowed users to store and access their files from anywhere in the world. This service has since become an integral part of Gmail, offering users an additional 15 gigabytes of free storage when they sign up for a Gmail account.

In recent years, Google has continued to improve Gmail's search functionality, introducing new features such as smart replies, which suggest email responses based on the content of the email. The service has also become more integrated with other Google products, such as Google Photos and Google Drive.

The Role of Pranks in Google's Corporate Culture

Google's love for pranks has been a part of the company's culture since its inception. Pranks have been used as a way to build camaraderie, generate buzz, and",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/gmail-revolutionized-e.jpg,2024-03-31 06:31:14,"Title: The Revolutionary Email Service: Gmail Turns 20

In 2004, Google introduced its groundbreaking email service, Gmail, which quickly revolutionized the way people manage their emails and personal information. Over the past 20 years, the service has evolved and improved, offering users an unparalleled email experience.

One of Gmail's key features is its 1 gigabyte of free storage per account, which was a game-changer in an era of limited email storage. Gmail's search functionality is also unique, allowing users to quickly retrieve information from old emails, photos, and other personal data stored on the service.

Over the years, Gmail has continued to evolve and improve, incorporating new features and improving upon its existing ones. It has become more integrated with other Google products, such as Google Drive, and its search functionality has become more advanced, with features such as smart replies.

Google's love for pranks has also played a significant role in the development and success of Gmail. The company's April Fool's Day jokes have become a tradition, and Gmail's launch on that day was no exception. In fact, the initial success of Gmail can be attributed to the buzz and excitement it generated on April Fool's Day.

In conclusion, Gmail has revolutionized the way people manage their emails and personal information, and its success can be attributed to its unique features, user-friendly interface, and Google's love for pranks. The service continues to evolve and improve, and it remains a favorite among users worldwide.

In the wake of rising tensions between the US and China, GGV Capital, a prominent cross-border venture capital firm, decided to part ways with its U.S. and Asian operations earlier this year. Recently, the two entities revealed their new identities: Granite Asia, headed by Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo in Singapore, and Notable Capital, managed by Hans Tung and other investors in the United States. This article delves deeper into these changes and introduces the key players and focuses of the newly formed firms.

Granite Asia: A New Chapter Led by Veteran Investors

Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo, both natives of Singapore, spearhead Granite Asia following the separation from GGV Capital. With a strong track record, Lee graces Forbes' Midas List of leading VCs every year. She boasts nine successful Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in the past half-decade, among them Xiaomi and Kingsoft WPS, two giants in the smartphone and software industries.

Meanwhile, Foo served as GGV Capital's global managing director before taking charge of Granite Asia. His accomplishments comprise investments in Xpeng Motors, Didi Chuxing, and Grab, all of which made significant strides in the electric vehicle, ride-hailing, and delivery sectors. Under his leadership, Granite Asia aims to support startups in China, Japan, South Asia, Australia, and Southeast Asia.

Notable Capital: Continued Growth Across Multiple Regions

On the opposite side of the globe, Hans Tung leads Notable Capital alongside fellow American investors Jeff Richards and Glenn Solomon. Based in Menlo Park, California, the trio maintains GGV Capital's legacy of fostering innovation across various markets. Their portfolio spans renowned names like Airbnb, StockX, and Slack in addition to emerging businesses targeting cryptocurrency, logistics, and cybersecurity opportunities.

Newcomers to Notable Capital include Oren Yunger, previously an investor at GGV Capital. Joining the firm in 2018, he quickly ascended to managing director last autumn. Despite the shift, one constant remains: Eric Xu, stationed in Shanghai, continues supervising GGV Capital's yuan-denominated funds independently.

Post-Split Asset Distribution

At the end of 2019, GGV Capital declared raising $2.5 billion for its latest set of funds—its most substantial pool ever. Following the division, each entity received proportional parts of the total assets under management, amounting to approximately $5 billion for Granite Asia and $4.2 billion for Notable Capital. These resources enable both organizations to maintain robust portfolios and pursue impactful ventures worldwide.

With new horizons ahead, Granite Asia and Notable Capital carry forth the successes of GGV Capital while cultivating unique presences in the competitive landscape. Both entities remain committed to empowering entrepreneurs and bolstering groundbreaking ideas in today's rapidly evolving business environment.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-31-at-11.17.49-AM.png?resize=1200,793",2024-04-01 05:46:34,"Discover how GGV Capital split created Granite Asia & Notable Capital!

Introduction

A significant shift is underway in the world of mobile applications, particularly for iPhone users. The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to break Apple's hold on the App Store ecosystem, fostering a competitive landscape where various app stores can thrive. One such player eagerly awaiting this opportunity is AltStore, an innovative app store concept developed by Riley Testut. Let's delve deeper into how AltStore intends to revolutionize app distribution and monetization in the EU.

Capitalizing on Opportunities Presented by the DMA

With the advent of the DMA, Apple has been compelled to introduce Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and frameworks that enable developers to distribute apps independently of the App Store. Seizing this chance, AltStore swiftly announced its intention to launch a revamped version of its app marketplace tailored explicitly for the EU. In contrast to existing models reliant on ads, paid downloads, or in-app purchases, AltStore introduces a novel approach – integrating with Patreon, allowing developers to promote their creations directly to end-users.

Unique Business Model & Monetization Strategy

AltStore's upcoming release boasts an intriguing subscription model reminiscent of Apple's in-app subscriptions yet devoid of the conventional 15%-30% commission fees imposed by Apple. Instead, alternative app stores may choose to pay €0.50 annually per installation exceeding one million, dubbed ""Core Technology Fee."" However, uncertainty surrounds whether Apple will retain this fee due to ongoing EU antitrust scrutiny.

Upon successful deployment, AltStore envisions facilitating third-party developers to disseminate their applications through the platform by setting up individual sources. These creators can leverage the very same Patreon integration employed by AltStore to offer 'premium' apps. Consequently, this arrangement paves the way for inventive app monetization strategies previously unimaginable under Apple's stringent guidelines.

Empowering Developers & Enhancing User Experience

By embracing AltStore, developers gain access to a simplified method for distributing and monetizing their apps beyond Apple's limitations. Moreover, users benefit immensely from enhanced transparency regarding app permissions prior to installation, ensuring informed decisions.

Notably, the EU version of AltStore promises considerable ease-of-use, eliminating the need for cumbersome procedures associated with side-loading apps today. Users no longer require a computer nor must they share sensitive information such as their Apple ID and password. Furthermore, seamless navigation characterizes the UI, bearing striking resemblance to contemporary app stores while adhering to necessary disclosures mandated by Apple.

Conclusion

Undoubtedly, the EU's Digital Markets Act heralds transformative potential for app distribution channels, bolstered by pioneers like AltStore. By harnessing Patreon integration and promoting transparent communication between developers and users, AltStore sets itself apart as an appealing alternative to established platforms. Ultimately, this development sparks curiosity around future possibilities in a rapidly evolving digital era.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/altstore.png?resize=1200,490",2024-04-01 16:54:25,"Discover AltStore: The Revolutionary App Store Integrating with Patreon, Coming Soon to the EU!
