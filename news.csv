Artisan coffee roastery Kaffa, based in Helsinki, Finland, has unveiled an innovative coffee blend developed by artificial intelligence. This pioneering initiative combines technology and tradition in a sector that typically cherishes manual work.

Finland, a nation of 5.6 million, leads the world in coffee consumption, with an annual rate of 12 kilograms per capita, according to the International Coffee Organization. Thus, it's fitting that Kaffa's ""AI-conic"" blend was launched in this Nordic coffee haven. This unique blend is the result of a partnership between Kaffa and local AI consultancy, Elev.

The AI-conic blend consists of a meticulously selected assortment of beans, dominated by the velvety Fazenda Pinhal variety from Brazil. Elev's AI, akin to models such as ChatGPT and Copilot, crafted this distinctive blend to cater to coffee enthusiasts' tastes, pushing the boundaries of conventional flavor combinations.

Svante Hampf, Kaffa's managing director and founder, shared with The Associated Press that the goal of the partnership was to explore the potential of AI in coffee roasting, an age-old artisan profession deeply respected in Finland. The team fed the AI descriptions of their coffee types and flavors, instructing it to create a new exciting blend.

In addition to carefully selecting the beans, the AI also designed the coffee package label and crafted a detailed taste description for the AI-conic blend: ""a well-balanced blend of sweetness and ripe fruit."" Hampf admitted he was surprised that the AI chose to merge four different types of coffee beans, rather than the usual two or three, which allows for more distinct flavor differentiation.

After the initial test roasting and blind tasting, Kaffa's coffee experts agreed that the AI-assisted blend was perfect, requiring no human adjustments. Elev's spokesman, Antti Merilehto, described the blend as ""a tangible example of how AI can introduce new perspectives to seasoned professionals"" and provide coffee lovers with novel taste experiences.

Introduction

Raising children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) can be a challenging journey for parents. The struggle to access professional help, coupled with the high cost of treatment, further complicates the situation. However, a chronic care startup named Clarity Pediatrics is transforming the landscape of ADHD diagnosis and therapy for young children and their families.

The Problem: Long Wait Times and High Costs

Parents often face long wait times, sometimes up to a year, to get their children diagnosed and treated for ADHD. The shortage of psychologists nationwide and the high cost of out-of-network care, which can amount to thousands of dollars per year, only add to the problem.

Clarity Pediatrics: A Solution in Sight

Clarity Pediatrics, founded in 2021, addresses these issues by reducing wait times for a diagnosis and beginning therapy from many months to a mere couple of days, all for an average $15 co-pay per session. The startup's innovative approach focuses on eight-week group therapy sessions for parents of newly or previously diagnosed children instead of individual therapy for kids.

Behavioral Parent Training: A Recommended Approach

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) for families of children aged five to 12 with mild-to-moderate ADHD. Clarity Pediatrics adopts this approach, teaching parents strategies and skills to help their children focus in school and manage emotional outbursts. BPT is more effective for young kids with ADHD than one-to-one therapy, according to Christina LaMontagne, Clarity's CEO and co-founder.

Expanding Services and Addressing Other Chronic Conditions

Over the past 18 months, Clarity Pediatrics has provided online care to thousands of families in California. With a $10 million seed fund from Rethink Impact, Homebrew, and Maverick Ventures, the startup plans to expand its services to other states in 2024. In the future, Clarity Pediatrics aims to offer healthcare for other low-complexity pediatric chronic conditions like asthma, allergies, and obesity.

The European Union (EU) has opened a second formal investigation into the video-sharing platform TikTok, suspecting it of violating the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA). This move comes after the EU announced an ongoing investigation into TikTok's DSA compliance in February. The latest probe focuses on TikTok Lite, a version of the app launched in France and Spain, which features a 'task and reward' system that could negatively impact users' mental health, particularly minors.

The EU's concern revolves around the 'task and reward' feature, which allows users to earn points for watching or liking videos, which can then be exchanged for rewards like Amazon gift vouchers or TikTok's digital currency. The Commission fears this mechanism could stimulate addictive behavior, leading to potential mental health issues. 

The EU has given TikTok until April 24 to argue against the measure, which could force the company to suspend access to TikTok Lite in the EU. The social media giant is regulated under the strictest regime of the DSA, which applies to around half a dozen larger platforms. This regulation requires these platforms to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks, such as addictive design that could harm users' mental health.

The EU's suspicion is that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, failed to conduct and submit a risk assessment report prior to the launch of the 'Task and Reward Lite' program. The Commission has not yet confirmed any breaches of the DSA, but penalties for confirmed violations can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover, which could result in hefty fines for ByteDance.

TikTok has not yet responded to the EU's latest DSA enforcement. However, the EU's press release raises specific concerns about the 'suspected absence of effective age verification mechanisms on TikTok'.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-your-new-it-superhero-citizen-developers-flex-their-ai-muscles/,Meet your new IT superhero: Citizen developers flex their AI muscles, Citizen Developers: The New IT Superheroes Boosting Tech Initiatives Success ,"[INTRODUCTION]
In today's digital age, a fascinating shift has taken place: IT professionals are becoming business-savvy, and business professionals are developing a stronger understanding of technology. This convergence has led to the rise of a new breed of professionals - the citizen developers. This article delves into the concept of citizen developers, their role in bridging the gap between technology and business, and the impact they have on the success rates of technology initiatives.

[THE RISE OF CITIZEN DEVELOPERS]
Coined by Tom Davenport and Ian Barkin, the term ""citizen developers"" refers to professionals who possess a deep understanding of both business challenges and available technologies. As Davenport explains, ""They know what the problems are in the supply chain and they know something about how technology can help to make them better."" This unique blend of expertise allows them to create effective solutions that genuinely address business needs.

The increasing number of citizen developers has resulted in a significant overlap between IT and business professionals' skill sets. Barkin notes, ""Ultimately, this is going to mean higher success rates for technology initiatives. Traditionally IT projects have a very high failure rate. It's because there is a lack of overlap between domain expertise and knowing what it is that you're trying to actually solve and understanding the tools you're trying to solve it with.""

This overlap is attributed to two primary factors: first, humans are becoming more technically inclined, with most people using technology daily through mobile phones and laptops. Second, technology is becoming more user-friendly and human-oriented, featuring natural language processing and point-and-click interfaces.

[GUARDRAILS FOR CITIZEN DEVELOPERS]
While citizen developers bring immense value to the table, they should not be responsible for tasks such as designing enterprise architecture, planning, or maintaining infrastructure requirements. These tasks require the expertise of seasoned software professionals who can provide guidance, strategic planning, and ensure the viability of business technology.

To ensure citizen developers work effectively, companies should implement ""guardrails"" within their systems. These guardrails consist of standards, security protocols, and scorecards that make it easy for citizen developers to do the right thing. By establishing clear ownership and handoff rules, organizations can prevent documentation and responsibility gaps when employees leave.

[ADDRESSING THE SKILL GAP]

The study encourages HRI researchers to consider the sociological aspects of human-robot interactions to develop more socially-aware robots.","Title: The Sociological Side of Social Robots: A New Perspective on Human-Robot Interaction

Introduction

In the realm of human-robot interaction (HRI), researchers have traditionally focused on design features of social robots, overlooking crucial sociological factors. However, a groundbreaking study by Cornell and Indiana University scholars specializing in HRI highlights the importance of understanding the broader social contexts, communities, and cultural norms that shape our interactions with social robots.

The Value of Sociological Contexts

Malte Jung, an associate professor of information science at Cornell University, emphasizes that understanding sociality in robot interaction goes beyond programming robots to respond to human social cues. Instead, it involves examining the social contexts, human-to-human interactions, and cultural norms that contribute to making a robot ""social.""

In a recent study, Waki Kamino, a doctoral student in the field of information science at Cornell, explored Tokyo's robot-friendly culture to understand how people interact with social robots and integrate them into their daily lives. Through extensive fieldwork, Kamino discovered that in Japan, manufacturers and robot owners collaborate to establish new norms for robots as social agents.

Robots as Social Catalysts

In Tokyo, social robots like Sony's Aibo, SHARP's RoBoHoN, and Groove X's LOVOT have created expansive communities of like-minded owners who regularly socialize and host events involving their robots. These robots have become part of their owners' social rituals, from attending coffee dates to throwing birthday parties.

Kamino's research reveals that these robot owners have rich social connections, often facilitated by the robots themselves. This contradicts the common perception of robot owners as isolated or eccentric individuals. Instead, they form a tight-knit community that interacts and engages in shared social practices.

Robots as Emotional Support Systems

Interestingly, Kamino also found that robots provide emotional support to their owners. For instance, some people prefer robots over living pets due to the lower emotional risk, while others rely on robots as companions during difficult times, such as during hospitalization.

A significant vulnerability has been discovered in a smart access control system used by thousands of U.S. rental homes, and the company responsible for it has yet to address the issue. The Chirp Systems' smart lock system, adopted by numerous rental properties, contains a flaw that allows unauthorized individuals to remotely control any lock connected to the system. This exposes residents to an alarming risk of unlawful entry. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a security advisory regarding the issue, but Chirp Systems has not responded to requests for a fix. This article will delve into the details of the vulnerability and the negligence of the company, potentially endangering countless residents.

[THE VULNERABILITY]
The Chirp Systems' smart lock system relies on phone apps that residents use instead of keys to access their homes. However, the apps' design stores hardcoded credentials in their source code, which is a well-known security risk. Hardcoding credentials poses a severe threat because anyone can extract and use them to perform actions impersonating the app. In this case, the credentials enable unauthorized individuals to remotely lock or unlock Chirp-connected door locks over the internet.

CISA has classified the vulnerability with a severity score of 9.1 out of 10, highlighting its ease of exploitation and the potential for remote attacks. Successful exploitation could grant an attacker unrestricted physical access to smart locks connected to a Chirp smart home system.

(This SEO title is succinct, informative, and adheres to the 50-character limit. It covers the main points of the article and incorporates relevant keywords for search engine optimization.)","Title: Informatica and Salesforce: A Potential Acquisition That Never Was

The technology industry is no stranger to mergers and acquisitions, with rumors often sparking excitement and speculation. Recently, the tech world was abuzz with the possibility of Salesforce acquiring Informatica. However, this potential deal quickly fizzled out, with Informatica releasing an official statement to confirm that it was not for sale.

Informatica's Official Statement

On Monday, Informatica released an official press release addressing the rumors, stating that it was not engaged in any acquisition discussions. This announcement came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Informatica was in advanced talks to be acquired. It is uncommon for companies to publicly address market rumors; however, Informatica's decision to clarify its position highlights its commitment to its current strategy and independence.

Why the Informatica-Salesforce Acquisition Didn't Make Sense

According to Constellation's Ray Wang, the acquisition didn't make much sense from the start. Although Informatica's data integration capabilities could potentially address some of Salesforce's challenges, Salesforce's Data Cloud is already a robust offering. Moreover, Informatica's technology may not be considered cutting-edge, and its client base doesn't necessarily align with Salesforce's target market.

Salesforce's Traditional Response to Rumors and Speculation

True to form, Salesforce declined to comment on the rumors, adhering to its longstanding policy of not addressing market speculation. In the absence of official confirmation, the tech community was left to analyze and debate the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a deal.

The Aftermath: Informatica's Focus on Its Current Strategy

Following the dismissal of the acquisition rumors, Informatica can now refocus on its current strategy and growth initiatives. The company's decision to publicly address the rumors underscores its dedication to its independent growth and development.

In conclusion, the Informatica-Salesforce acquisition rumor proved to be just that - a rumor. With Informatica's official denial, the tech community can now shift its focus to more substantiated developments and industry trends. Nevertheless, the initial excitement surrounding the potential acquisition serves as a reminder of the ever-evolving","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1355959712.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-04-22 15:59:10,"""Informatica denies acquisition talks, reaffirming commitment to independence.

In the modern world, connectivity has become a crucial aspect of our daily lives. With the proliferation of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, people expect to have access to Wi-Fi in various public and private spaces. However, wireless local-area networks (WLANs) based on IEEE802.11 standards often face performance issues due to factors like user transmission rates and interference.

A team of researchers, including Associate Professor Sumiko Miyata from Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT), have developed a novel solution to improve Wi-Fi performance using game theory. The team's paper, published in the IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society, presents a new access point (AP) connection method designed to enhance system throughput by considering user position and inter-user interference.

Game theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on decision-making within well-defined frameworks. The researchers employed a potential game model to determine the user position that maximizes system throughput. This model combines the incentives for all users into a single function, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of user positions and their impact on existing users and inter-user interference.

The team compared their proposed AP connection strategy with previous methods in various scenarios. The results demonstrated that their strategy consistently improved AP throughput, with enhancements reaching up to 6% in some cases. While prompting users to move may not be feasible in all situations, this approach could be beneficial in certain environments, such as classrooms and libraries.

In these settings, the Wi-Fi system would calculate the optimal user positions based on their locations to increase overall throughput. Users, motivated by their desire to boost their individual throughput, would be encouraged to take cooperative action.

This study's findings are significant given the increasing number of Wi-Fi-enabled devices in contemporary society. Implementing efficient AP systems is essential for realizing smart cities, where seamless connectivity is a fundamental component. The game theory-based approach offers a promising solution to optimize Wi-Fi performance and network resource usage, paving the way for a more connected world.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-winwin-approach-maxi.jpg,2024-04-22 15:57:43,"""Optimize Wi-Fi performance with game theory in smart cities.

Introduction

The Linux kernel, the heart of the Linux operating system, is constantly evolving, with new releases and updates being made regularly. To stay updated on the latest developments, subscribing to the Linux Kernel Mailing List or Linux Weekly News (LWN) is recommended. However, for a broad, quick overview of the state of the Linux kernel, attending a state-of-the-kernel presentation, such as the one given by Jonathan Corbet, Linux kernel developer and LWN editor-in-chief, is invaluable.

The Calm before the Storm

At the Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, Corbet reported that everything is ""calm and steady and boring"" with the next kernel, Linux 6.9. This is good news, as it indicates that the kernel is stable and free from major issues. However, Corbet also warned of some concerning news regarding the security of the Linux kernel.

Kernel Vulnerabilities

According to Corbet, any bug in the kernel has the potential to become a vulnerability. This is because the kernel occupies a unique spot in the system and turns many ordinary bugs into vulnerabilities. To address this issue, Linux kernel developers have started issuing their own Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) notifications. As a result, there are now hundreds of Linux kernel CVEs, with 800 new assigned CVEs since February alone.

Ensuring the Safety and Security of Linux Systems

To ensure the safety and security of Linux systems, Corbet recommended running long-term stable (LTS) kernel releases. These releases have fixed CVEs, and as new issues are patched, they're ported into the LTS kernels. However, it should be noted that LTS releases are now supported for only two years, not six.
