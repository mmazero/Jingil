In our increasingly digital world, electronic devices are becoming more complex, boasting an ever-growing array of functions. While this complexity offers numerous benefits, it can also lead to performance and safety issues, such as device overheating and microwave emissions, which can negatively impact performance and potentially pose health risks. To tackle these challenges, a team of Chinese scientists from Beijing Normal University has developed a groundbreaking solution: bionic, multifunctional composite phase change materials (PCMs) designed to enhance thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption in electronic devices.

PCMs are engineered materials that combine various elements to create new substances with specific, purpose-driven characteristics. In this study, the researchers focused on improving thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption to optimize electronic device performance and safety. Inspired by biological systems, the team created a neural network-like aerogel to boost efficiency in these areas.

Xiao Chen, a researcher at the Institute of Advanced Materials at Beijing Normal University, explained, ""Our developed functionally integrated composite PCMs provide a prospective application of highly integrated and miniaturized electronic devices in complex and changeable outdoor environments.""

To ensure the desired properties, the researchers carefully selected the elements for their new aerogel shield. They aimed to improve thermal management, optimizing heat dissipation and heat storage; enhance solar-thermal conversion, allowing devices to heat up for normal start-up in cold environments; and absorb microwave emissions.

The researchers recognized that ""thermally enhanced PCMs have the ability to store and release massive energy as latent heat, making them widely acknowledged for the ability to ensure precise temperature control."" By incorporating PCMs that undergo phase change as the temperature increases, they could enhance heat storage and dissipation. When the temperature cools, the liquid reverts to solid, releasing the stored heat.

However, while pure PCMs are not ideal for solar-thermal conversion, the team found that bacterial cellulose (BC) is a promising natural biomass material for this purpose. BC-derived carbon nanofiber, produced through high-temperature carbonization, has excellent solar-thermal conversion capabilities.

Introduction

In a significant breakthrough, researchers have discovered a method to dramatically enhance the efficiency of sustainable fuel generation. By cleverly manipulating the crystalline structure of low-cost, abundant, and eco-friendly materials, they have achieved a remarkable 70% improvement in the conversion of water into hydrogen fuel using sunlight. This development brings us one step closer to a sustainable future, powered by clean and storable fuels compatible with existing energy infrastructure.

The Challenge of Oxide Semiconductors

Copper (I) oxide, or cuprous oxide, has been considered a potential low-cost alternative to silicon for solar cells. While reasonably effective at capturing sunlight and converting it into electric charge, much of this charge is lost, limiting the material's performance. The issue lies in the mismatch between how deeply light is absorbed and how far charges travel within the material.

A Matter of Crystal Orientation

Researchers from the University of Cambridge found that the orientation of copper oxide crystals plays a crucial role in the movement of electric charges. By growing the copper oxide crystals in a specific orientation, the electric charges move faster and further, significantly improving performance. The team grew high-quality cuprous oxide films at ambient pressure and room temperature, controlling growth and flow rates to 'shift' the crystals into a particular orientation.

The Magic of Diagonal Movement

High temporal resolution spectroscopic techniques revealed that electrons moved an order of magnitude further when traveling through the cube at a body diagonal, rather than along the face or edge of the cube. This diagonal direction resulted in a massive performance boost of over 70% compared to existing state-of-the-art electrodeposited oxide photocathodes.

Stability and the Future of Clean Energy

Beyond performance, the orientation also resulted in increased stability. While much more research and development are needed, this and related families of materials have the potential to play a vital role in the energy transition.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University are paving the way for a new era of immersive displays, combining the real and virtual worlds in an ordinary pair of eyeglasses using high-definition 3D holographic images (Heide et al., 2024). Holographic images have a significant advantage over traditional monitors because they are three-dimensional, allowing for seamless integration into our natural field of vision.

The potential of such technology is immense, providing a truly immersive experience in which users can move their heads without losing sight of the holographic images. This innovation could revolutionize various aspects of our lives, from offering driving directions to enhancing patient monitoring during surgeries, and even assisting with home repairs.

A significant hurdle in realizing holographic displays has been the quality of the images produced. Holographic images are created using spatial light modulators, which, until now, could only generate either small, clear, or large, but fuzzy images. This tradeoff has limited the field of view and prevented an immersive user experience. As Matsuda, a research scientist at Meta and co-author of the study, explains, ""If you look towards the corners of the display, the whole image may disappear"" (Heide et al., 2024).

To tackle this issue, Heide, Matsuda, and Tseng, a doctoral student in computer science, collaborated to create a device that could enhance image quality and expand the field of view. They engineered a second optical element that works in conjunction with the spatial light modulator, filtering the light to expand the field of view while preserving the image's stability and fidelity. This new optical element, resembling a small piece of custom-built frosted glass, scatters light in a precise manner, improving the quality of the holographic image and enhancing the overall user experience.

Despite the progress made in this research, there are still challenges to overcome before holographic displays become a reality. Image quality remains an issue, as well as the fabrication process for the optical elements. Nevertheless, Heide is optimistic, stating, ""This research shows a path forward",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/holographic-displays-o-1.jpg,2024-04-23 12:23:16,"""Discover holographic displays advancements: 3D images in ordinary eyeglasses.

Introduction

In the world of video gaming, there's a unique group of individuals who have mastered the art of exploiting glitches to complete games in record time. These gamers, known as ""speedrunners,"" can quickly finish games by taking advantage of their malfunctions. A study conducted by students at the University of Bristol reveals that the techniques used by these speedrunners can provide valuable insights to software engineers, helping them develop more robust applications.

Unraveling the Glitches in Classic Super Mario Games

To understand the glitches exploited by speedrunners, the researchers examined four classic Super Mario platforming games: Super Mario Bros (1985), Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988), Super Mario World (1990), and Super Mario 64 (1996). These games, despite their age, are still competitively run by speedrunners, with new records reported regularly. The researchers analyzed 237 known glitches within these games, classifying various weaknesses to determine if they share similarities with bugs in conventional software.

The Super Mario platforming games require players to navigate an obstacle course of platforms, avoid enemies, and collect power-ups to rescue Princess Peach. These games, developed for consoles with limited hardware capabilities, rely on aggressive optimization and unique programming techniques that can sometimes lead to bugs. By studying these glitches, researchers can identify new categories of weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which can help software developers create more efficient and reliable applications.

The Challenges of Programming for Early Gaming Systems

Programming for early gaming systems presents unique challenges due to their limited hardware capabilities. Dr. Joseph Hallett from Bristol's School of Computer Science explained that aggressive optimization and unconventional programming techniques are often required to make games run well on these systems. These techniques, while effective, can lead to bugs that are not typically encountered in modern software development.

By categorizing and studying these bugs, software engineers can better understand and address similar problems in more general software. The University of Bristol research team identified seven new categories of weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which were previously unspecified in existing software defect taxonomies.

The Intersection of Speedrunning and Software Engineering

The study of speed",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/super-mario.jpg,2024-04-23 16:10:05,"running and its impact on software engineering is a promising new avenue for research, offering valuable insights into the world of coding and application development. By analyzing the techniques used by Super Mario speedrunners, developers can introduce new optimization strategies, resulting in more efficient and secure software.

For instance, one category of weakness identified in the study is ""conditional branches,"" which involve decisions based on specific conditions. These branches can cause unpredictable behavior in both games and software when manipulated. By understanding how speedrunners exploit this weakness, developers can implement better error handling and improve the overall reliability of their applications.

The research also highlights the importance of stress-testing software and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities. Speedrunners often discover glitches that have gone unnoticed during regular gameplay, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing and debugging.

Moreover, the study of speedrunning can inspire developers to find innovative solutions for common bugs. By analyzing the unconventional methods used by speedrunners, developers can approach problem-solving in unique and creative ways, leading to more robust and efficient applications.

In conclusion, the intersection of speedrunning and software engineering provides valuable insights for developers, helping them create more efficient, reliable, and secure applications. As speedrunning continues to grow in popularity, its influence on the software industry is likely to expand, leading to better software development practices and improved user experiences.

Grid-scale energy storage systems, such as flow batteries, have become increasingly important in our pursuit of sustainable energy solutions. These systems address the challenges associated with fluctuations and intermittency in renewable energy sources. Among various flow battery types, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have gained significant attention due to their high efficiency, scalability, safety, and near-room-temperature operation conditions. Moreover, VRFBs allow for the independent sizing of power and energy capacities, making them an attractive option for stationary grid energy storage.

The core of VRFBs lies in the redox reactions that occur at the surfaces of electrodes in contact with the electrolyte. Modifying the electrode surface can significantly influence the electrochemical activity and, in turn, overall battery performance. In a recent study, scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have focused on understanding the surface functionality of carbon electrodes and their propensity for degradation during electrochemical cycles. This knowledge is crucial for extending the lifespans of VRFBs and optimizing their performance.

The researchers employed a combined experimental-theoretical approach based on carbon K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize carbon electrodes prepared under different conditions. By doing so, they aimed to identify relevant functional groups contributing to unique spectroscopic features and understand their role in determining the electrochemical performance of the electrodes.

Introduction

Imagine a world where renewable energy is harnessed not just from the sun, wind, and water but also from the simple mixture of saltwater and freshwater. This concept may sound like something out of a science fiction novel, but researchers are bringing it closer to reality. In a recent study published in ACS Energy Letters, scientists have developed a groundbreaking semipermeable membrane that converts osmotic energy into electricity with unprecedented efficiency.

The Power of Osmosis

Estuaries, where rivers meet the sea, are brimming with untapped renewable energy. The meeting of freshwater and saltwater creates a unique environment with varying salt concentrations, offering a potential source of sustainable ""blue"" energy. Osmotic energy, generated through the natural process of osmosis, can be harnessed from these salt gradients and transformed into electricity. While osmotic energy has the potential to be generated anywhere salt gradients are found, the technologies currently available to capture this energy source have yet to reach their full potential.

Improving Osmotic Energy Harvesting

One method of capturing osmotic energy involves an array of reverse electrodialysis (RED) membranes, which function like a ""salt battery."" These membranes generate electricity from pressure differences caused by the salt gradient. To maximize the harvesting power of these membranes, they must maintain a low internal electrical resistance, allowing electrons to flow freely in the opposite direction of the ions.

Previous research suggests that improving both the flow of ions across the RED membrane and the efficiency of electron transport would likely increase the amount of electricity captured from osmotic energy. With this in mind, Dongdong Ye, Xingzhen Qin, and their colleagues set out to design a semipermeable membrane from environmentally friendly materials that would minimize internal resistance and maximize output power.

The Power of Decoupling

The researchers' RED membrane prototype contained separate channels for ion transport and electron transport. By sandwiching a negatively charged cellulose hydrogel (for ion transport) between layers of an organic, electrically conductive polymer called polyaniline (for electron transport), they created a decoupled transport system.

Abstract: This novel salt battery membrane substantially enhances osmotic energy conversion, offering a significant advancement for clean power generation. The decoupled transport system effectively reduces internal resistance, boosting power density by 50% in laboratory tests, compared to conventional RED membranes. With ongoing development and scaling, this membrane technology holds promise for real-world osmotic energy solutions in the near future.

Introduction: Researchers have discovered an innovative semipermeable membrane design that effectively converts osmotic energy into electricity, paving the way for a more eco-friendly energy future. By unlocking the potential of osmotic gradients, this technology offers an untapped and sustainable source of clean energy.

Background: Estuaries, where rivers meet the sea, present a unique opportunity for harnessing renewable energy from osmotic gradients. The mixing of freshwater and saltwater generates varying salt concentrations, offering a potential source of ""blue"" energy. Existing technologies for capturing osmotic energy, however, have yet to realize their full potential. In this study, researchers develop a membrane that effectively decouples ion transport and electron transport, thereby minimizing internal resistance and maximizing output power.

Methodology: The researchers' RED membrane prototype consists of separate channels for ion transport and electron transport, utilizing a cellulose hydrogel for ion transport and an organic, electrically conductive polymer called polyaniline for electron transport.

Results: Laboratory tests demonstrate a 50% improvement in power density compared to conventional RED membranes, indicating the potential for further improvements in power density and long-term stability.

Scientists at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have developed a cutting-edge technique that combines machine learning with X-ray microscopy. This revolutionary method, called streaming ptychography, enables researchers to process data in real-time, increasing the rate of data processing by over 100-fold and reducing data collection volume by 25%. As a result, scientists can now make split-second decisions during experiments, revolutionizing the way autonomous discovery is conducted.

Traditionally, analyzing data from X-ray microscopy studies could take days to weeks without a supercomputer and hours even with one. However, the new neural network allows researchers to conduct experiments in mere minutes at the full speed of the instrument. This development paves the way for quicker, more efficient experimentation and adjustments, giving researchers the ability to adapt almost immediately to new and interesting findings.

Streaming ptychography functions similarly to a video-streaming app like Netflix, adjusting the experiment in real-time as scientists or machine learning agents react to the data being analyzed. This real-time analysis allows for on-the-fly adjustments and rapid decision-making, ultimately saving researchers time and resources.

Ptychography, an imaging technique widely used in X-ray, optical, and electron microscopy, has been known for its ability to provide high-resolution imaging of centimeter-sized objects with minimal sample preparation. However, traditional image processing methods can be slow and computationally intensive, hindering real-time imaging. The streaming process addresses this challenge by deploying high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) to carry out the first round of computationally intensive phase retrieval calculations from diffraction patterns generated by X-ray beams.

The potential applications of streaming ptychography extend beyond X-ray microscopy. This technique can be used in a wide range of experiments where real-time adjustments based on data are necessary.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, demonstrating human-like abilities such as image recognition and question-answering. However, unlike the human mind, AI systems typically maintain consistent performance or even enhance their skills over time. A group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine sought to emulate aging and neurodegeneration in AI agents to better understand complex systems, enhance their interpretability, and improve security.

The researchers, led by Yu-Dai Tsai, did not aim to replicate human brain diseases but instead focused on producing cognitive declines in AI agents to gain insights into the functioning of these complex systems. The team utilized IQ tests performed by large language models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA 2 model, to introduce the concept of 'neural erosion.' This deliberate erosion involves ablating synapses or neurons or adding Gaussian noise during or after training, resulting in a controlled decline in the LLMs' performance.

The researchers found that when artificial synapses or neurons of the LLaMA 2 model were removed, its performance on IQ tests declined, following a particular pattern. This decline in performance could shed light on the capabilities that are first and last to decline when an AI system's underlying structure is compromised. The team observed that the LLM lost its abstract thinking abilities, followed by mathematical degradation, and ultimately, a loss in linguistic ability, responding to prompts incoherently.

This 'neuro-erosion' pattern in AI systems aligns with the neurodegeneration patterns observed in humans, where mathematical and linguistic abilities decline after abstract thinking abilities. Although this research does not aim to replicate human brain diseases, it could inspire other research groups to explore dedicated neurodegeneration in AI agents and pave the way towards the development of new techniques that leverage the observed AI neuro-erosion patterns to tackle real-world problems.

Tsai and his collaborators plan to develop their study into specific tests of AI systems and extend the emulation to other neural diseases and neurodiversity. They also aim to apply their methods to improve AI security and interpretability, emphasizing that their primary focus remains on exploring new frontiers in AI studies.

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), generating false or unverifiable information is often considered a weakness. However, within the context of bacterial research, AI hallucinations are paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries and life-saving drugs. A collaborative effort between Stanford Medicine and McMaster University has led to the development of an AI model, SyntheMol, which has designed potential solutions for deadly antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis, accounting for an estimated 4.95 million deaths annually. The urgent need for novel antibiotics has driven researchers to explore innovative approaches, such as leveraging AI to generate new molecules with therapeutic potential. James Zou, an associate professor of biomedical data science and co-author of the study, explains, ""Our hypothesis was that there are a lot of potential molecules out there that could be effective drugs, but we haven't made or tested them yet. That's why we wanted to use AI to design entirely new molecules that have never been seen in nature.""

Traditional methods of discovering new antibiotics relied on sorting through drug libraries, which proved to be time-consuming and inefficient. The exponential number of potential chemical compounds made it nearly impossible to explore the entire chemical space. SyntheMol's computing power and ability to hallucinate have allowed researchers to bypass these limitations, efficiently exploring solutions to AMR.

Researchers trained SyntheMol using a library of molecular building blocks and chemical reactions, with data on effective chemicals against Acinetobacter baumannii as a guide. The model generated around 25,000 possible antibiotics and their synthesis recipes in under nine hours. However, the initial suggestions required some refinement, as some compounds were not feasible and others risked promoting bacterial resistance.

To address these challenges, researchers incorporated guardrails to ensure the feasibility of the compounds and filtered out those with high similarity to existing antibiotics.

Engineers often employ hardware accelerators to enhance computational efficiency, but these components can be vulnerable to attacks, leading to the potential exposure of sensitive user data, such as health records or financial information.

A novel machine-learning accelerator, developed by researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, aims to address these security concerns. This chip resists two common types of attacks while keeping user data private, allowing for efficient operation of large AI models on smartphones and other devices. This article discusses the challenges of securing machine-learning accelerators, the optimizations implemented in this new chip, and its potential applications in various AI-driven fields.

The Challenge of Securing Machine-Learning Accelerators

Machine-learning accelerators, such as digital in-memory compute (IMC) chips, perform computations within a device's memory, where pieces of a machine-learning model are stored after being moved from a central server. These chips reduce data movement by breaking the model into smaller pieces and reusing them as much as possible. However, IMC chips can be susceptible to side-channel and bus-probing attacks, where hackers monitor power consumption or steal bits of the model and dataset through communication between the accelerator and off-chip memory.

To address these security concerns, the researchers developed a three-pronged approach:

1. Data Splitting: The researchers employed a security measure that splits data into random pieces within the IMC, making it difficult for side-channel attacks to reconstruct the original information. Each piece is computed separately, so no single operation can reveal the actual data.
2. Lightweight Cipher: To prevent bus-probing attacks, the team utilized a lightweight cipher to encrypt the model stored in off-chip memory. This cipher only requires simple computations and is decrypted only when necessary.
3. Physically Unclonable Function: A unique key is generated directly on the chip using random variations introduced during manufacturing.

Title: Spotify Stands Up to Apple's App Store Rules: A Battle for Developer Rights and User Choice

Spotify recently made headlines by submitting a new version of its app for EU users, adhering to the European Commission's ruling on music streaming services. This update comes after Apple announced changes to its Digital Markets Act (DMA), which introduces a ""core technology fee"" for developers with over 1 million annual downloads. However, Spotify has decided not to opt into these new rules.

In a statement, Dustee Jenkins, Spotify's chief public affairs officer, emphasized the company's commitment to providing users with a genuine choice and no additional costs. The revised app includes basic pricing and website information, aligning with the European Commission's requirements. However, it does not contain a link to Spotify's website, as Apple's DMA changes would charge developers for in-app links.

Spotify's primary concern is Apple's alleged violation of European law by charging developers to communicate with their consumers through in-app links. The music streaming giant argues that, under the DMA, gatekeepers like Apple's App Store should enable businesses to promote various offers to users within their apps.

This conflict arose when Spotify submitted a previous update featuring a link to its website, which Apple did not approve. Apple has remained silent on the matter, while Spotify continues to advocate for the rights of developers and users alike. The European Commission imposed a €1.84 billion ($2 billion) fine on Apple for its anticompetitive practices in the music streaming market, further fueling the controversy.

Once approved, the new Spotify app version will allow EU free users to view premium plan perks and pricing information. However, users will not be able to click on a link within the app to purchase those plans. Instead, they will be directed to visit the website via their browsers and buy a plan.

This battle highlights the ongoing tension between tech giants and developers, with Spotify leading the charge for greater transparency and user choice. By pushing back against Apple's restrictive App Store rules, Spotify contributes to a larger conversation about fairness and competition in the digital marketplace.

NFFT's real-time adaptation based on flight data and rotor effectiveness detects and compensates for errors in less than a second, paving the way for safer autonomous flight.","Title: Soaring Above Turbulence: A Neural-Fly Approach to Fault Tolerance in Autonomous Flying Vehicles

Introduction

Imagine a future where air taxis and autonomous flying vehicles weave through the skies, bypassing ground traffic congestion. Companies are already developing hybrid electric ""flying cars"" that take off and land vertically, transitioning to winged flight for efficient travel over longer distances. Safety remains a paramount concern, with aircraft needing to withstand various disturbances during flight, from gusty winds to failing components. A team of engineers at Caltech, led by Soon-Jo Chung, has developed an onboard machine learning-based control method, Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance (NFFT), to help autonomous aerial vehicles maintain control in the face of disturbances and failures.

The Challenge of Redundancy and Failure Detection

Hybrid electric aircraft typically have multiple propellers, or rotors, for redundancy. However, the addition of fixed wings to reduce energy consumption increases the number of possible failure points. Traditional methods of adding sensors for each rotor would be expensive, cumbersome, and subject to failure themselves. 

NFFT: A Deep Learning Approach

Chung's group has developed an innovative deep-learning method to detect and respond to onboard failures without requiring additional sensors or hardware. NFFT relies on a pre-trained neural network using real-life flight data and real-time adaptation based on changing parameters, including rotor effectiveness. By observing the aircraft's attitude and position over time, NFFT detects deviations from the desired path and compensates for errors in less than a second, ensuring seamless control even in the event of a motor failure.

Virtual Sensors for Fault Detection

NFFT's real-time control signals and algorithms effectively provide free virtual sensors for fault detection, applicable to any type of vehicle. The team has primarily tested the control method on the Autonomous Flying Ambulance, a hybrid electric vehicle designed for rapid transportation of injured or ill individuals to hospitals.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced in recent years, particularly in the realm of content generation. From producing artistic images based on text descriptions to creating datasets for robotics algorithms, AI-driven content generation has opened up new possibilities in various fields. However, generating videos of moving human figures based on human instructions has remained a challenging task.

In a fascinating development, a team of researchers from Beijing Institute of Technology, BIGAI, and Peking University introduced an innovative framework in a paper presented at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024. This new framework effectively tackles the challenge of language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes, building upon the team's previous work, HUMANIZE.

The researchers aimed to improve the model's ability to generalize well across new problems, such as creating realistic motions in response to prompts like ""lie down on the floor"" after learning to generate ""lie down on the bed"" motions. To achieve this, they developed a two-stage method consisting of an Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for affordance map prediction and an Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM) for generating human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance.

The key innovation lies in employing scene affordance as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively link 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation. Scene affordance refers to the possibilities for interaction between an agent and its environment. By utilizing affordance maps derived from the distance field between human skeleton joints and scene surfaces, the model gains a deep understanding of the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, ultimately improving its generalization across diverse scene geometries.

The proposed framework offers several advantages over previous approaches for language-guided human motion generation. Its use of scene affordance allows for clearer representation of the region associated with user descriptions/prompts, enhancing 3D grounding capabilities and enabling the creation of convincing motions with limited training data. Furthermore, the affordance maps provide a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between scenes and motions, aiding generalization across various scene geometries.
