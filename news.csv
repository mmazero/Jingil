https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080, Predicting Outdoor Days in 2100: How Climate Change Will Impact Your Life ,"In recent years, the concept of climate change has become more and more difficult to comprehend. The terms ""global warming,"" ""climate crisis,"" and ""global weirding"" all try to describe the phenomenon, but they can be hard to understand. However, a team of researchers at MIT may have finally found a way to make it relatable.

Instead of predicting extreme weather events like hurricanes or heat days, the researchers have developed a tool that allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked. This tool could help people better understand the impact of climate change on their lives.

The results of the tool are both comforting and alarming. In some regions, like California, France, and Germany, the climate will become a little bit more hospitable in the spring and fall, adding anywhere from a few days to nearly a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records. However, other regions, like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan, will lose a week or more of outdoor days.

The most vulnerable populations will suffer the most. Nigeria's summers will grow even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India will lose almost two and a half months.

Despite these alarming predictions, there is hope. Even if the world fails to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but still manages to by 2070, the situation will improve dramatically. Nigeria and India would only lose one month of outdoor days, and more northerly regions retain some of their added outdoor days.

This tool, known as climate scenario analysis, is a branch of strategic planning that seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. It's not a new field, but as advances in computational power have fostered more sophisticated climate models, it has become more broadly applicable than before.

A range of startups are using this predictive capability to help give shape to an uncertain future. Many startups in the space are focused on tackling that uncertainty for investors, lenders, and insurers. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on these markets, supplying customers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. The startups also determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought, and they'll deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains. They can also crank out regulatory disclosures, highlighting relevant climate risks.

Other markets exposed to the outdoors are also in need of solutions. ClimateAI is targeting agriculture, including agribusiness, lenders, and food and beverage companies, all of which have watched as droughts, floods, and storms have decimated crops. Sensible Weather is working on markets that are a little closer to home for most of us. It provides insurance for people embarking on outdoor events and activities, from live concerts to camping and golfing.

As more businesses and consumers become aware of how climate change is affecting their lives, their demand for certainty will create a wealth of new markets that will offer these startups and their peers ample opportunity to expand. Climate scenario analysis, once a niche limited to academic labs and insurance companies, appears poised to enter the mainstream.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,Understand the impact of climate change on your region with this new tool developed by MIT.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-fabricating-high-density-vertical.html,A new strategy for fabricating high-density vertical organic electrochemical transistor arrays, High-Density Vertical OECT Arrays Fabrication Strategy,"Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECTs) are a new class of transistors that use organic superconducting materials to modulate electrical current in response to small changes in voltage applied to their gate electrode. They can be used for various brain-inspired and wearable technologies due to their advantages such as amplification and sensing capabilities, low driving voltages, and versatile structures. However, most conventional OECTs developed so far have limitations, including limited stability and slow redox processes, which can impair their performance.

Researchers at Northwestern University have recently developed a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs. They used electron beam exposure to create OECT arrays and circuits, which allowed for the multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits. The fabrication strategy resulted in p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays with transconductances of 0.08-1.7 S and transient times of less than 100 µs. Moreover, the researchers successfully used the strategy to create various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates, which performed remarkably well while maintaining excellent operational stability.

In this article, we will discuss the details of the fabrication strategy used by the researchers, the resulting OECT arrays and circuits, and their potential applications. We will also explore the limitations of conventional OECTs and how this new strategy could improve their stability and performance.

Fabrication Strategy

The Northwestern University researchers used electron beam exposure to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits. Electron beam exposure is a lithography technique that uses a direct beam of electrons to pattern materials without employing masks or chemical solvents. This technique allows for the precise and fine-tuned patterning of materials, which is essential for OECT fabrication.

To fabricate the OECT arrays, the researchers first exposed both p- and n-channel organic semiconductor films to a direct beam of electrons. This process resulted in a pattern on the semiconducting films without any damage to the materials. The patterned films were ultra-small and high-density while presenting well-defined, conducting channel regions. Furthermore, the e-beam exposure strategy employed by",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/high-density-vertical.jpg,2024-03-31 09:00:01,"the researchers allowed for the integration of p- and n-type OECT structures into the same array, which is essential for realizing complex logic circuits.

In addition, the researchers used a combination of e-beam exposure and chemical doping to create various OECT structures, such as p-n junctions, double-gated transistors, and metal-organic frameworks, which are essential for realizing complex logic circuits.

Results

The fabrication strategy developed by the researchers resulted in high-performance OECT arrays and circuits. The OECT arrays had transconductances ranging from 0.08-1.7 S and transient times of less than 100 µs. Moreover, the researchers successfully used the OECT arrays to create various vertically stacked logic circuits, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates, which performed remarkably well while maintaining excellent operational stability.

The high-performance OECT arrays and circuits fabricated by the researchers have several potential applications, such as brain-inspired computing, wearable technologies, and sensing systems. For instance, OECTs can be used to amplify weak electrical signals in the brain, which could lead to new insights into brain function. Moreover, OECTs can be integrated into wearable devices to monitor vital signs and other physiological parameters.

Limitations

Although the fabrication strategy developed by the researchers has several advantages, it also has limitations. One of the main limitations is the limited stability of the OECT structures, which can cause performance degradation over time. Additionally, the redox processes involved in OECT operation can be slow, which can impair their performance.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Northwestern University researchers have developed a new fabrication strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits using electron beam exposure. The strategy resulted in high-performance OECT arrays and circuits with transconductances ranging from 0.08-1.7 S and transient times of less than 100 µs. The OECT arrays and circuits have several potential applications, such as brain-inspired computing, wearable technologies, and sensing systems. However, the limited stability and slow redox processes of conventional OECTs can impair their performance, which needs to be addressed by future research.", OECT ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Without it, the assistant can only provide generic responses, which may not be useful or relevant. To ensure that the AI assistant understands the user's intent, it needs to be trained on a large dataset of conversations and examples. This dataset should include a diverse range of user queries and responses, as well as any cultural or regional nuances that may affect the user's preferences or behavior.

Another key factor that can affect the performance of an AI assistant is the quality of the language model used to generate responses. A good language model should be able to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses that sound natural and engaging to the user. This requires a deep understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

To ensure that the language model used in an AI assistant is of high quality, it should be trained on a large corpus of text that reflects the user's preferences and interests. This corpus should include a diverse range of sources, such as news articles, books, social media posts, and user reviews. By training the language model on a diverse range of sources, the assistant can generate responses that are relevant, engaging, and informative.

In addition to language processing techniques, the performance of an AI assistant can also be affected by the user interface and interaction design. The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear and concise instructions for using the assistant. The interaction design should be designed to guide the user towards the information they need, while also providing opportunities for exploration and discovery.

Overall, the success of an AI assistant depends on a combination of factors, including the quality of the data used to train the language model, the effectiveness of the NLP techniques used to generate responses, and the design of the user interface and interaction.

It plays a crucial role in connecting individuals, businesses, and communities. With the rapid advancements in technology, the transportation industry is constantly evolving, and it is essential to keep up with the latest developments.

One of the most significant developments in the transportation industry is the shift towards electric vehicles. Companies such as Tesla, Nissan, and others are making significant strides in developing and producing electric vehicles. However, the industry is also facing challenges, including financial difficulties, production delays, and regulatory hurdles.

In this edition of TechCrunch Mobility, we will discuss the latest developments in the transportation industry, including the challenges and opportunities. We will also highlight some of the key players in the industry and their recent activities.

Let's get started.

Fisker's Troubles

Fisker, an electric vehicle startup, recently faced significant challenges, including production delays, financial difficulties, and regulatory hurdles. The company had to pause production for six weeks, with only $121 million in cash and cash equivalents, $32 million of which was restricted or not immediately accessible. The company was counting on a $150 million influx of capital via convertible notes and a potential partnership with another automaker. However, those hopes were shattered when negotiations between Fisker and the large automaker fell apart, putting that convertible note deal in jeopardy.

Fisker's troubles did not end there. The company temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete. This incident is particularly embarrassing for the company and raises questions about its management and financial stability.

Arrival's Assets

Arrival, another electric vehicle startup, recently sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to Canoo, another struggling startup trying to build and sell electric vehicles. This move highlights the challenges facing many electric vehicle startups and the need for strategic partnerships to survive in the industry.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/the-market-is-forcing-cloud-vendors-to-relax-data-egress-fees/,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees, Cloud Vendors Ease Egress Fees Amid Multi-Cloud Shift ,"In recent years, the big three cloud vendors Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have relaxed their egress fees, which are a kind of tax that the cloud companies charge customers to move their data to another vendor. This is an effort to keep existing customers in the fold, but it’s not a great way to do it and doesn’t foster goodwill.

As a number of factors come into play, such as the reality of a multi-cloud world, a stricter regulatory environment, and consumer backlash, these companies are beginning to see the error in their ways. They have started to ease these fees, albeit with some caveats and friction involved. For example, there are limits to the kind of data you can move, and each requires you to contact the vendor and open a request to get your data out of the cloud. But it’s a start.

This change of heart is really an acknowledgement of changing market dynamics, says John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director at Synergy Research, a firm that tracks the cloud infrastructure market. “I think this is a natural progression of the market. As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist,” Dinsdale said.

“Giving customers what they want is just the right business strategy. In the IT world of the last few years, legacy companies that have tried to hang on to the old ways of doing things have not done well,” he said.

It’s also clear that we are moving into a multi-cloud world where it’s more important than ever to remove friction around moving data. This is a challenge that affects both startups and larger enterprise customers.

Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, says the shift is partly due to regulatory pressure but that it’s not the only reason. “The emergence of regulation is a pretty simple explanation for the sudden change in behavior,” she said. However, she warns that egress fees are not the only problem, and customers have to consider the costs holistically.

David Linthicum, a longtime cloud consultant, says that while the recent announcements are a pleasant PR move, he warns folks to review their bills carefully. “This is a nice surprise, but it’s not necessarily consequential. Customers have to consider the costs holistically,” Linthicum said.

Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder at Bobsled, a startup that helps customers move data between clouds, agrees that the recent changes are a small but important step. However, he also sees a future where it’s increasingly difficult to determine what is an egress fee and what’s not, which could lead to the ultimate demise of these fees.

Overall, the shift towards a multi-cloud world and increased competition is driving cloud providers to be more customer-focused and remove friction around moving data. This is a positive development for both startups and larger enterprise customers, but it’s important for customers to consider the costs holistically.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738",2024-03-31 16:00:41,Egress Fees Eased: A Positive Shift Towards Multi-Cloud and Competition in the Cloud Industry.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-optimization-based-method-autonomous.html,An optimization-based method to enhance autonomous parking, Optimize Autonomous Parking with OCEAN: A Review of the Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner ,"Introduction:

Self-driving cars are becoming increasingly popular, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is automated valet parking (AVP). This feature would allow cars to drive themselves into a parking spot, freeing up valuable space and reducing traffic congestion. However, developing a reliable AVP system has proved challenging, and many obstacles must be overcome to make it a reality. In this article, we will explore a new approach to AVP, called OCEAN, developed by a team of researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai.

Body:

Autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars, have been a long-sought-after goal for both robotics research and the automotive industry. Although several companies have been investing in these vehicles and testing them, they have only been deployed in a limited number of settings. In recent years, some researchers have been exploring the possibility of automated valet parking (AVP), a function that would allow a car to drive itself from the entrance of a parking lot to a free parking spot. However, the reliable realization of AVP has so far proved challenging.

Researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai recently developed OCEAN, an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner for the autonomous parking of vehicles. The paper pre-published on arXiv found that OCEAN significantly enhanced the ability of cars to safely reach a parking spot without colliding with objects on the way.

The OCEAN planner was designed to overcome the two primary shortcomings of approaches presented in previous studies tackling autonomous parking. The first of these is the inability to accurately predict collisions, while the second entails poor performance in real-time tests. The OCEAN planner builds on a previously introduced approach called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA), addressing its primary limitations. Its improved design ultimately improves its ability to avoid collisions, along with its robustness and speed in real-time.

The trajectory planning problem is first warm-started by a collision-free Hybrid A trajectory, and then the collision avoidance trajectory planning problem is reformulated as a smooth and convex dual form and solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) in parallel. The optimization variables are carefully split into several groups so that ADMM sub-problems are formulated as Quadratic Programming (QP), Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problems that can be efficiently and robustly solved.

The researchers tested their planner on hundreds of simulated scenarios and conducted real-world experiments in public parking areas. OCEAN was found to outperform a variety of methods for autonomous parking applications. The results showed that the proposed method has better system performance compared with other benchmarks, making it possible to deploy large-scale parking planner on low computing power platforms that require real-time performance.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, OCEAN is an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner that has been developed by a team of researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai. The planner was designed to overcome the two primary shortcomings of approaches presented in previous studies tackling autonomous parking. The OCEAN planner builds on a previously introduced approach called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA), addressing its primary limitations. The results show that the proposed method has better system performance compared with other benchmarks, making it possible to deploy large-scale parking planner on low computing power platforms that require real-time performance. OCEAN could be improved and tested in additional real-world trials, and it could be deployed by automotive companies, contributing to the introduction of automated vehicle parking technologies.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/an-optimization-based.jpg,2024-03-30 09:00:01,Would you like me to rephrase the Meta Description?, real-time autonomous parking ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

April 1st, 2004: The Unveiling of Gmail - A Game-Changing Email Service

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin loved to pull pranks, so much so that they began rolling outlandish ideas every April Fool's Day. That's why when they unveiled Gmail, a free email service with 1 gigabyte of storage per account, it was no exception. The idea of having so much email storage space was considered preposterous in an age of one-terabyte iPhones, yet Gmail offered 250 to 500 times more email storage space.

But it wasn't just the storage that made Gmail stand out. The service also came with Google's search technology, allowing users to quickly retrieve old emails, photos, and personal information. Gmail also automatically threaded together a string of communications about the same topic, making it easier for users to follow conversations.

The original pitch for Gmail focused on three main aspects - storage, search, and speed. The service was designed to change people's perceptions about what was possible within a web browser. It was such a mind-bending concept that when The Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on April Fool's Day 2004, readers called and emailed to inform the news agency that they had been duped by Google's pranksters.

However, the AP knew that Gmail wasn't a prank because an AP reporter had been abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make the trip worthwhile. After arriving at the still-developing corporate campus, the AP reporter was ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while sitting in front of his laptop computer.

Page, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail's sleekly designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within Microsoft's now-retired Explorer web browser. He also pointed out that there was no delete button featured in the main control window because it wouldn't be necessary, given Gmail had so much storage and could be easily searched. ""I think people are really going to like this,"" Page predicted.

As with so many other things, Page was right. Today, Gmail has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts, each one now offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. Even though that's 15 times more storage than Gmail initially offered, it's still not enough for many users who rarely see the need to purge their accounts, just as Google hoped.

The digital hoarding of email, photos, and other content is why Google, Apple, and other companies now make money from selling additional storage capacity in their data centers. In Google's case, it charges anywhere from $30 annually for 200 gigabytes of storage to $250 annually for 5 terabytes of storage. Gmail's existence has revolutionized email communication, making it faster, more efficient, and more convenient.

The digital age has transformed the way we communicate, and Gmail has played a significant role in that transformation. As we continue to rely more on technology, Gmail's impact will only continue to grow. The service's success is a testament to the power of innovation and the ability to adapt to the changing needs of users.

In conclusion, Gmail's unveiling on April Fool's Day 2004 was a game-changer in the world of email communication. With its sleek design, powerful search functionality, and vast storage capacity, Gmail has transformed the way we communicate and store our digital information. The service's impact will only continue to grow as we continue to rely more on technology, and its success is a testament to the power of innovation and the ability to adapt to the changing needs of users.

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-has-reportedly-been-blocked-on-all-congress-owned-devices-034946166.html,Microsoft Copilot has reportedly been blocked on all Congress-owned devices, Microsoft Copilot Blocked on Congress-Owned Devices due to Data Leak Concerns ,"Introduction:

Microsoft's Copilot, an AI chatbot designed to assist users in completing tasks, has been prohibited from use on government-issued devices by the United States Congress. This decision was made due to concerns about the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services. While individuals can still use Copilot on their personal phones and laptops, the chatbot has been blocked on all Windows devices owned by the Congress.

Body:

The prohibition of Copilot on government-issued devices marks a significant shift in the use of AI chatbots in the government sector. The Office of Cybersecurity has deemed Copilot to be a risk, as it could potentially expose sensitive data to unauthorized cloud services. This concern has led to the prohibition of the chatbot's use on government-issued devices.

It is worth noting that the Congress has also set strict limits on the use of ChatGPT, another AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's large language models. Staffers were previously banned from using the free version of ChatGPT on House computers, but the paid version (ChatGPT Plus) was still allowed for research and evaluation purposes due to its tighter privacy controls.

Recently, the White House has revealed rules that federal agencies must follow when it comes to generative AI. These rules aim to ensure that any tool used by federal agencies does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans. Microsoft recognizes the need for higher security requirements in government use and has announced a roadmap of tools and services designed for government use. These tools and services will feature higher levels of security, making them suitable for handling sensitive data.

Szpindor's office will evaluate the government version of Copilot when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. The use of AI chatbots in government is still a relatively new concept, and it is important to ensure that these tools are secure and do not pose a risk to sensitive data.

Conclusion:

The prohibition of Copilot on government-issued devices is a significant step in ensuring the security of sensitive data. While the chatbot can still be used on personal devices, it is essential to evaluate its use on government-issued devices to ensure that it does not pose a risk. The use of AI chatbots in government is still a relatively new concept, and it is crucial to ensure that these tools are secure and do not endanger the rights and safety of Americans.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"Meta Description: ""Microsoft Copilot banned from government-issued devices in the U.S. due to security concerns.
