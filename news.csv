In the realm of space exploration, SpaceX has recently completed an investigation into the second Starship launch, conducted in November. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed the findings and accepted the company's analysis of the root causes and proposed corrective actions.

This review marks a significant step towards SpaceX's goal of resuming Starship flights. However, before they can take to the skies again, SpaceX must implement the corrective actions and seek approval for a modified launch license.

The second orbital test of the colossal Starship rocket pushed the boundaries of space exploration, achieving a remarkable feat by successfully igniting all 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster. This milestone marked a significant improvement over the first test conducted in April.

Despite these advancements, the flight culminated in a dramatic mid-air explosion, prompting a thorough mishap investigation. Such investigations are standard procedure when catastrophic issues arise during rocket launches.

SpaceX, in collaboration with regulatory bodies, conducted a comprehensive analysis, identifying a total of 17 corrective actions. These measures address various aspects of the booster and Starship vehicle, aiming to enhance robustness, reduce complexity, and prevent similar incidents from occurring.

One notable finding was the root cause of the booster's explosion: a filter blockage in a single Raptor engine. This isolated engine failure led to an energetic disintegration of the booster, resulting in its complete loss.

Additionally, the Starship upper stage encountered a propellant leak, causing a fire that disrupted communication between onboard computers. This resulted in an engine shutdown and ultimately triggered the autonomous flight termination system, leading to the vehicle's destruction.

SpaceX has already begun implementing some of these corrective actions and design upgrades in preparation for the third orbital flight test. This mission is targeted for early March, showcasing the company's commitment to rapid learning and iterative improvement.

The ultimate goal is to execute the full mission profile, including a controlled splashdown of the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico and a precise landing of Starship in the Pacific Ocean.

SpaceX's unwavering pursuit of a fully reusable launch system promises to pave the way for diverse missions, carrying satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to various orbits and extraterrestrial destinations, propelling humanity's exploration of the cosmos.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/instagram-confirms-developing-snap-map-like-friend-map-feature/,Instagram is working on a 'Friend Map' feature that would let you track friends' locations,"

In a move that echoes the footsteps of Snapchat and Apple, Instagram is reportedly developing a feature called ""Friend Map."" This opt-in feature, akin to Snapchat's Snap Map, aims to allow users to track their friends' locations in real time. Though currently an internal prototype, this feature has the potential to revolutionize the way we connect and interact with our friends on the platform.

If Instagram decides to officially launch the Friend Map, it would mark another instance of the platform replicating popular features from its competitors. In 2016, Instagram famously cloned Snapchat's core Stories functionality, forever changing the way users share their moments. Now, with the Friend Map, Instagram sets its sights on Apple's ""Find My"" map feature, which allows users to locate their friends and family.

This strategic move by Instagram serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it provides users with an additional reason to spend more time on the app, potentially increasing engagement and reducing the allure of other social media platforms. Secondly, it taps into the void left by Zenly, a social map app acquired and subsequently shut down by Snap last year. By offering a similar feature, Instagram positions itself to attract users who were fans of Zenly.

The Friend Map, as revealed by screenshots shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, offers users granular control over who can see their location. Users can choose to share their whereabouts with mutual followers, their ""Close Friends"" list, or keep it private. Additionally, the map incorporates a ""Ghost Mode"" setting, allowing users to conceal their last active location.

Beyond location sharing, the Friend Map introduces a new feature called ""Notes."" These short messages, similar to Instagram Notes that appear at the top of the direct messaging feed, can be posted on the map for others to see. This functionality opens up creative possibilities, such as notifying friends about exciting pop-up shops or sharing the location of a new restaurant you're currently dining at.

Instagram's foray into enhanced in-app mapping began in late 2022 with the introduction of a searchable map experience. This feature allowed users to explore popular tagged locations nearby and filter results by categories like restaurants, cafes, and beauty salons. This move was a direct response to Google's Senior Vice President Prabhakar Raghavan's observation that young users increasingly turn to apps like Instagram and TikTok for local discovery, rather than traditional search engines or mapping services.

With the Friend Map, Instagram sets its sights on becoming the go-to platform for social mapping, aiming to dethrone Snapchat and Apple in this domain. While the feature is still in its early stages of development, it has the potential to reshape the way we navigate our social circles and discover new places.

Threads Unveils Bookmarks and More, Mimicking Twitter's X

Threads, Instagram's Twitter-like app, is evolving to resemble its rival X even more. In a series of recent updates, Threads has introduced trending topics, an in-app camera, drafts, and now, a bookmarking feature that lets users save posts privately without publicly ""liking"" them.

Bookmarking has been a popular feature among X users and news enthusiasts. It allows users to curate a collection of links and posts for later reference. Whether it's a lengthy article to read later or a piece of information to recall, bookmarking provides a convenient way to keep track of important content. On X, paid subscribers can even organize their bookmarks into different folders for easier access.

While X offers easy access to the bookmarking icon at the bottom of each post, Threads' new feature is a bit more hidden. Instead of saving posts from the main timeline, users must tap on the three-dot menu to find the ""Save"" option. To access saved posts later, users need to navigate to the app's Settings screen.

Upon announcing the new bookmarking feature via Threads, several users expressed their frustration in the comments, stating that they didn't yet have access to this feature or the recently announced trends. Instagram is rolling out these new features in phases, not releasing them to all Threads users simultaneously. This gradual rollout is partly due to Threads' limited engineering resources compared to other Meta projects and because Threads itself is a sizable app with approximately 130 million monthly active users.

In addition to bookmarks, Threads users have also noticed other new features. Some users have begun receiving notifications from Threads and Facebook within their Instagram notifications. In an effort to expand its user base, Threads is also testing a cross-posting feature from Facebook to Threads.

As Threads continues to evolve, it's clear that Instagram is determined to make it a more comprehensive and competitive platform. By introducing features that mimic X's successful offerings, Threads aims to attract more users and establish itself as a leading social media platform in its own right.
