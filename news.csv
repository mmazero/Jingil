In a surprising turn of events, Tesla seems to have abandoned its plans to build a more affordable electric vehicle (EV), reportedly priced around $25,000, which would have been a significant leap towards the company's overall growth strategy. According to Reuters, the innovative automaker has decided to divert its resources and attention to a planned robotaxi, built on the same platform initially intended for the budget-friendly EV. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has disputed these claims without providing any specific contradictory evidence.

The idea of an affordable Tesla car was first conceived a few years back, with Elon Musk teasing the concept in 2020. Despite the excitement surrounding the project, it was put on hold in early 2022 due to Tesla's numerous ongoing projects. Nevertheless, the project was swiftly revived, though the company's top executives couldn't agree on whether to prioritize a traditional car or a futuristic robotaxi, further complicating the development process.

In Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Musk, the CEO is quoted as insisting that the vehicle be designed as a clean robotaxi, stating, ""We're going to take that risk, it's my fault if it fucks up."" Musk went on to claim that the robotaxi would ""transform everything"" and catapult Tesla to a valuation of ten trillion dollars. Despite these bold statements, lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy maintained a more conventional car project as a ""shadow plan"" throughout the process.

In late 2022, Moravy and von Holzhausen presented their case to Musk for an inexpensive, small car to fuel Tesla's growth in line with the CEO's ambition of increasing the company's revenue by 50% per year. They also proposed utilizing the same platform to develop both the traditional and robotaxi models. However, Musk reportedly dismissed the idea, stating that the $25,000 car was ""really not that exciting of a project.""

Despite Musk's initial reluctance, he eventually agreed to move","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1245135186.jpg?resize=1200,756",2024-04-05 16:45:17,"Meta Description:

Mahbod Moghadam, an extraordinary figure in the startup world, passed away last month at the age of 41 due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. Known for his controversial and engaging personality, Moghadam was a catalyst for change in the digital content landscape. This article pays tribute to his life, achievements, and the lasting impact he had on the industry.

The Startup World Mourns a Colorful Character

Although news of Moghadam's passing reached the startup world only recently, touching off numerous tributes on platforms such as X, the loss is deeply felt. Josh Constine, a former TechCrunch writer and now an investor, shared his memories of Moghadam, describing him as ""a complex, edgy, and at times problematic guy, but also genuinely funny, brilliant, and always unique."" Moghadam was remembered fondly by many who had the opportunity to know and work with him.

A Passion for Empowering Creators

Moghadam had been residing in Los Angeles, where he served as an entrepreneur in residence at Mucker Capital for about 20 months. His primary focus during this time was devising ways to help content creators receive fair compensation for their work. One such project was HellaDoge, a short-lived social media platform that rewarded users in dogecoin for contributing dogecoin-related content. The idea was that users would directly benefit from their engagement, unlike traditional platforms that generate revenue through advertisements.

Moghadam's interest in creator compensation can be traced back to 2009. After graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, he became a lawyer just as the economy was collapsing. When he was eventually let go from his law firm, Moghadam used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius (later rebranded as Genius) with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman.

Introduction

Imagine a world where humans can remotely control humanoid robots to perform a wide range of tasks, from the mundane to the extraordinary. This is not a scene from a sci-fi movie but a promising reality, thanks to the innovative work of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. They have developed Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), a method that enables the effective teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. This article will delve into the fascinating world of teleoperation, the potential of H 2 O, and its implications for the future of humanoid robotics.

The Power of Teleoperation

Teleoperation refers to the control of a device from a distance, and it has the potential to revolutionize various industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to search and rescue operations. By allowing humans to perform tasks remotely, teleoperation can minimize risk, increase efficiency, and enable new possibilities.

In the context of humanoid robotics, teleoperation can help address some of the challenges faced by these machines, such as their limited ability to replicate human movements and adapt to new situations. By combining human cognitive skills with the versatile capabilities of humanoid robots, teleoperation can unlock the full potential of these machines, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks that were previously beyond their reach.

H 2 O: A Game-Changer in Teleoperation

The H 2 O method, introduced in a paper posted to the arXiv preprint server, marks a significant step forward in the field of teleoperation. By relying solely on an RGB camera, H 2 O is both scalable and accessible, making it easier to integrate into various applications and environments.

As Tairan He, co-author of the paper, explained, ""We believe that human teleoperation will be essential for scaling up the data flywheel for humanoid robots, and making teleoperation accessible and easy to do is our main objective.""

The H 2 O framework consists of several components, including a retargeting algorithm, a method for cleaning human motion data in simulations, and a reinforcement learning-based model that learns new teleoperation policies.

Introduction

Social network X has recently announced that it is expanding access to xAI's Grok chatbot, making it available to Premium tier subscribers. This move comes after Elon Musk's announcement last month revealing the expansion to more paid users. This article will discuss the recent updates and what they mean for users.

Grok Chatbot: More Accessible for Premium Users

Previously, only Premium+ users, who pay $16 per month or a $168 per year subscription fee, had access to the Grok chatbot. However, with the latest update, users paying $8 per month can now interact with the chatbot in Regular mode or Fun mode. It's worth noting that, like other Large Language Model (LLM) products, Grok includes labels to indicate when the chatbot may return inaccurate answers.

Trending News Summaries: A Step Further

Earlier this week, X rolled out a new explore view inside Grok, which summarizes trending news stories. This feature sets Grok apart from other chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude. However, Grok seems to go one step further by generating headlines, as seen in a recent incident where the chatbot wrote a fake headline about Iran striking Tel Aviv with heavy missiles.

Musk's Motivation: Competition and Criticism

Elon Musk's push for expanding access to Grok may be driven by his desire to rival other AI chatbot products and his openly critical stance towards OpenAI's operations. Musk even sued the company in March over the ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goal, a claim OpenAI is seeking to dismiss. Musk's criticism and legal action suggest a competitive landscape in the AI chatbot market.

Open-Sourcing Grok: Questions Remain

Last month, xAI open-sourced Grok, but without providing training data details. While this move raises questions about the latest version of the model and the company's transparency regarding its development approach and training data, it has generated excitement in the AI community.

In the world of cybersecurity, the value of zero-day exploits has skyrocketed as companies enhance their products' defenses against hackers. An increasing number of startups are now offering substantial sums for tools that can compromise popular devices, applications, and communication platforms.

Crowdfense, a startup specializing in acquiring and reselling zero-day exploits, recently published its updated price list. These exploits, which rely on unpatched vulnerabilities in software, can now fetch millions of dollars. Crowdfense offers between $5 and $7 million for zero-days targeting iPhones, up to $5 million for Android phones, and up to $3.5 million for Chrome and Safari exploits. Additionally, the company is willing to pay up to $5 million for WhatsApp and iMessage vulnerabilities.

These figures represent a significant increase from Crowdfense's 2019 price list, where the highest payouts were $3 million for Android and iOS zero-days. This surge in prices can be attributed to the growing difficulty in hacking devices and applications from companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft. The enhanced security measures implemented by these organizations make it increasingly challenging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

Dustin Childs, the head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement in software security: ""It should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we're using, whatever devices we're using."" As more zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed, the time and resources required to find new ones increase, driving up their associated costs.

Google's Threat Analysis Group reported that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild in 2023, with 75% of them targeting Google products and Android devices. The growing complexity of discovering and exploiting these vulnerabilities has led to a corresponding increase in their market value.

David Manouchehri, a security analyst with knowledge of the zero-day market, stated, ""hard targets like Google's Pixel and the iPhone have been becoming harder to hack every year.

In an effort to quell growing concerns about the ""Solar System"" feature's impact on teen mental health, Snapchat turns it off by default for subscribers while still allowing enabling. Snapchat SolarSystem MentalHealth","Title: Snapchat Adjusts ""Solar System"" Feature to Address Users' Concerns

In response to growing concerns about the impact of Snapchat's ""Solar System"" feature on teenagers' mental health, the company has decided to make adjustments rather than removing it entirely. This article will delve into the changes implemented and the implications for Snapchat users.

Snapchat's ""Solar System"" feature, which ranks a user's friends based on their communication frequency, was reported to exacerbate anxiety and self-esteem issues among teenagers. In light of the feedback, Snapchat has altered the feature's functionality, turning it off by default for Snapchat+ subscribers while still allowing them to enable it if desired.

The company acknowledged the mixed feelings associated with such a feature, stating, ""Weâ€™ve heard and understand that the Solar System can make that feeling worse, and we want to avoid that."" By turning off the feature by default, Snapchat aims to strike a balance between providing a requested feature and avoiding unnecessary distress for users who do not wish to participate.

However, this change might not entirely address the issue, as teenagers who find value in the feature will likely search for and enable the option. Although Snapchat argues that only a small percentage of the community uses this feature (less than 0.25%), it is essential to consider the percentage of Snapchat+ users who have engaged with the ""Solar System"" option.

Snapchat's defense of the feature is that users want to gain more insight into their friendships, and the ""Solar System"" provides additional awareness and context. Nevertheless, critics argue that the feature is merely a tool to keep young people engaged with the app, exploiting the importance of social hierarchy within their demographic.

The ""Solar System"" is not Snapchat's only friend ranking system. A private feature, ""Best Friends,"" places the most frequently communicated contacts at the top of a user's contact list, accompanied by a heart or smiley emoji.

Introduction

Autism affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, according to the CDC. The earlier a child receives an autism diagnosis, the better their developmental outcome will be. EarliTec Diagnostics, an Atlanta-based startup, is at the forefront of this issue. They recently raised $21.5 million in a Series B round to expand their groundbreaking diagnostic system, which uses AI to help clinicians diagnose children as young as 16 months old.

Revolutionizing Autism Diagnosis

EarliTec Diagnostics' FDA-authorized approach involves having a child watch short videos and social interactions on a screen for 12 minutes. The device then tracks the child's eye movements, analyzing how they focus on the content. Children with autism will not focus on the video in the same way as neurotypical kids. This innovative method allows for a faster, more reliable diagnosis, which can lead to earlier interventions and better developmental outcomes.

A Growing Wave of Support

EarliTec Diagnostics' recent funding round was co-led by Nexus NeuroTech Ventures, a venture firm focused on brain disorders, and Venture Investors, a Midwestern venture fund that invests in healthcare companies. This investment signals a growing wave of support for autism-focused healthcare startups. EarliTec's technology is currently used by eight clinicians across six states, and the company plans to use the new funds to expand its commercialization and research potential diagnoses for a wider age range.

The Power of Awareness

The increased interest in autism-focused healthcare startups can be attributed to a better understanding of the condition's prevalence. In recent years, autism awareness campaigns have led to a shift in public perception, and more accurate data on its prevalenceâ€”now at 1 in 36 children, up from 1 in 1,000 just a few years ago. This shift has helped investors see the total addressable market and opportunity, making it an attractive area for investment.

The US Green Bank Sparks $160B in Climate Tech Investments

A $20B EPA grant from the Inflation Reduction Act targets climate projects, aiming to stimulate over $160 billion in capital for climate technology, with a focus on underserved communities. Green bank loans have a successful track record and are projected to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar disbursed. The US climate tech sector requires $27T by 2050, with the green bank promising to amplify its impact beyond the initial $20B allocation.","Title: The New US Green Bank: A Game-Changer for Climate Tech

A significant development in the realm of climate technology finance has emerged in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently allocated $20 billion in grants, originating from the Inflation Reduction Act, to eight organizations. These organizations will utilize the funds to issue loans, targeting underfunded yet critical projects such as residential heat pump installations and affordable housing renovations.

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, as it is officially known, aims to stimulate over $160 billion in capital for climate technology, with a particular focus on underserved communities. Dawn Lippert, CEO of Elemental Excelerator, expressed her enthusiasm to TechCrunch, stating, ""It's a chance to prove that this works and creates real benefit on the ground for people across America...tribal communities, rural communities, low-income and disadvantaged communities are really the focus here."" Indeed, more than $14 billion of the funding will be directed towards these communities.

Green bank loans have demonstrated a strong track record of success. The Connecticut Green Bank, for instance, maintains a delinquency rate comparable to other commercial lenders across both residential and commercial portfolios. Furthermore, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is anticipated to draw in $7 in private capital for every dollar disbursed. This figure could potentially be higher, as McKinsey estimates the new green bank could attract over $12 of private investment per dollar on its balance sheet.

The US climate tech sector is projected to require $27 trillion by 2050 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. While the $20 billion green bank allocation may seem modest in comparison, its capacity to stimulate private investment and serve as a recurring funding source, rather than a one-time grant, promises to amplify its impact beyond the initial sum.

Entrepreneurs and investors stand to gain from this initiative as well. Although the funding primarily supports consumers and small businesses, equity investments remain a possibility. The influx of funding should also bolster demand for commercially viable climate technologies. For those solutions not yet ready for deployment, the green bank's loans will generate a ripple effect.

","Title: Tesla's Robotaxi Set to Launch Amidst Speculations of Affordable EV Discontinuation

Introduction

Tesla, the innovative electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, is poised to unveil its much-anticipated robotaxi on August 8, as announced by CEO Elon Musk. This announcement follows a Reuters report suggesting that Tesla has abandoned its plans to develop a low-cost EV, a claim that Musk vehemently denied. This article delves into the implications of these developments and what they mean for the future of Tesla and the EV industry.

The Robotaxi Unveiling

Elon Musk, through his Twitter account, confirmed Tesla's plan to introduce a robotaxi on August 8. This announcement came just hours after Reuters published a report stating that Tesla was abandoning its plans for an affordable EV. Musk, in response to the report, accused Reuters of lying, although he did not specify which part of the report he was disputing. It is likely that Musk was contesting the claim about the discontinuation of the low-cost EV, given his confirmation of the robotaxi unveiling.

Affordable EV or Not?

For years, Tesla has been promising an affordable EV, with prices expected to start at $25,000. Musk himself expressed optimism in January 2023 that the model would be available in the second half of 2025. However, the Reuters report suggests that these plans have been scrapped. Musk's denial of this claim leaves the future of the affordable EV uncertain.

The Current EV Landscape

Currently, Tesla's most affordable vehicle is the Model 3, with prices starting at $39,000. This is significantly higher than the proposed $25,000 for the affordable EV. The high cost of Tesla's vehicles has been a significant barrier to wider EV adoption, with many consumers viewing them as luxury items rather than practical alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered cars.

The Robotaxi and Autonomous Driving

The robotaxi is expected to be a significant step forward in autonomous driving technology. However, it is unclear how Tesla plans to make this work with its camera",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wj1nMikJyCc490.IeV0xSw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/6e512770-f3b0-11ee-bfbd-3b95bda82c17,2024-04-06 01:38:53,"Meta Description:
