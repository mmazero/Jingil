In response to this need, the UK and US governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a common approach for evaluating the safety of advanced AI models. The partnership between the UK's AI Safety Institute and its US counterpart will involve sharing technical knowledge, information, and personnel to assess the risks associated with these models, and to ensure their safety.

One of the initial goals of the partnership is to conduct a joint testing exercise on a publicly accessible model. This will provide valuable insights into the capabilities of these models and the potential risks they could pose. The UK's science minister, Michelle Donelan, stated that the partnership is essential, as they expect a new generation of AI models to emerge over the next year. These models have the potential to be complete game-changers, but their capabilities are still not fully understood.

The MoU represents the first bilateral arrangement on AI safety in the world. However, both the US and UK intend to collaborate with other countries in the future. The partnership is a significant step forward in addressing the risks associated with AI and ensuring that these systems are used for the benefit of society as a whole.

Governments around the world are also taking steps to regulate AI tools to keep them in check. In March, the White House signed an executive order that aims to ensure that federal agencies only use AI tools that do not endanger the rights and safety of American people. A few weeks before that, the European Parliament approved sweeping legislation to regulate artificial intelligence. The legislation will ban AI that manipulates human behavior or exploits people's vulnerabilities, biometric categorization systems based on sensitive characteristics, and untargeted scraping of faces from CCTV footage and the web to create facial recognition databases. Additionally, deepfakes and other AI-generated images, videos, and audio will need to be clearly labeled as such under its rules.

In conclusion, the partnership between the UK and US governments represents a significant step forward in addressing the risks associated with AI. The joint testing exercise and sharing of technical knowledge and information will provide valuable insights into the capabilities of AI models and the potential risks they could pose. Governments around the world are also taking steps to regulate AI tools, and it is essential that these systems are used for the benefit of society as a whole.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8jyyac4oXkPodApCJY.lOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/6bcc4f00-d2fb-11ee-bffe-937b9b40187d,2024-04-02 06:30:02, AI Safety: UK and US Sign MoU on AI Safety Evaluation , AI Safety ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

The White House recently announced that NASA should establish a new time standard for the Moon by 2026. This Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) will serve as an official reference for future lunar missions and help guide the US and other countries in their space race. The memo directs NASA to work with various government departments and international partners to plan and implement the new time zone.

Einstein's theories of relativity state that time changes relative to speed and gravity. Given the Moon's weaker gravity and movement differences from Earth, time moves slightly faster there. As the US and other countries plan to explore, research, and eventually build permanent Moon bases, using a single standard will help them synchronize technology and missions requiring precise timing. NASA space communications and navigation chief Kevin Coggins explained, ""The same clock that we have on Earth would move at a different rate on the moon. You're going to want a heartbeat on the moon.""

The White House wants LTC to coordinate with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the standard by which all of Earth's time zones are measured. The memo aims to enable accurate navigation and scientific endeavors while maintaining resilience if it loses contact with Earth and scalability for space environments beyond the Earth-Moon system.

NASA's Artemis program plans to send crewed missions back to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s. The space agency has announced that Artemis 2, which will fly around the Moon with four people onboard, is now set for a September 2025 launch. Artemis 3, which plans to put humans back on the Moon's surface, is now scheduled for 2026.

The US is not the only country with lunar ambitions. China aims to put astronauts on the Moon before 2030, making it the world's second foremost global superpower in space. India has already put a module and rover on the Moon's South Pole, while Russia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, and private companies have also shown lunar ambitions in recent years.

In addition to enabling further scientific exploration, technological establishment, and resource mining, the Moon could serve as a critical stop on the way to Mars. It could test technologies and provide fuel and supply needs for eventual human missions to the Red Planet.

The establishment of LTC will undoubtedly have a significant impact on space exploration and the future of the Moon and Mars. It will require careful planning, cooperation, and coordination among various government departments and international partners. However, if successfully executed, it will pave the way for a new era of space exploration and discovery.

Title: A Solar Cell Revolution: Selenium-Silicon Tandem Efficiency at 40%?","Title: Harnessing the Power of Selenium and Silicon: A Solar Cell Revolution

A recent study published in the journal PRX Energy brings promising news for the future of solar energy. A team of physicists and engineers at the Technical University of Denmark has successfully built a working selenium-silicon tandem solar cell, a combination that could theoretically boost the efficiency of solar cells to an impressive 40%. This development could significantly improve the way we harness solar energy and contribute to the fight against climate change.

Solar cells have become an essential part of our clean energy strategy, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is still room for improvement, as current solar cells capture only about 27% of the energy in sunlight, a figure close to the theoretical limit for this technology.

To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored the potential of combining different materials with varying photon-absorbing properties. This approach allows for the absorption of a wider range of wavelengths, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of solar cells.

The researchers in this study chose selenium, a semiconducting material once used to make solar cells before silicon emerged as the preferred material. Selenium's unique properties, such as its wide bandgap, make it an ideal candidate for creating a dual-material solar cell when combined with silicon.

The construction of the tandem cell involved creating a sandwich-like structure. A standard silicon base served as the foundation, followed by the addition of oxide layers, and topped off with a thin film of selenium. Exposing this innovative cell to sunlight resulted in the generation of 1.68 volts of electricity and a conversion efficiency of 2.7%.

The research team is optimistic about the potential of their tandem cell, believing that a tenfold increase in efficiency—up to approximately 40%—could be achieved with improved resistance, which would reduce voltage loss. Further refinements to the cell are expected to lead to this remarkable efficiency rating, making selenium-silicon tandem solar cells a game-changer in the solar energy industry.

This development offers hope for a more sustainable and eco-friendly future. With continued research and innovation, we can look forward to increasingly efficient solar cells that will help us harness the power of the sun like never before.

Apple's ambitious journey into the realm of technology has been marked by both groundbreaking successes and high-profile failures. One of its most recent setbacks was the abandonment of the Apple Car project, but the tech giant is already looking towards new horizons: home robots. This category, while riddled with challenges, presents a unique opportunity for Apple to revolutionize yet another industry.

The home robot market is a notoriously difficult one to crack. With the exception of the humble yet successful robot vacuum, which has seen continuous innovation since the introduction of the Roomba 22 years ago, there have been few other success stories. iRobot, the company behind Roomba, has attempted to replicate its success with gutter cleaners, pool cleaners, lawn mowers, and even garage floor debris removers. However, it has found the most success when focusing on its core product: the robot vacuum.

The key to the robot vacuum's success is its simplicity and singular focus on a single, in-demand task. Despite the efforts of well-funded startups like Matic, which aims to build upon the foundation of robot vacuums, the market remains dominated by this single product category. Matic's approach involves reimagining the form factor of robot vacuums, making them taller to improve their vantage point. This concept is similar to the periscope camera featured on Amazon's Astro home robot.

Home robot functionality is heavily influenced by form factor, and the hockey puck design prevalent in robot vacuums is not conducive to performing tasks beyond core functionality. To effectively perform more complex tasks, home robots require more sophisticated hardware. Mobile manipulators, which combine mobility with manipulation capabilities, are a promising solution. However, even industrial robotics has yet to fully crack the code on mobile manipulation, making it an even greater challenge for home robots.

Mobile manipulation is an essential component of home robots, and several companies are exploring humanoid form factors for this purpose. Hello Robot's Stretch is one such example, featuring an imaging system and an arm for grasping objects at different heights. However, Stretch's $24,950 price tag and teleoperated nature make it an","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180327_daisy_sl_batterycoolingbackviewbambam_001799-print.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-03 22:22:32,"Meta Description:

Introduction

In the world of animal locomotion, the abilities of certain creatures to move effortlessly on varied terrain have long inspired researchers in the field of robotics. Among these inspiring animals is the Chinese rice grasshopper (Oxya chinensis), which has demonstrated remarkable agility both on land and in water. A team of biologists, materials scientists, and bionics specialists, led by Professor Stanislav N. Gorb at Kiel University, has taken a keen interest in understanding and harnessing the unique abilities of this insect. In a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Gorb and his team delved into the aquatic acrobatics of the Chinese rice grasshopper, focusing on its ability to jump off the water surface at lightning speed.

The Grasshopper's Water Acrobatics

Grasshoppers, in general, are known for their exceptional jumping skills, thanks to their powerful hind legs. The Chinese rice grasshopper, however, has an additional party trick: it can jump off the water surface with remarkable speed and precision. This ability is particularly fascinating because it combines static and dynamic forces, allowing the insect to escape potential predators or unfavorable aquatic environments.

Gorb and his team set out to uncover the mechanisms behind the Chinese rice grasshopper's water acrobatics. By analyzing high-speed video footage of the insect in motion, they discovered that the grasshoppers employed a combination of hydrostatic pressure and hydrodynamics to support their body weight and propel themselves forward.

Hydrostatic Pressure and Hydrodynamics

Hydrostatic pressure refers to the pressure exerted by a fluid (in this case, water) on an immersed object. In the case of the Chinese rice grasshopper, its body weight is supported by the water pressure that increases with depth. This support is proportional to the mass of the grasshopper, allowing it to remain on the surface of the water without sinking.

Hydrodynamics, on the other hand, deals with the interaction between the grasshopper's limbs and the water. By moving its limbs at varying speeds, the grasshopper can generate forces that facilitate its water acrobat",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/new-robot-swims-and-ju.jpg,2024-04-02 10:39:35,"Meta Description:

The two governments have drafted a proposal in which government agencies will use AI to determine how manufacturers can remove polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) from the semiconductor manufacturing process. This initiative is part of broader negotiations at this week's US-EU Trade and Technology Council meetings in Belgium.

PFAS, also known as ""forever chemicals,"" have been used in the manufacturing process for years, but they're nearly impossible to break down and often show up in the products humans use and consume. PFAS have been found in nearly all tech devices, in the food humans eat, and even in their bodies, raising potential health risks. Furthermore, PFAS contribute to pollution around the globe.

The US and EU are concerned that China continues to invest heavily in the production of mature semiconductors that, while not powerful, are used heavily across industry and government applications. The West is reportedly worried that, absent new manufacturing processes, China could cement its position as the go-to for all mature chips, creating an even greater international security problem.

However, it's unclear from the US-EU statement how exactly the countries plan to use AI to combat the problem. The proposed plan also doesn't say how long it would take to address PFAS usage. Indeed, the US-EU statement is decidedly short on details.

Regardless, this partnership between the US and EU is a positive step towards addressing the harmful chemicals used in the semiconductor industry. With the help of AI, we can identify research cooperation opportunities on alternatives to the use of PFAS in chips. By working together, we can accelerate the discovery of suitable materials to replace PFAS in semiconductor manufacturing, reducing the potential health risks and environmental impact of these chemicals.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/75cb3f04376e89c4712855da0bb57423b4c34909/2024/04/03/7af06786-e7aa-4776-a896-e4bbf35bb42a/gettyimages-1939529904.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-03 00:00:00,AI to remove harmful chemicals from chips: US and EU team up.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scientists-ai-power-hungry.html,Computer scientists show the way: AI models need not be so power hungry, How to make AI models energy-efficient: study by computer scientists at the University of Copenhagen shows 70-80% energy savings can be achieved during training and deployment phase without compromising performance. ,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a significant increase in energy consumption, with AI servers expected to consume as much energy as countries like Argentina or Sweden by 2027. However, the focus on developing energy-efficient and environmentally friendly AI models is yet to become a priority in the industry.

Computer science researchers at the University of Copenhagen, Assistant Professor Raghavendra Selvan and computer science student Pedram Bakhtiarifard, have demonstrated that it is possible to reduce a great deal of CO2 emissions without compromising the precision of an AI model. In their study, the researchers calculated how much energy it takes to train over 400,000 convolutional neural network (CNN) type AI models, and presented a benchmark collection of AI models that use less energy to solve a given task, while performing at approximately the same level.

The researchers found that by opting for other types of models or adjusting models, 70-80% energy savings can be achieved during the training and deployment phase, with only a 1% or less decrease in performance. This study shows that energy efficiency can be a fixed criterion when developing AI models for different tasks, just as it is standard in many other industries.

""If you put together a model that is energy efficient from the get-go, you reduce the carbon footprint in each phase of the model's 'life cycle,'"" says Selvan.

Biofilm is a significant problem in underwater environments, causing issues such as increased drag, corrosion, and the spread of non-native species. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have developed a solution to this problem using ultraviolet (UV) rays-emitting glass that can reduce biofilm growth by 98%.

The glass, treated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, was shown to be effective in reducing biofilm growth compared to untreated glass. The silica nanoparticle coating on the glass enables an evenly ""glowing"" surface that distributes UV radiation evenly on the surface. This technology can be used to disinfect transparent surfaces such as windows of ships, flotation spheres, and moored buoys, camera lenses and sensors for various applications. The team has received a provisional patent for their discovery, and they are excited to optimize their findings by testing long-term applications, assessing any environmental effects, and creating larger surface areas.

In this article, we will explore the science behind this innovative solution and its potential applications.

Biofilm: The Problem

Biofilm is a thin layer of microorganisms that forms on wet surfaces. It is a significant problem in underwater environments, where it can cause issues such as increased drag, corrosion, and the spread of non-native species. Biofilm can also fog up windows used for cameras and other sensing devices that rely on transparency.

Current solutions for dealing with biofilm rely on chemical agents like biocidal coatings to kill the organisms or non-stick coatings to prevent biofilms from attaching in the first place. However, these methods can have negative effects on the ecosystem and only last for a short duration.

UV-Emitting Glass: The Solution

To address the problem of biofilm, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst developed a biofilm-resistant glass using UVC radiation, the shortest and most effective at disinfecting wavelength of UV radiation. The glass treated with UV radiation had 98% less biofilm growth than the untreated glass.

The key to this technology is the silica nanoparticle coating on the glass. The UV LED is connected from the cross-section of the glass, and as UV enters the glass, it is scattered by light-scattering nanoparticles. The silica does not absorb the UV rays. The waves continue to bounce off the nanoparticles and through the glass interior, enabling an evenly ""glowing"" glass surface.

This technology can be used to disinfect transparent surfaces such as windows of ships, flotation spheres, and moored buoys, camera lenses and sensors for oceanographical, agricultural, and water treatment applications.

Applications and Future Directions

The potential applications for UV-emitting glass are vast. It can be used to disinfect surfaces in various industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and water treatment. It can also be used to create self-disinfecting surfaces in public places, such as door handles and countertops.

Introduction

Imagine a wind turbine, and you'll likely envision the familiar windmill design, known as a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). However, the first wind turbines, developed in the Middle East around the 8th century for grinding grain, were vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT). Despite their potential advantages, such as reduced noise, greater wind energy density, and increased wildlife-friendliness, VAWTs have been largely absent from today's wind energy market. This is primarily due to an engineering problem related to air flow control, which researcher Sébastien Le Fouest and his team at the School of Engineering Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Lab (UNFOLD) believe can be solved through sensor technology and machine learning.

The Challenges of VAWTs and a Potential Solution

The primary challenge with VAWTs lies in their vertical axis of rotation, causing the blades to constantly change orientation with respect to the wind. This leads to a phenomenon called dynamic stall, where a strong gust increases the angle between the air flow and the blade, forming vortices that create transient structural loads the blades cannot withstand.

To tackle this issue, Le Fouest and his team mounted sensors onto an actuating blade shaft to measure the air forces acting on it. By pitching the blade back and forth at different angles, speeds, and amplitudes, they generated series of ""pitch profiles."" A computer then ran a genetic algorithm, performing over 3,500 experimental iterations and selecting the most efficient and robust pitch profiles. This approach not only identified two pitch profile series contributing to significantly enhanced turbine efficiency and robustness but also turned the biggest weakness of VAWTs into a strength.

Dynamic stall, which typically destroys wind turbines, can be harnessed at a smaller scale to propel the blade forward. By redirecting the blade pitch forward, the researchers created a second region of power production downwind. This innovative air flow control method has the potential to bring efficient and reliable VAWT technology to maturity, making it commercially available.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-magnetic-fields-boosts-electrocatalysis-sustainable.html,Study shows magnetic fields boosts electrocatalysis for sustainable fuel production, Magnetic fields boost electrocatalysis for sustainable fuel production - EPFL study ,"Introduction:

In recent years, the world has become increasingly concerned about the impact of climate change, which is largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels. To combat this, scientists and researchers are constantly exploring new ways to produce clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. one such way is through the use of electrocatalysis, which is a process that allows us to convert chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa.

The Problem with Traditional Electrocatalysis Methods:

While electrocatalysis is a powerful tool, it often falls short of achieving maximum efficiency. This is because traditional methods tend to limit the transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface, which is a crucial step in energy conversion. This results in a lower overall reaction efficiency and slows down our progress towards clean energy solutions.

Solution:

A team of researchers led by Magalí Lingenfelder at EPFL has developed a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of clean fuel production through electrocatalysis. They have used magnetic fields in combination with traditional catalysts to create Lorentz forces, which induce whirling motions that enhance the transport of reactants and products at the catalyst surface. This results in a more consistent and rapid reaction, but also overcomes the limitations posed by reactant scarcity, a common hurdle in reactions like the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), critical for fuel cells.

The Research:

The study involved the construction of a magneto-electrochemical setup that allowed the researchers to observe the movement of ions in real-time under a magnetic field. This setup was used to track the fundamental processes that enhance the efficiency of clean fuel production. The results showed that surrounding the catalysts with magnetic fields created Lorentz forces, which induced whirling motions that enhanced the transport of reactants and products at the catalyst surface.

The Impact:

The new method showed a more than 50% boost in activity for the oxygen reduction reaction induced by magnetic fields on non-magnetic interfaces. This represents a substantial jump in efficiency and allowed the team to resolve many fundamental controversies in the field by demonstrating the mechanisms and conditions needed for magnetic fields to enhance different electrocatalytic reactions involving gas products or reactants like hydrogen and oxygen.

Conclusion:

The new approach to electrocatalysis using magnetic fields is a promising avenue for advancing sustainable energy technologies. The method can revolutionize energy conversion technologies, make fuel cells more widely adopted, and increase the production of hydrogen as a clean energy source, thereby mitigating the impact of climate change.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/study-shows-magnetic-f-1.jpg,2024-04-03 12:38:07,"Optimized Meta Description:

Introduction:

Imagine a world where windows not only welcome natural light but also block out the intense heat generated by ultraviolet and infrared light, regardless of the sun's angle. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame have made this a reality by developing a groundbreaking window coating that significantly reduces air-conditioning cooling costs in hot climates. This innovative coating, which harnesses the power of quantum computing and active learning, promises to transform the way we manage energy consumption in buildings and automobiles.

The Challenge of Angle-Dependent Solar Radiation:

Traditional window coatings are optimized for light that enters a room at a 90-degree angle. However, during the hottest times of the day, the sun's rays often strike windows at oblique angles, rendering these coatings less effective. This inconsistency in performance inspired Tengfei Luo, the Dorini Family Professor for Energy Studies at the University of Notre Dame, and his team to develop a window coating that could maintain functionality and efficiency at any sun position.

Creating the Optimal Coating:

Luo and his postdoctoral associate, Seongmin Kim, initially fabricated a transparent window coating by stacking ultra-thin layers of silica, alumina, and titanium oxide on a glass base. They then added a micrometer-thick silicon polymer to enhance the structure's cooling power by reflecting thermal radiation through the atmospheric window and into outer space.

To optimize the coating for various angles of solar light, the researchers turned to quantum computing and, more specifically, quantum annealing. This advanced technology helped them determine the optimal configuration for the layers, allowing the coating to maximize visible light transmission while minimizing heat-producing wavelengths.

The resulting coating maintained transparency and reduced temperature by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees Celsius (about 9.7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in a model room, even when light was transmitted in a broad range of angles.

In the quest for sustainable energy solutions, a groundbreaking study has uncovered a novel method to enhance the efficiency of energy harvesting through the use of reconfigurable elastic metasurfaces. This innovation, published in Advanced Science, offers immense potential for harnessing elastic wave energy and transforming it into electrical power.

Elastic metamaterials, artificial structures engineered to manipulate wave energy, have traditionally been limited by their inability to adapt to various frequencies. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which is commonly used in their theoretical analysis, fails to account for fundamental elasticity characteristics such as shear deformation and rotational inertia effects. This shortcoming has confined metamaterials to single-frequency operation, thereby limiting their practical applications.

To tackle this challenge, a research team led by Professor Junsuk Rho from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and Professor Miso Kim from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) applied the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory, which takes into account the aforementioned elasticity factors. This marks the first instance of this theory being utilized in elastic metamaterial research.

The team's reconfigurable elastic metasurface, known as the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam-based reconfigurable elastic metasurface (TREM), can attach and detach multiple structures, allowing it to reconstruct its surface for various applications. This adaptability enables the TREM to control a wide range of wave phenomena, including anomalous wave refraction, wave focusing, self-accelerated wave propagation, and total wave reflection.

The TREM's versatility extends to energy harvesting, where it has demonstrated a remarkable increase in electrical output power for piezoelectric components. The team reported an enhancement of up to eight times, underscoring the TREM's potential as a highly efficient piezoelectric energy harvesting system.

(This SEO title is 49 characters long, including spaces, and captures the essence of the breakthrough while incorporating relevant keywords for search engine optimization.)","Title: Microsoft and Quantinuum Unveil a Major Breakthrough in Quantum Computing

Introduction

The world of quantum computing has long been captivated by the tantalizing possibility of building machines capable of executing complex calculations at exponentially faster rates than classical computers. Although IBM, Google, and other industry leaders have made significant strides in developing quantum computing hardware, these systems have yet to be employed for any practical purposes. This scenario may soon change, thanks to a groundbreaking announcement from Microsoft and Quantinuum, who claim to have developed the most reliable quantum computing system to date.

The Challenge of Quantum Computing

Classical computers and electronics rely on binary bits as their fundamental units of information, which can be either on or off. Quantum computers, however, utilize qubits, which can exist in a superposition of two states simultaneously, offering unparralleled computational power. The primary issue with qubits is that they are susceptible to errors, which is why today's quantum computers, known as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, are mainly used for research and experimentation.

Microsoft's Innovative Solution

Microsoft's approach to addressing this challenge involved grouping physical qubits into virtual qubits, enabling error diagnostics and correction without destroying them. This process was executed using Quantinuum's hardware, resulting in an error rate that was 800 times better than relying on physical qubits alone. Microsoft boasts that it managed to carry out over 14,000 experiments without encountering any errors.

The Path to Practical Quantum Computing

Jason Zander, Executive Vice President of Microsoft's Strategic Missions and Technologies division, believes that this achievement could pave the way for Level 2 Resilient quantum computing, which would be reliable enough for practical applications. Microsoft's long-term goal is to transition from physical qubits to reliable logical qubits, created by combining multiple physical qubits to protect against errors and sustain lengthy calculations.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-apple-harder.html,"Keeping your data from Apple is harder than expected, finds study", Protecting Your Privacy When Setting Up a MacBook ,"Cleaned and Rewritten Instructions:

Setting up a new device can be a daunting task for many users. From purchasing a new device to configuring its settings, the process can be quite complex. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on the steps required to set up a MacBook running macOS 10.15+, highlighting the data handling processes involved at various stages of the setup process.

The setup process for a MacBook involves several steps, from installing the operating system to configuring the privacy settings. While the process may seem straightforward, there are several data handling procedures that occur during the setup process, including the location of the information stored and the collection of personal information.

One of the most significant data handling procedures involved in the setup process is the collection of personal information. While Apple's official privacy policy statement [3] outlines examples of personal information collection at various stages of the setup process, users may not be aware of the extent of this data collection.

For instance, users' fingerprints are stored locally on the device, and the location of the information stored may vary depending on the device. It's essential to note that there may be slight variations between the order of the presentations of these settings in iOS and macOS. Additionally, Siri (step 15) is not prompted during device setup in iPhone (iOS 14.0).

To ensure that users' privacy is protected, it's crucial to understand the privacy settings of Apple's default apps, which are an integral part of the platform and ecosystem. The researchers at Aalto University have recently investigated the privacy settings of Apple's default apps, including apps such as Safari, Siri, Family Sharing, iMessage, FaceTime, Location Services, Find My, and Touch ID.

The study found that the fragility of the privacy protections was surprising. Due to the way the user interface is designed, users often don't know what is going on, and there are no clear directions on how to go about restricting data access. Participants in the study were unable to stop data sharing in any of the apps, and finding and adjusting privacy settings took a lot of time, with no feedback on whether the changes were successful.

The study also demonstrated that the instructions for restricting data access were complex and confusing, and the necessary steps were scattered in different places. The researchers also noted that the instructions didn't list all the necessary steps or explain how collected data was processed.

While Apple's help falls short, there are several ways users can protect their privacy on an Apple device. One way is to opt for a third-party service, which can provide more control over the data collected by default apps. Additionally, users can try to understand the privacy settings of each app and make adjustments accordingly.

In conclusion, setting up a new device can be a complex process, and users must be aware of the data handling procedures involved at various stages of the setup process. While Apple's default apps are an integral part of the platform and ecosystem, users must understand the privacy settings of these apps to protect their privacy. By opting for third-party services and making adjustments to the privacy settings of each app, users can ensure that their data is protected while still enjoying the seamless multi-device interaction that Apple devices offer.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/keeping-your-data-from.jpg,2024-04-03 13:44:03,"Optimized Meta Description:

In December 2020, the company announced a subscription-based option to continue receiving security updates for Windows 10 after October 14, 2025, similar to the program they ran for Windows 7. Now, Microsoft has revealed the pricing of the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program for business customers. The cost of the ESU program is a subscription, with the first year costing $61 and doubling for the second and third years. For education customers, the price for the first year is $1, doubling to $2 in the second year and $4 in the third year, for a total of $7. The rules for ESUs are the same as before, and the program does not include new features, non-security fixes, or design change requests. Microsoft wants business customers to upgrade to Windows 11, which explains the high cost of the program. However, businesses that use Microsoft's official cloud-based update management services or Windows 365 can get a discount on the first year cost. The ESU program is not a long-term solution but a temporary bridge until businesses can upgrade to the latest version of Windows. Microsoft is better prepared for the ESU program this time around, and there will be a large number of PCs that will need support in 2025.

DCVC, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm with a proven track record of successful investments, recently launched its first climate-focused fund, Climate Select, with a target of $500 million. However, the fund’s target has been all over the place, highlighting the challenges of venture fundraising in recent years. In fact, DCVC’s year of fundraising brought in only $157 million of commitments by December 2022, prompting the firm to lower its target to $300 million in December 2023.

Now, sources familiar with the matter have revealed that $400 million may be a more accurate reflection of where the fund is headed. This revisited target is consistent with recent news of New Mexico State Investment Council’s (NMIC) $50 million commitment to the fund. NMIC has also confirmed that the GP presented a target of $400 million.

DCVC’s Climate Select Fund is targeting climate startups at the mid-stages, specifically those in the deep tech space. While this is DCVC’s first dedicated climate tech fund, the firm has invested $360 million from other funds into such startups over the past decade. This experience has given DCVC a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing the climate startup ecosystem.

The fundraising landscape for venture capital firms has been tumultuous in recent years, with 2022 setting a new fundraising record for US-based firms but also revealing the real effects of the global economic downturn. U.S. firms raised $66.9 billion in 2023, the lowest total since 2017 and a 61% decrease from the record-setting year prior.

Despite these challenges, climate investing remains a hot spot for venture capital, with climate-focused funds raising more than $710 million so far in 2024. This represents a significant increase from the $2.17 billion raised in 2023 and is not far off the record of $2.9 billion set in 2022. The demand for climate-related investments is driven by growing awareness of the urgent need to address climate change and the potential for innovative solutions to mitigate its effects.

DCVC’s Climate Select Fund is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, given its focus on mid-stage climate startups and its experience in deep tech investing. While the fund’s initial target of $500 million was a pro forma amount before it could take on money from LPs, the industry standard is that this number does represent a fund’s target. DCVC has adjusted its expectations to more “sober” market conditions, but the firm has also seen some wins entering 2024 that could be helping the fundraising journey.

One example of a successful investment is Twelve, a company that creates products traditionally made using fossil fuels from carbon. Twelve recently signed a 14-year purchase agreement with the International Airlines Group, which includes airlines like Aer Lingus and British Airways, to buy 260 million gallons of Twelve’s more sustainable aviation fuel. These are not small deals, and the financial performance of skeptical customers is a persuasive fact pattern.

DCVC’s Climate Select Fund is not the only fund to lower a target or hold a final close on less capital than expected after a challenging 2022 and 2023 fundraising cycle. However, the fundraising challenges have not deterred investors from focusing on climate-related investments. Climate investing remains a hot spot, attracting increasing attention and funding from venture capital firms.

In conclusion, while DCVC’s Climate Select Fund has faced some challenges in its fundraising journey, it remains well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for climate-related investments. The fund’s focus on mid-stage climate startups and its experience in deep tech investing give it a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing the climate startup ecosystem. As the demand for sustainable solutions continues to grow, DCVC’s Climate Select Fund is well-positioned to play a significant role in addressing the urgent need to combat climate change.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1186549350.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-03 21:45:12,"DCVC's Climate Select Fund: A Roller-Coaster Ride in the Amidst Challenges

In a revolutionary development, a new study from ESMT Berlin reveals the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage human participants in large-scale research projects. This technology can take over functions such as task allocation, coordination, and motivation, allowing research projects to operate at a larger scale and with greater efficiency.

Maximilian Koehler, a Ph.D. candidate at ESMT, and Henry Sauermann, professor of strategy at ESMT, explore the role of AI as a ""manager"" of human workers performing research tasks such as data collection and analysis. Algorithmic management (AM) proposes a significant shift in the way research projects are conducted and can enable projects to operate at a larger scale and with greater efficiency.

With the complexity and scope of scientific research rapidly increasing, the study, published in Research Policy, illustrates that AI can not only replicate but also potentially surpass human managers by leveraging its instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities.

Koehler and Sauermann investigate algorithmic management in crowd and citizen science, discussing examples of how AI effectively performs five important managerial functions: task division and allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning.

The researchers used a combination of online documents, interviews with organizers, AI developers, and project participants, and firsthand experience as participants to identify projects that use algorithmic management, understand how AI performs management functions, and explore when AM might be more effective.

The growing number of use cases suggests that the adoption of AM could be a critical factor in improving research productivity. ""The capabilities of artificial intelligence have reached a point where AI can now significantly enhance the scope and efficiency of scientific research by managing complex, large-scale projects,"" states Koehler.

In a quantitative comparison with a broader sample of projects, the study also reveals that AM-enabled projects are often larger than projects that do not use AM and are associated with platforms that provide access to shared AI tools. This suggests that AM may enable projects to scale but also requires technical infrastructures that stand-alone projects may find difficult to develop.

These patterns point towards changing sources of competitive advantage in research and may have important implications for research funders, digital research platforms, and larger research organizations such as universities or corporate R&D labs.

While AI can take over important management functions, this does not mean that principal investigators or human managers will become obsolete. Sauermann notes, ""If AI can take over some of the more algorithmic and mundane functions of management, human leaders could shift their attention to more strategic and social tasks such as identifying high-value research targets, raising funding, or building an effective organizational culture.""

In conclusion, the study highlights the potential of AI to revolutionize the way scientific research is conducted. As AI continues to advance, its adoption in research could be a critical factor in improving productivity and achieving greater efficiency and scale in large-scale research projects.

Introduction

Email clients are essential tools in today's digital world, enabling us to manage multiple accounts and streamline our communication. However, finding the perfect email client that caters to your needs and preferences can be challenging. In this blog post, we will explore the Proton Mail desktop client for Linux and discuss its unique features, benefits, and minor drawbacks.

The Proton Mail Desktop Client: A Modern and Intuitive Solution

I have tried various email clients on Linux, including Thunderbird, Evolution, Claws Mail, Geary, KMail, Mutt, Balsa, Pine, Slypheed, and Trojita. While some come close to meeting my requirements, each has its own set of issues. My quest for an email client that offers the right balance between features and modern design led me to the recently released Proton Mail desktop client for Linux.

Using Proton Mail with Your Domains

Proton Mail's desktop client requires a paid account, with plans starting at $3.99 per month. Although I do not frequently use my Proton email address, I decided to test the client using a new Proton email address during the 5-day trial period. To use my IMAP servers, I installed the Proton Bridge, which securely routes emails from my domains through the Proton servers.

First Impressions and Key Features

I was immediately impressed with Proton Mail's user interface, which is modern, clean, and user-friendly—a stark contrast to many Linux email clients. Key features of the Proton Mail desktop client include:

1. Scheduled sending of emails
2. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts
3. Easy folder and label management
4. Simple email filtering

Introduction

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, a pressing concern that has emerged is its environmental impact. A recent study published in Scientific Reports has revealed that AI, when tasked with writing and illustrating, emits hundreds of times less carbon than humans performing the same tasks. While AI systems like ChatGPT, Bloom AI, DALL-E2, and others prove to be more energy-efficient, it is essential to understand that this does not necessarily imply that AI should replace human writers and illustrators. This article delves into the details of the study, comparing the CO2e emissions of AI and human creators.

The Environmental Comparison: AI and Humans

The study, co-authored by Andrew Torrance, Paul E. Wilson Distinguished Professor of Law at KU, and colleagues from the University of California-Irvine, aimed to compare the environmental impact of AI systems and human creators. They found that AI systems emit between 130 and 1,500 times less CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per page of text generated than human writers. In terms of illustrations, AI systems emit between 310 and 2,900 times less CO2e per image than humans.

To estimate the carbon footprint of a human writer, researchers took into account the Energy Budget, which calculates the amount of energy used in certain tasks for a set period of time. By measuring the energy used by a computer with word processing software and the average time it takes a person to write a page of text, they arrived at an estimate. Using the same amount of energy used by the CPUs that operate AI systems, such as ChatGPT, allowed for a comparison of AI and human emissions.

The study also considered the per capita emissions of individuals in the United States and India, which are approximately 15 metric tons CO2e per year and 1.9 metric tons, respectively. These two countries were chosen as they represent the highest and lowest per capita environmental impact among countries with populations greater than 300 million.

Faraday Future, the electric vehicle (EV) startup, has managed to dodge eviction from its Los Angeles headquarters, at least for the time being. The company, which has been grappling with financial difficulties, reached an agreement with its landlord, Rexford Industrial, in early April. This agreement allows Faraday Future to remain in the building, provided it meets certain conditions. However, the future of the company remains uncertain as it continues to face significant financial challenges.

In accordance with the agreement, Faraday Future must adhere to specific terms to avoid eviction. If the company fails to comply with any of these terms, Rexford Industrial can issue a 48-hour notice demanding payment. Non-compliance will result in the startup being evicted from the premises. Should Faraday Future meet its financial obligations, it will be permitted to occupy the building until the lease expires in September 2025.

The recent agreement comes as Faraday Future faces yet another financial crisis. The company reported having only $8.5 million in cash as of September 2023, as revealed in a regulatory filing in early April. This disclosure was accompanied by the admission that the company had delayed payments to third-party audit consultants, causing it to be late in submitting its annual financial report for 2023.

Rexford Industrial's legal action against Faraday Future began in February when the landlord sued the startup for missing multiple lease payments, totaling close to $1 million. As part of the recent agreement, Faraday Future is required to pay $312,524.46 toward the outstanding amount by April 30. Additionally, the company must pay this month's rent of $305,617.08 by April 15 and the following month's rent of $312,419.63 by May 6.

Unfortunately, Faraday Future did not fare as well in a separate lawsuit filed in January by the landlord of its San Jose office space, BXP Realty. The lawsuit claimed that Faraday Future had ceased making lease payments in December 2023 and that the company owed $127","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/faraday-facilities-002.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-03 21:18:48," Meta Description: Faraday Future avoids eviction from LA HQ, but faces financial struggles and unpaid rent in San Jose.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/openai-backed-ghost-autonomy-shuts-down/,OpenAI-backed Ghost Autonomy shuts down, Ghost Autonomy Shuts Down after Raising Nearly $220 Million in Funding ,"Ghost Autonomy, a promising startup in the autonomous driving space, has announced its closure after raising nearly $220 million in funding. The company will shut down its operations worldwide and wind down the company as of Wednesday. Ghost Autonomy, which had a team of about 100 people, had its headquarters in Mountain View, Dallas, and Sydney.

In a statement on its website, the company's note reads, ""We are proud of the substantial technical innovations and progress the Ghost team made on its mission to deliver software-defined consumer autonomy. The path to long-term profitability was uncertain given the current funding climate and long-term investment required for autonomy development and commercialization. We are exploring potential long-term destinations for our team's innovations.""

Ghost Autonomy's shutdown comes just five months after partnering with OpenAI through the OpenAI Startup Fund to gain early access to OpenAI systems and Azure resources from Microsoft. The startup also received a $5 million investment from OpenAI. The company most recently closed a $55 million down round in 2021 that included early investors Keith Rabois at Founders Fund and Mike Speiser at Sutter Hill Ventures.

At the time, Ghost co-founder and CEO John Hayes touted the company's plans to explore the applications of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in self-driving. LLMs offer a new way to understand ""the long tail,"" adding reasoning to complex scenes where current models fall short. However, experts were skeptical of the approach.

Over the years, Ghost Autonomy has shifted its approach to autonomous vehicle technology. The startup, originally called Ghost Locomotion, was founded in 2017. The company made its public debut two years later with $63.7 million in total investment from Rabois of Founders Fund, Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures and Speiser at Sutter Hill Ventures, among others, and a plan to develop a kit that would allow privately owned passenger vehicles to drive autonomously on highways. The company said it would deliver that tech in 2020.

After the deadline came and went, Ghost raised another $100 million in 2021 with an altered plan to focus on crash prevention tech. The Series D funding round was led by Sutter Hill Ventures and the inclusion of Founders Fund and Coatue. Hayes told TechCrunch back in 2021 that the startup hadn't completely closed the door on the consumer kit model but had turned its attention to universal collision avoidance technology in an effort to get to market faster.

His premise was that an autonomous driving system didn't need to recognize and categorize objects prior to avoiding them. Instead, the company was tracking the movement of clusters of pixels in a scene. While most other autonomous systems identify an object and then use image localization to determine its size, distance and other relevant features, Hayes argued that this approach was faster and more accurate.

Hayes, who was reached via email on Wednesday, said the company had completed a highway driving product and was moving in urban environments through what he described as ""last-mile delivery.""

Harnessing the Power of Waves: A Revolutionary Blue Energy Harvesting Device

Waves are one of the most powerful natural forces on Earth, capable of generating immense energy that could be harnessed for a variety of purposes. While there have been some attempts to capture this energy, current ""blue energy"" harvesting devices have low energy output, making them impractical for large-scale applications. However, a new study published in ACS Energy Letters has shown that simply repositioning the electrode in a liquid-filled tube can significantly increase the amount of energy that can be harvested.

Researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China have developed an optimized liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that converts mechanical energy into electricity as water sloshes back and forth against the inside of the tube. By positioning the energy-collecting electrode at the end of the tube where the water crashes with the most force, the researchers were able to increase the device's energy harvesting ability by 2.4 times compared to conventional designs.

The new design improved upon the conventional TENG in several ways. First, the researchers used 16-inch clear plastic tubes to create two devices, with the first device featuring a copper foil electrode at the center of the tube. In the second device, they inserted a copper foil electrode at one end of the tube. They then filled the tubes a quarter of the way with water and sealed the ends. A wire connected the electrodes to an external circuit.

When placed on a benchtop, both devices generated electrical currents by converting mechanical energy into electricity. The optimized design generated a higher current output than the conventional design, as the friction from water hitting or sliding against the electrode was more efficient in converting mechanical energy into electrical current.

The researchers also demonstrated the potential of their optimized TENG for other applications, such as wireless underwater signaling communications. In one experiment, they blinked an array of 35 LEDs on and off as water entered the section of the tube covered by the electrode and then flowed away.

Overall, the study shows that optimizing the location of the energy-collecting electrode in a liquid-solid TENG can greatly enhance its energy harvesting ability, making it a promising candidate for large-scale blue energy harvesting from ocean waves. With further development and optimization, this technology could pave the way for a new era of clean and sustainable energy generation.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/zip-wants-to-modernize-enterprise-procurement/,Zip is trying to modernize enterprise procurement,Zip Premier: Streamline Enterprise Procurement with Intake and Procurement Orchestration Platform,"

Do you struggle with the complex and often frustrating process of procuring even the most basic supplies for your business? If so, you're not alone. The procurement process can be a nightmare for both employees and the procurement, finance, and legal teams responsible for managing it. That's where Zip comes in.

Zip is an Intake and Procurement Orchestration platform that simplifies and streamlines the procurement process by bringing together all the different steps involved in one platform. From the initial purchasing request to managing purchase policies, getting sign-off from financial, legal, and security teams, managing budgets, onboarding new vendors, creating purchase orders, and processing invoices, Zip makes it easy for businesses to manage the entire procurement process in one place.

But what sets Zip apart from other procurement platforms is its ability to integrate with third-party tools used by businesses for different steps in the procurement process. This means that companies can continue to use the tools they already have in place, while Zip aggregates the data and manages the overall workflow.

Today, Zip is announcing Zip Premier, a set of new enterprise capabilities that make it even easier for businesses to manage their procurement process. These capabilities include more granular permissions, new tools for maintaining audit trails, real-time alerts for when integrations go awry, and a new low-code integration platform that allows users to build their own integrations for services that Zip itself doesn't support.

One of the biggest challenges faced by businesses is managing the health of their integrations with third-party services. Zip's new low-code integration platform aims to make it easier for businesses to build and maintain these connectors, which often tie into legacy or bespoke systems that Zip itself couldn't support.

Zip is going up against several other procurement platforms from companies like Coupa, SAP, and Workday. However, Zaparde argues that Zip's advantage is that it can tie all of these systems together, making it easier for businesses to manage their procurement process in one place.

""The problem is very horizontal and ubiquitous because this issue of an employee needing to buy something to do their jobs is very common across industries,"" Zaparde said. ""The problems get more painful the larger a company becomes, and even more so when it's an enterprise in a regulated industry.""

Zip Premier is an exciting new offering that will help businesses streamline their procurement process and make it easier to manage their spending. With its new capabilities, businesses can focus on what they do best - growing their business and achieving their goals.
