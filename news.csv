https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/28/hydrogens-real-markets/, Toyota Offers Incentives for Mirai Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle ,"

Hydrogen Fuel Cells: A Miraculous Deal or a Mirage?

Imagine getting a brand-new Toyota Mirai for a mere $3,000! That's the tantalizing offer Toyota is dangling before us, with a $40,000 discount on its 2023 hydrogen-powered car. Throw in free hydrogen worth $15,000 over six years and an interest-free loan, and the company is practically begging you to take this car off its hands.

But hold your horses! Before you jump at this seemingly incredible deal, let's delve into the reality of hydrogen fuel cells.

The Hydrogen Catch-22

The catch lies in the fuel itself. Toyota's aggressive discounts come on the heels of Shell closing its California hydrogen filling stations, reducing the already scarce infrastructure by over 10%. This means that finding hydrogen to power your Mirai could be a logistical nightmare, especially outside of major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The Honda Conundrum

Honda, undeterred by the hydrogen infrastructure challenges, has recently launched a Frankenstein-like hybrid: the CR-V plug-in fuel-cell vehicle. It combines a battery for limited electric range with a hydrogen fuel cell for extended mileage. However, this complexity comes at a cost, yielding a range of just 270 miles, comparable to a mid-tier electric crossover. But unlike EVs, the CR-V's range is severely limited by the availability of hydrogen filling stations.

Hydrogen's Potential and Pitfalls

Hydrogen has immense potential as a clean fuel source for industries like steel production and long-distance shipping. However, its use in passenger vehicles faces significant hurdles. Hydrogen production and distribution are still too spotty, and fuel cells are expensive. Moreover, to truly reduce carbon emissions, FCEVs must run on green hydrogen, which is currently scarce. Until then, they offer only marginal environmental benefits over advanced hybrids.

Automakers' Hydrogen Obsession

Despite the challenges, Toyota, Honda, and other automakers remain bullish on hydrogen. Why? The cynical view is that they're buying time, hoping to delay the transition to EVs by promoting hydrogen's advantages (like fast fueling) while continuing to sell fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.

A more charitable view suggests that automakers are simply stuck in their ways. Fuel cells align with their existing engineering expertise, and they may fear that consumers won't embrace EVs due to longer charging times.

The Future of Hydrogen

Whether automakers' hydrogen gambit will pay off remains to be seen. If hydrogen startups can scale up production and make green hydrogen widely available, it might make sense to introduce FCEVs to the masses. But for now, this future seems distant.

Conclusion

Toyota's Mirai deal may seem too good to pass up, but it's essential to consider the limited hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen fuel cells have potential, but they face significant challenges in the passenger vehicle market. Until these challenges are overcome, EVs remain the more practical and environmentally friendly choice for zero-emission transportation.

Apple's interest in the automotive industry began in 2013, when they reportedly met with Tesla's Elon Musk. Around the same time, Tesla poached Apple's Doug Field, a key figure in hardware design.

Project Titan: A Shrouded Beginning

In 2014, Apple officially launched Project Titan, hiring talent from automakers like Ford and Mercedes-Benz. Led by Steve Zadesky, the team operated off-site, fueling speculation about Apple's automotive ambitions.

The Media Frenzy: Rumors and Glimmers

In 2015, Project Titan became public knowledge. Reports emerged of Apple working on an electric vehicle and exploring self-driving technology. The hunt for more information intensified, with Apple hiring designer Marc Newson, who had previously created a concept car for Ford.

The Pivots: Electric, Autonomous, or Both?

Apple's automotive vision remained elusive. The company vacillated between chasing an electric vehicle, a self-driving car, or a combination of both. This indecision plagued the project, leading to setbacks and team changes.

The Rise and Fall of Momentum

In 2016, Jony Ive expressed dissatisfaction with the progress, and hiring slowed. Zadesky left the project, and the team faced challenges in defining clear goals. Despite a target ship date of 2019, momentum began to falter.

The Self-Driving Focus: A New Direction

In 2017, Apple shifted its focus to developing an autonomous driving system. They received a permit to test self-driving technology, and Tim Cook confirmed the automotive project, emphasizing the importance of autonomy.

The Resurgence: Doug Field's Return and Tesla's Shadow

In 2018, Apple re-hired Doug Field from Tesla, sparking speculation about a renewed push for an Apple-built car. Musk revealed that he had attempted to sell Tesla to Apple during its financial struggles.

The Cuts and Restructuring: A Scaling Back

2019 brought another round of cuts and restructuring, with over 200 workers laid off. Apple acquired Drive.ai, a self-driving startup, but scaled back its test fleet.

The Pandemic Pause and Renewed Ambitions

The COVID-19 pandemic slowed down Project Titan's progress, but Apple resumed discussions with EV startup Canoo in 2020. They also hired Tesla's VP of engineering to bolster the team.

The Electric-Autonomous Convergence: A Breakthrough Battery

In 2021, Apple reportedly planned to build an electric vehicle with ""breakthrough battery technology"" that would also be autonomous. The team aimed to produce this new model by 2024.

The Partnership Dance: Hyundai, Kia, and Beyond

Apple engaged in talks with Hyundai and Kia about manufacturing the Apple Car. However, the partnership negotiations ultimately fell through, and Apple decided to go it alone.

The Full Self-Driving Pivot: A Bold Ambition

In 2021, Apple reportedly refocused the project on ""full self-driving capabilities."" They aimed to create a car that could drive itself completely, without a steering wheel or pedals, by 2025.

The Scaling Back: A More Realistic Approach

In 2022, Apple realized the challenges of a fully autonomous vehicle and scaled back its ambitions. They pivoted to a car that would only be autonomous on highways, with a target date of 2026.

The End of an Era: Project Titan Killed

Despite years of effort and billions invested, Apple announced the end of Project Titan in 2023. The project had faced numerous challenges, from technical difficulties to strategic shifts.

Lessons Learned: The Path Not Taken

Apple's Project Titan serves as a reminder that even the most ambitious projects can face setbacks and pivots. It highlights the challenges of entering new industries, the need for clear goals, and the importance of adapting to changing circumstances.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/28/substack-gets-more-social-with-the-launch-of-dms/, Substack's Social Expansion: Introducing Direct Messaging ,"

Substack's Social Media Metamorphosis: Embracing Direct Messaging

Substack, the popular newsletter platform, has taken a significant step towards becoming a full-fledged social network with the introduction of direct messaging (DMs). This new feature allows users to engage in private one-on-one conversations within the Substack app and website.

A Shift Towards Social Connectivity

Substack's transformation into a social hub has been gradual but steady. Last year, the platform launched Notes, a Twitter-like feature that enabled users to follow each other and share short updates. Now, with the addition of DMs, Substack has further blurred the lines between a newsletter platform and a social media platform.

Meeting User Demand

Substack's decision to introduce DMs was driven by popular demand. Many users had expressed a desire for a private communication channel within the platform. Substack believes that DMs will enhance the connections between writers and readers, fostering a sense of community.

Customizable Privacy Settings

To ensure user privacy, Substack has implemented customizable privacy settings. By default, users will only receive DMs from people they are connected to. Other messages will be sent to a Requests folder, where users can choose to accept or reject them. For those who prefer to limit direct contact, the option to disable DMs is available in the settings.

Encouraging Reader Engagement

Writers can leverage DMs to build stronger relationships with their subscribers. By adding a ""Send a message"" button to new posts, writers can encourage readers to share news tips, ask questions, or provide feedback. This direct line of communication can foster a sense of involvement and loyalty among readers.

A Controversial Journey

Substack's recent introduction of DMs comes amidst a controversial period for the platform. The company's decision not to ban Nazi newsletters sparked a backlash, leading to the departure of several prominent writers. Despite the criticism, Substack remains committed to its decentralized approach to content moderation.

Conclusion

Substack's embrace of direct messaging is a testament to its ongoing evolution as a platform. As it continues to expand its social media features, Substack is positioning itself as a hub for both content creation and community engagement. Whether this transformation will be embraced by all users remains to be seen, but it is clear that Substack is determined to reshape the landscape of online publishing and connection.

Snowflake's CEO Shakeup: A Tale of Surprises and Stock Plunge

In a surprising turn of events, Snowflake's CEO, Frank Slootman, has announced his departure, sending shockwaves through the tech world. Investors reacted swiftly, with the company's stock price plummeting over 20% in after-hours trading.

Slootman, a seasoned tech executive, has been at the helm of Snowflake since 2019, guiding the company through its successful IPO. He will now step back into the role of Chairman of the Board, while Sridhar Ramaswamy, formerly of Google Ads, will take over as CEO.

While the executive shuffle dominated the headlines, Snowflake's earnings report was overshadowed. The company reported a solid 33% year-over-year revenue growth to $738 million, with guidance for the next quarter projecting a respectable 26-27% growth.

Slootman's tenure at Snowflake was marked by his outspoken personality and generous compensation. His base salary of $375,000 was complemented by a lucrative stock option package, reportedly earning him a staggering $95 million monthly at one point.

Despite his financial success, Slootman courted controversy in 2021 with comments suggesting that diversity should not take precedence over merit. He later retracted these remarks after facing backlash from the tech community.

Prior to joining Snowflake, Slootman had a successful stint as Chairman and CEO of ServiceNow. With his substantial wealth, it remains to be seen whether he will retire or pursue other ventures.

As the dust settles on this executive shakeup, investors will be closely monitoring Snowflake's performance under its new leadership. The company's strong growth trajectory and Ramaswamy's experience in AI technology suggest a bright future, but only time will tell if the stock price will recover from this sudden drop.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/28/leaked-documents-techstars-lost-7-million-2023-layoffs-enough-cash/, Leaked Documents Reveal Techstars' $7M Loss and Ample Cash ,"

Techstars: Financial Woes and Strategic Overhaul

Techstars, a renowned accelerator for startups, has faced financial challenges in 2023, leading to significant cuts in its programs and staff. Internal documents obtained by TechCrunch shed light on the company's financial performance and the reasons behind its recent restructuring.

Missed Revenue Targets and Rising Costs

The documents reveal that Techstars missed its revenue goals for 2023, falling short by a substantial $15 million. This shortfall, coupled with higher-than-anticipated costs, resulted in a significant loss of $7.2 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA).

Accelerator Expansion and Expenses

Despite the financial headwinds, Techstars expanded its accelerator programs in 2023, operating an average of 54 active programs. However, these programs failed to generate sufficient revenue to offset the company's expenses.

Program expenses amounted to $34.3 million, while operating expenses reached $53.5 million. The company had initially budgeted for higher expenses, but cost-cutting measures, including the closure of accelerators in Boulder, Seattle, and Austin, helped reduce spending.

Cash Cushion and Future Prospects

Despite the financial challenges, Techstars maintained a healthy cash balance of $48.7 million at the end of 2023. This provides a buffer for the company as it implements its restructuring plan, dubbed ""Techstars 2.0.""

However, sources have expressed concerns that the company's cash reserves may not be sufficient to sustain its operations beyond 2024. Techstars' parent company, however, is well-capitalized, suggesting that additional funding may be available if needed.

Strategic Realignment

Techstars' restructuring aims to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The company has laid off 7% of its staff and is exploring further program closures. These measures are designed to align the company's operations with its revenue streams.

The company's long-term strategic choices, such as which programs to discontinue, remain under scrutiny. However, the financial data suggests that Techstars' decision to retrench and rebuild was a necessary step to ensure its financial stability.

Conclusion

The financial challenges faced by Techstars in 2023 underscore the impact of economic headwinds on the startup ecosystem. The company's response, including cost-cutting measures and strategic realignment, demonstrates its commitment to adapting to the evolving landscape. While the future holds uncertainties, Techstars' strong cash position and the support of its parent company provide a foundation for its continued operations and potential recovery.

The Great Eclipse Glasses Shortage: A Looming Concern

As the highly anticipated total solar eclipse of April 8th approaches, a critical concern has emerged: a potential shortage of safe eclipse glasses. This shortage stems from an unprecedented surge in demand, with over 32 million people expected to be within the path of totality.

The Perfect Storm of Supply and Demand

Eclipses, by nature, are events that garner widespread attention only in the weeks or days leading up to them. This creates a perfect storm of supply and demand, where the sudden influx of buyers overwhelms the production capacity of manufacturers.

Major eclipse glass producers, such as Rainbow Symphony and American Paper Optics, have been working around the clock to meet the demand. American Paper Optics alone has increased production by 400% in recent months, employing additional staff and running extra shifts.

Price Hikes and Reselling

The increased production costs, coupled with rising paper prices, have led to higher unit costs for eclipse glasses. As the eclipse date nears, the market has become ripe for resellers, who are selling glasses at inflated prices.

While companies are advised against price gouging, it remains a common practice during the pre-eclipse period. Consumers should be wary of such practices and purchase their glasses from reputable sources.

Last-Minute Surge and Chinese Imports

In the weeks leading up to the 2017 eclipse, American Paper Optics experienced a surge in orders, with people driving for hours to purchase glasses. This year, while demand is not as intense, experts still anticipate a shortage of ISO-certified eclipse glasses made in the United States.

To fill the gap, companies in China have been producing and exporting eclipse glasses that meet the ISO standard. However, concerns have been raised about the quality of solar film used in these glasses.

Trustworthy Sources

Navigating the Maze of Narcissism: The Gray Rock Method

Introduction

In the realm of human interactions, narcissists stand out as masters of manipulation and emotional vampirism. Their insatiable need for admiration and lack of empathy can leave us feeling drained and bewildered. Whether it's a coworker, family member, or romantic partner, dealing with a narcissist can be a daunting task. But fear not, for there's a strategy that can help you navigate this treacherous terrain: the Gray Rock Method.

What is the Gray Rock Method?

The Gray Rock Method is a technique that aims to neutralize the impact of narcissistic behavior by becoming emotionally unresponsive. It's like turning yourself into a dull and uninteresting gray rock, devoid of any reaction that could fuel the narcissist's desire for drama and attention.

How to Use the Gray Rock Method

When a narcissist tries to provoke you, your first instinct may be to react defensively or emotionally. However, this only feeds their power. Instead, try the following:

 Recognize the Manipulation: Understand that the narcissist's criticism or provocation is solely intended to elicit a response.
 Remain Neutral and Unresponsive: Acknowledge their comments calmly without showing any emotion. Avoid engaging in arguments or debates.
 Redirect Attention Away: Once you've established neutrality, redirect the conversation back to the topic at hand or disengage from them altogether.

When to Use the Gray Rock Method

The Gray Rock Method is particularly effective when:

 Interactions with someone consistently leave you feeling drained or emotionally exhausted.
 The person constantly seeks attention, validation, or control in conversations.
 Your attempts to set boundaries or assert yourself are met with defensiveness, hostility, or disregard.

Benefits of the Gray Rock Method

By refusing to engage with a narcissist, you:

 Deprive them of the drama and attention they crave.
 Protect yourself from further emotional harm.
 Regain control over your own emotions and well-being.

Limitations of the Gray Rock Method

It's important to note that the Gray Rock Method is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It may not be effective in situations where there is a history of cyclically abusive behavior. If you find yourself trapped in a cycle of narcissistic abuse, it's crucial to seek professional help.

Conclusion

The Gray Rock Method can be a powerful tool for disengaging from narcissistic behavior and protecting your own well-being. By becoming emotionally unresponsive, you can starve narcissists of the attention they feed on and reclaim your happiness. Remember, you're not alone, and there are always ways to break free from the cycle of narcissistic abuse.

Meta's ""Pay or Privacy"" Dilemma: Consumer Groups Fight Back

Last year, Meta sparked controversy by introducing a ""pay or consent"" model for European Union (EU) users. Under this model, users had to pay a monthly fee to opt out of targeted advertising or agree to be tracked for profiling purposes.

This move has drawn the ire of consumer rights groups, who argue that it violates EU data protection rules. Eight consumer groups from across Europe have filed complaints with national data protection authorities, alleging that Meta's offer is unfair and coercive.

The ""Pay-or-Consent"" Model Under Scrutiny

The consumer groups argue that Meta's model does not meet the high standards of consent required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They contend that users are not fully informed about how their data is processed and that the fee imposed on those who do not consent is not necessary.

Specifically, the groups accuse Meta of violating the GDPR principles of:

 Purpose limitation: Processing data for purposes other than those specified
 Data minimization: Collecting more data than necessary
 Fair processing: Treating users fairly and transparently

The Stakes for Meta and EU Users

The complaints could have significant implications for Meta. Penalties for violating the GDPR can reach up to 4% of global annual turnover. More importantly, Meta could be forced to stop its tracking-based advertising business in the EU if the complaints are upheld.

For EU users, the outcome of these complaints could determine their ability to protect their privacy online. If Meta's model is found to be unlawful, it could force the company to change its business practices and give users more control over their data.

Other Challenges to Meta's Model

The consumer group complaints are not the only challenge Meta faces. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) also impose restrictions on the use of personal data for advertising purposes. These regulations require consent to be freely given and easily withdrawn.

The European Commission, which oversees enforcement of the DSA and DMA, could also take action against Meta if it finds that the ""pay or consent"" model violates these regulations. Penalties under these laws can be even higher than those under the GDPR.

Conclusion

The consumer group complaints against Meta's ""pay or consent"" model represent a significant challenge to the company's business practices. If upheld, these complaints could force Meta to reform its tracking-based advertising business and give EU users more control over their data. The outcome of these complaints will be closely watched by privacy advocates and regulators alike.

Elon Musk's Legal Battle Against Hate Speech Watchdogs

Elon Musk's ongoing legal battle with the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has reached a critical juncture. The lawsuit, filed by Musk's company X, alleges that CCDH has spread false and misleading claims about the social media platform.

CCDH's Role in Monitoring Online Extremism

CCDH is a non-profit organization dedicated to combating hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on social media. Its reports have been widely cited by news outlets, including TechCrunch. After Musk's acquisition of Twitter, CCDH published findings on the platform's rise in hate speech and the potential for unbanned accounts, like neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, to generate significant ad revenue.

Musk's Lawsuit and CCDH's Defense

X's lawsuit accuses CCDH of illegally scraping data and violating its terms of service through Brandwatch, a social media monitoring tool. However, CCDH maintains that X's lawsuit is frivolous and violates California's anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits intended to silence critics.

Musk's Personal Involvement and Accusations

Musk has been personally involved in the lawsuit, labeling CCDH an ""evil propaganda machine"" on Twitter. He has also filed similar lawsuits against other media watchdogs, such as Media Matters for America and the Anti-Defamation League.

CCDH's Legal Team and Potential Impact

CCDH's legal team includes renowned lawyer Roberta Kaplan, known for her victory against former President Donald Trump in a defamation suit. A loss for CCDH in court could have a chilling effect on researchers studying hate speech and misinformation on social media. This research has been crucial in shedding light on the negative societal impacts of social media platforms.

Conclusion

The outcome of this lawsuit has significant implications for the freedom of researchers and the transparency of social media platforms. CCDH's work is essential in holding these platforms accountable for the spread of harmful content. Musk's legal actions, on the other hand, raise concerns about the potential for wealthy individuals to silence critics and suppress research that exposes the dark side of social media.

Coinbase Outage: Zero Balances and Frustration

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and Coinbase users were met with a rude awakening on Wednesday when they logged into their accounts to find their balances had mysteriously vanished. Despite assurances from Coinbase that ""Your assets are safe,"" the outage left many users anxious and frustrated.

Bitcoin's Surge and Coinbase's Strain

The outage coincided with a surge in Bitcoin's value, which recently reached $60,000, close to its all-time high. This surge has fueled renewed interest in cryptocurrency trading platforms like Coinbase, leading to a surge in traffic and demand.

High Traffic, High Anxiety

Coinbase's infrastructure, unfortunately, was not prepared for this influx of users. The app experienced technical difficulties, including zero balance displays and errors in buying and selling. Coinbase initially responded with automated troubleshooting steps, which did little to alleviate users' concerns.

Coinbase's Response and Timeline

Coinbase eventually acknowledged the issue on its status page, assuring users that their assets were safe and that the team was investigating. The company provided updates throughout the day, indicating that the outage was caused by high traffic and that it was working to resolve the issue.

User Reactions

Coinbase users took to social media to express their frustration and share screenshots of their zero balances. Some users reported that their mothers had also experienced the same issue, indicating the widespread nature of the outage.

Lessons Learned

The Coinbase outage highlights the importance of robust infrastructure for cryptocurrency trading platforms. With the increasing popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it's essential for these platforms to be able to handle high traffic without compromising user experience or security.

Conclusion

While Coinbase has assured users that their assets are safe, the outage has raised concerns about the stability and reliability of cryptocurrency trading platforms. As the crypto market continues to grow, it's crucial for these platforms to invest in infrastructure and customer support that can handle the increasing demand.
