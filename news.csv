Introduction

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained significant attention in the field of organic electronics due to their unique advantages, such as light weight, good mechanical flexibility, and translucency. However, balancing efficiency and stability in OSCs has remained a challenge. A research team led by Prof. Ge Ziyi from the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) has recently made a significant breakthrough in this area. By designing and synthesizing two self-assembled molecules (SAMs) with large dipole moments, they have developed highly efficient and stable binary OSCs with a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 19.70%. This remarkable achievement is published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition.

The Challenge of Balancing Efficiency and Stability

OSCs have experienced rapid improvement in PCE, which has now surpassed 19%. Despite this progress, the stability of OSCs remains an issue, primarily due to the use of PEDOT:PSS as a widely employed hole transporting material. PEDOT:PSS imparts low stability to OSCs because of its hydrophilicity and strong acidity. To tackle this challenge, the NIMTE research team aimed to create a balance between efficiency and stability by designing new materials.

Designing Self-Assembled Molecules with Asymmetric Backbone

The research group led by Prof. Ge Ziyi designed and synthesized two asymmetric SAMs with asymmetric backbones, named BrCz and BrBACz. These SAMs served as hole-transporting layers (HTLs) in binary OSCs based on various systems, including PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9.

Enhanced Performance of BrCz-Controlled and BrBACz-Controlled OSCs

Younger users will find this new addition integrated into their ""For You"" and ""Following"" feeds, providing easy access to informative and entertaining STEM-related material. Older users interested in exploring the feed may do so manually via the app's ""Content Preferences"" settings.

According to TikTok, the US pilot program revealed promising results, leading to over 33% of users enabling the STEM feed and approximately a third of teenagers visiting it weekly. Since its implementation, there has also been a noticeable surge in STEM-focused content creation – up 24%. In total, nearly 15 million related videos were posted worldwide during the previous three years.

Partnerships for Quality Control & Safety Measures

To maintain quality control and user safety, TikTok collaborates with reputable organizations such as Common Sense Networks and Poynter. These partners scrutinize the STEM feed content to verify appropriateness and credibility before being displayed; only passing materials qualify for inclusion.

Counteracting Criticisms Through Education

This strategic shift toward educational resources addresses some criticism directed at TikTok concerning potentially hazardous content shown to children and teenagers. Rights advocacy groups claim the app utilizes manipulative techniques to encourage extended screen time among users. As part of the solution, the EU initiated an investigation earlier this year to explore if TikTok violated the Digital Services Act regarding child protection measures. Specifically, they focus on minimizing exposure to inappropriate content and reducing elements promoting addictive behaviors.

Conclusion

By introducing features like the STEM feed, TikTok demonstrates its ability to evolve beyond entertainment purposes alone. By offering high-quality educational content tailored specifically for young audiences, the app reinforces its value proposition and strengthens its position against critics who question its impact on youth development. With continued collaboration between technology companies and regulatory bodies, platforms like TikTok can strike a balance between engagement and responsibility, ensuring safer digital spaces for generations to come.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1248373545.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-04-01 23:01:26,"TikTok is expanding its Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focus in Europe, following its initial launch in the US last year.

This feature will allow users to create a private collection of Reels with a friend, making it easier to discover and enjoy videos together. According to TechCrunch, Blend will be based on Reels that users have shared with others, as well as Reels they've both shown interest in.

For Instagram neophytes, a Reel is simply a short video on the platform that's meant to be entertaining. Any user can record and post a 15-second video with an audio track and special effects. With a private account, users can share their Reels with just their followers or close friends. With a public account, users can share their Reels with anyone on Instagram to watch.

To access a Reel, users can simply tap the Reels icon in the iOS or Android mobile app or on the website. Swipe or scroll up and down to watch each video. With the icons on the right, users can like, comment on, share, or listen to the audio from any Reel.

Instagram uses a few different tricks to direct users to Reels they may like. The app suggests Reels liked by someone they follow, Reels they've already watched, and posts they've liked or saved. Resharing a Reel, watching it until the end, or checking out the Reel's page are other signs that users might watch similar Reels.

With a feature like Blend, users can potentially expand the reach and engagement of a Reel by letting two people discover and enjoy the same videos together. This could be another feature that helps Instagram keep up with fellow video sharing platform TikTok, as the two battle for users and advertising dollars.

Last November, Instagram rolled out several new Reels features, including the ability to share Reels with just close friends instead of all followers, and a new editing feature that allows users to scale, crop, rotate clips, and undo and redo edits.

OpenAI's Voice Cloning: Risks, Uses & Compared to ElevenLabs' Tool","

ChatGPT and Sora have established OpenAI as a leader in AI technology. On Friday, the company shared insights into Voice Engine, a voice cloning AI model that can create realistic, emotive voices from text input and a 15-second audio sample. The technology is capable of generating a highly convincing voice that closely resembles the reference clip.

The risks associated with a voice cloning model are significant, and OpenAI has not yet released Voice Engine to the public. However, the company has privately tested the model with a small group of partners to learn more about its potential use cases and safeguards.

Partners who have tested Voice Engine were required to agree to OpenAI's usage policies, which prohibit them from impersonating an individual or organization without the original speaker's consent. Other safeguards include disclosing that the voice heard is AI-generated, watermarks that trace back to Voice Engine, monitoring the model's usage, and prohibiting the creation of new voices.

OpenAI's partners have found creative ways to use Voice Engine to provide assistance and translate voices. Age of Learning used the technology to offer non-readers and children reading support by generating pre-recorded voice-over content and personalized responses. HeyGen built a tool on Voice Engine that translates a speaker's voice into multiple languages.

Although Voice Engine remains in preview, other voice cloning models are already available to the public. ElevenLabs, a startup that has made headlines for both positive and negative use cases of its AI-powered voice-generating platform, has an easy-to-use Voice Cloning tool that requires an ElevenLabs account, voice samples, and a text prompt.

OpenAI's delay in entering the voice cloning space is wise, as the technology industry needs to bring attention to the risks of AI-generated voices and encourage users to verify sources before they believe what they hear and see.

Google has announced that it plans to replace software 'cookies' that track where Chrome users go on the internet with a more effective way to target ads while protecting users' privacy. The tech giant has agreed to delete a massive trove of search data to settle a lawsuit that tracked millions of US users who believed they were browsing the internet privately. If approved by a judge, Google must ""delete and/or remediate billions of data records"" linked to people using the Chrome browser's incognito mode.

The settlement calls for no cash damages to be paid but leaves an option for Chrome users who feel they were wronged to sue Google separately to get money. The original lawsuit sought at least $5 billion in damages. The lawsuit was filed in a California court and claimed that Google's practices had infringed on users' privacy by intentionally deceiving them with the incognito option.

Google has started limiting third-party cookies for some users of its Chrome browser, a first step towards eventually abandoning the files that have raised privacy concerns. The tech giant announced in January 2020 that it would begin eliminating third-party cookies within two years, but the start has been delayed several times amid opposition from web media publishers. Cookies have recently been subject to greater regulation, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation introduced in 2016 as well as regulations in California.

The object of the lawsuit was the ""Incognito Mode"" in the Chrome browser that plaintiffs said gave users a false sense that what they were surfing online was not being tracked by the Silicon Valley tech firm. However, internal Google emails brought forward in the lawsuit demonstrated that users using incognito mode were being followed by the search and advertising behemoth for measuring web traffic and selling ads.

Google's settlement requires the company to block third-party tracking ""cookies"" by default in Incognito Mode for the next five years. Third-party cookies are small files that are used to target advertising by tracking web navigation and are placed by visited sites and not by the browser itself.

Google's move to replace software 'cookies' with a more effective way to target ads is a step towards protecting users' privacy. The tech giant's agreement to delete a massive trove of search data is a significant step towards settling the lawsuit and ensuring that users' data is protected. The settlement's requirement for Google to block third-party tracking ""cookies"" by default in Incognito Mode is a positive step towards protecting users' privacy.

In conclusion, Google's move to replace software 'cookies' with a more effective way to target ads is a positive step towards protecting users' privacy. The tech giant's agreement to delete a massive trove of search data is a significant step towards settling the lawsuit and ensuring that users' data is protected. The settlement's requirement for Google to block third-party tracking ""cookies"" by default in Incognito Mode is a positive step towards protecting users' privacy.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/autism-impact-fund/,Autism Impact Fund closes $60 million first fund and broadens its scope,Autism Impact Fund Raises $60M in First Fund and Broadens Scope,"

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects millions of people worldwide, and startups and investors are finally starting to venture into this space. The Autism Impact Fund (AIF) was a pioneer in this field when it emerged in 2021, following the diagnosis of the son of its co-founder and managing partner, Chris Male. The fund's goal was to become ""the investment and innovation arm of the autism community.""

Recently, AIF closed its first fund at $60 million, exceeding its target of $50 million. As a first-of-its-kind fund, this feat is no small accomplishment, especially in a challenging environment. AIF is a venture capital fund, not a charity, and Male is vocal about it. He is also intentional in driving returns while revolutionizing the status quo for autism and everything in the space through the venture capital model.

AIF's limited partners include Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Brian Jacobs from Emergence Capital Partners, and Bob Nelsen, a co-founder and managing director of ARCH Venture Partners, who also sit on its advisory board. However, institutional LPs such as investment firms Fairfield-Maxwell and Ferd also support AIF, which is a sign of change.

AIF has already started investing since its first close, and it will soon raise its second fund in the next six to nine months. The portfolio of AIF includes 12 startups, and it has already raised follow-on rounds from other investors, such as CVS Health Ventures, which led a $40 million Series D extension round of investment into healthcare startup Cortica in October.

AIF's decision to broaden its scope is due to the definition of autism being so vague and so broad that there is no biologically precise understanding of exactly what's happening. In order to help individuals and families, AIF has to broaden its aperture. The fund will now allow itself to invest in ""behavioral health data-driven platforms, innovative healthcare solutions, as well as value-based care frameworks,"" and AI is ""impossible to ignore.""

The societal cost of autism is in the trillions of dollars, and if the rise of incidence increases at the rate it is, it will be $15 trillion. Lack of employment and being unable to work is factored into that. However, society is sleepwalking into this incredible crisis, for which there is no current plan. AIF's portfolio includes a diverse range of companies, including Germany-based consulting firm Auticon, which describes itself as an ""autism-majority company,"" and British telehealth platform Healios.

In conclusion, the Autism Impact Fund (AIF) is a venture capital fund that aims to revolutionize the status quo for autism and everything in the space. With a portfolio of 12 startups and a second fund on the horizon, AIF is committed to driving returns while addressing the needs of the autism community. As the world becomes more aware of the challenges faced by individuals and families affected by autism, funds like AIF are essential in driving innovation and change.

I cried, and Hume's EVI told me it cared", Hume AI's Empathetic Voice Interface: Revolutionizing Artificial Emotional Intelligence ,"Title: Unleashing Empathy: A New Era of Artificial Emotional Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making significant strides over the years, demonstrating impressive feats of intellect. Recently, the spotlight has shifted towards exploring AI's potential in understanding and responding to human emotions – a realm known as artificial emotional intelligence. This development brings us to Hume AI's groundbreaking innovation – the Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI), self-proclaimed as ""the first AI with emotional intelligence.""

Hume AI recently secured $50 million in Series B funding and concurrently released the beta version of EVI. Combining advanced large language models (LLMs) and expression measures, Hume AI introduces the concept of an empathic large language model (eLLM). By analyzing vocal cues and dialogue, EVI aims to identify human emotions accurately, providing tailored responses addressing individual emotional requirements.

Let's delve deeper into this fascinating subject matter.

Understanding Empathetic Voice Interfaces

An Empathetic Voice Interface transcends mere speech recognition by interpreting nuanced verbal intonations indicative of underlying emotions. When faced with a user expressing despair, for instance, EVI responds sympathetically, offering comforting phrases along with pertinent counsel. Moreover, it comprehends conversational contexts, enabling seamless transitions between topics while respecting natural pauses and interruptions inherent to human communication.

A Closer Look at EVI's Capabilities

Curious about this novel creation, I visited the Hume AI website to test the demo. After granting permission to use my microphone, I engaged in several intriguing dialogues with EVI, showcasing its remarkable ability to perceive and react appropriately based on perceived emotions.

My initial exchange was casual, similar to interacting with a coworker via video conferencing. Upon greeting EVI (""Hi, Hume, how are you?""), it correctly identified my cheerful disposition marked by surprise, amusement, and curiosity. Subsequently, we discussed my daily activities, further solidifying its aptitude in maintaining engaging discussions.

Switching gears, I adopted a melancholic tone accompanied by simulated tears, uttering, ""How are you? I am having such a hard day."" In response, EVI exhibited compassionate discernment, identifying my expressed feelings as sadness, pain, and distress. Furthermore, it offered reassuring support and solace during this fabricated moment of vulnerability.

Impressively, despite being currently unavailable for public usage, EVI promises widespread availability soon. Prospective users interested in early adoption may sign up for notifications regarding its official release.

Practical Applications of Empathetic LLMs

This newfound integration of emotional awareness could revolutionize multiple sectors ripe for meaningful connections between humans and machines. Specifically, healthcare and customer service industries stand to benefit immensely from these advancements. Consider mental health platforms employing bots powered by eLLMs capable of recognizing subtle shifts in patients' moods, allowing timelier intervention strategies. Simultaneously, customer support channels incorporating such emotionally intuitive systems foster heightened satisfaction levels among consumers seeking relatable assistance experiences.

As illustrated above, artificial emotional intelligence holds immense promise for enhancing our future relationships with digital entities. With ongoing technological developments, we edge ever closer to realizing harmoniously integrated partnerships bridging both worlds.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/c83da6252711832f984ca73c831286e9edf63376/2024/04/01/f1eafba1-18f0-4e7b-8441-b5603397afb3/img-1653.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Meta Description: Discover Hume AI's Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI), a groundbreaking AI with emotional intelligence.

Introduction:

Canoo, an electric vehicle (EV) startup, released its 2023 earnings report, highlighting the company's financial progress and challenges. As the EV industry becomes increasingly competitive, Canoo is striving to scale up volume production of its commercial electric vehicles and distinguish itself from other struggling startups, like Arrival, which recently filed for bankruptcy. This article examines Canoo's 2023 earnings report, focusing on revenue, expenses, and governance.

Revenue and Losses:

In 2023, Canoo reported revenue of $886,000, a significant increase from zero dollars in 2022. The company attributes this growth to the delivery of 22 vehicles to various entities, including NASA and the state of Oklahoma. While this progress is promising, the revenue-to-losses gap remains substantial. Canoo's total net losses for 2023 stood at $302.6 million, with a loss from operations of $267 million, down from $506 million in 2022.

Expenses and the CEO's Private Jet:

One notable expense in Canoo's 2023 earnings report is the reimbursement for CEO Tony Aquila's private jet. Under a deal established in November 2020, Canoo reimburses Aquila Family Ventures, an entity owned by the CEO, for the use of an aircraft. In 2023, Canoo spent $1.7 million on this reimbursement, double the amount of revenue generated. This expense, along with other shared services support costs totaling $1.7 million in 2023, $1.1 million in 2022, and $500,000 in 2021, raises questions about the company's spending habits.

Governance and Transparency:
