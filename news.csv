Elon Musk's social networking platform, formerly known as Twitter, has announced that it will soon remove the option for paid users to hide their blue checkmarks. Initially introduced as a feature exclusively for premium users, hiding the blue checkmarks allowed individuals to keep their payments private, especially after the checks transformed into a purchasable item. However, X now plans to discontinue this capability without providing a definitive timeline.

Originally, blue checkmarks served as a badge of honor, distinguishing legitimate profiles from impersonations based on the account's influence or significance. Post-Musk takeover, the checks became a pay-to-play feature, diminishing their value as a status symbol. Despite this shift, premium membership offered additional perks, including editing tools, extended post lengths, and enhanced direct messaging capabilities—making the hidden checkmark a coveted option for those uncomfortable showcasing their payment to the platform.

With the impending removal of the hide function, dissatisfied users are voicing their concerns online. Many express disappointment in having their financial involvement highlighted against their preference. Aside from user backlash, X faces ongoing challenges related to trust and safety, grappling with issues ranging from impersonation to misinformation, harassment, and other forms of harmful content. By turning the blue checkmark into a revenue generator, Musk weakened its potential role in addressing these critical problems.

Further complicating matters, X's treatment of blue checkmarks has become inconsistent throughout its existence. Following the initial rollout of exclusive paid checkmarks, several users retained their marks despite not financially contributing to the platform. Subsequently, the company expanded blue check eligibility to include highly followed ""verified"" users—creating a murky hierarchy where various tiers of paid members exist alongside unpaid ones, all marked similarly.

In summary, X's decision to eliminate the hide function adds yet another layer of complexity regarding the meaning behind blue checkmarks. While premium users may lose their discretionary privileges, the broader community remains affected by lingering ambiguity surrounding the purpose and credibility associated with the once-esteemed symbols.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-blue-gold.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-12 04:25:40,"Unveiling Blue Checkmarks: X Removes Hide Option for Premium Users

The AI-human synergy facilitated by DISCount leads to enhanced accuracy in counting damaged buildings and bird flocks in large image collections. The versatile framework, compatible with various computer vision models, offers a promising solution for diverse applications.","Title: Blending AI and Human Analysis: A Revolutionary Approach to Counting in Large Image Collections

Introduction

In a groundbreaking development, researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst have unveiled an innovative AI framework called DISCount. This framework combines the prowess of artificial intelligence and the reliability of human analysis to provide rapid and accurate estimates of specific features within vast collections of images. The research, published in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, has been recognized with an award for the best paper on AI for social impact.

Two Challenges, One Solution

The team, comprising Subhransu Maji, Gustavo Pérez, and Dan Sheldon, initially tackled two distinct problems: detecting damaged buildings in crisis zones and estimating the size of bird flocks. The researchers recognized the potential of computer vision, a type of AI that scans large archives of images to identify and count specific elements, as the key to addressing these challenges.

The researchers aimed to build automated tools that could be utilized by non-AI experts while ensuring a high level of reliability. However, they faced a common hurdle—standard computer vision models could not provide the necessary accuracy.

A New Approach: Combining AI and Human Expertise

To overcome this issue, the team reimagined the traditional approach to solving counting problems. Instead of relying solely on humans or artificial intelligence, they sought to merge the two.

DISCount, a framework compatible with any existing AI computer vision model, was developed to address this challenge. The framework employs the AI to analyze extensive data sets—such as all images taken of a particular region over a decade—to pinpoint a smaller, more critical set of data for human researchers to examine. 

For instance, the AI might select all images from a few critical days that best illustrate the extent of building damage in a region. Human researchers can then manually count the damaged buildings within this reduced set of images. The algorithm uses the human-derived counts to extrapolate the number of buildings affected throughout the entire region, ultimately estimating the accuracy of the human-generated estimate.

DISCount's Impact

DISCount significantly outperforms random sampling for the tasks it considers. Additionally, the framework's compatibility with any computer-vision model allows researchers to choose the best AI approach for their needs.

It remains under 50 characters while maintaining the key facts and context.","Title: Taylor Swift's Triumphant Return to TikTok: A Strategic Move for Artists' Rights and Engagement

Introduction

In a bold move for artists' rights and fan engagement, Taylor Swift's music is finally back on TikTok after a 10-week absence—but there's a twist. Only her newer tracks and ""Taylor's Version"" remakes, which she now owns, have made their way onto the popular video-sharing app (Blistein, 2023). This development comes amid heated negotiations between Universal Music Group (UMG) and TikTok over licensing agreements, affecting various musicians under UMG's roster. Let's delve deeper into this intriguing saga and explore how both parties stand to gain from this strategic partnership.

A Power Struggle Between Labels and Platforms

Last year, UMG decided to pull its entire catalog from TikTok due to failed discussions regarding renewed terms. In response, UMG released a fiery statement claiming TikTok attempted to bully them into signing a subpar agreement by manipulatively favoring established acts over rising talents (Minsker, 2023). According to UMG, these actions aimed to pressure the company into agreeing to unfavorable conditions detrimental to emerging artists, songwriters, and their respective audiences. Although TikTok declined to issue a formal response, they likely understood the consequences of losing such influential labels from their platform.

Swift's Unique Position Amid Contractual Disputes

Understandably, UMG represents several heavyweight artists like Billie Eilish, BTS, Ariana Grande, and Olivia Rodrigo; however, Taylor Swift occupies a distinct place in this predicament. Following her past contractual disagreements, Swift embarked on re-recording her earlier albums to regain control of her master recordings. Fortunately, her ""Taylor's Version"" renditions grace TikTok once again, albeit without access to tunes from later releases like ""Reputation,"" which hasn't received the same treatment yet.

Timely Returns and Mutual Benefits

Coinciding with the impending launch of her latest opus, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" Swift's resurgence on TikTok seems far from accidental (Caulfield, 2023). Given her massive following, denying users the chance to create videos utilizing sounds from her upcoming magnum opus could hinder its overall visibility and success. On the other hand, TikTok gains immensely from hosting Swift's devoted fandom, who generate myriad audio trends bound to captivate millions worldwide. It's no secret that similar platforms, including Instagram Reels, eagerly anticipate capitalizing on these lucrative opportunities. Thus, welcoming Swift back guarantees substantial user interaction and heightened exposure for the Chinese-owned entity.

This revelation came following an ongoing cyberattack on Microsoft, highlighting the gravity and vulnerabilities of our digital landscape. This article will delve deeper into these alarming incidents while providing insights into the measures taken to mitigate potential risks.

Body

According to CISA, Russian hackers, under the moniker ""Midnight Blizzard"" or APT29, successfully compromised Microsoft corporate email accounts, leading to the theft of confidential correspondences between various agencies. Although no explicit list of affected federal entities has been released, the seriousness of the situation prompted CISA to issue Emergency Directive 21-02.

This directive mandated all civilian government agencies to safeguard their email accounts against escalating intrusions by Midnight Blizzard. Measures include immediate password resets and securing vulnerable systems – actions implemented after informing affected federal bodies a week prior. Despite increased scrutiny around Microsoft's security practices, due to widespread dependency among governmental institutions for managing email accounts, there remains radio silence regarding current remediation progress.

It is worth noting that Microsoft publicly acknowledged the Russian hacking group's entry into certain corporate email systems back in January. Amongst the victims were members of the senior leadership team along with numerous employees working across different departments like cybersecurity, legal, etc., as per Microsoft's statements. The primary objective behind these attacks appeared to gather intelligence related to the hackers themselves rather than seeking financial benefits. As time passed, further targets emerged beyond Microsoft, affecting external organizations, one of them being none other than US government agencies.

By March, Microsoft continued addressing the 'ongoing attack', revealing the hackers aimed to utilize previously acquired secrets to penetrate additional internal systems stealthily. Their goal? Exfiltrating even more sensitive data, potentially including source codes. Unfortunately, updates concerning progress towards eliminating this threat remain pending from Microsoft.

Amongst other significant developments linked to similar instances, the US Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) recently completed investigations surrounding a previous 2023 Chinese government-backed hack targeting American government emails. According to the report, a series of missteps at Microsoft paved the way for the perpetrators, enabling them to extract critical email keys essential for extensive access to both commercial and governmental mailboxes.

Furthermore, adding insult to injury, nearly 20,000 people received notification from the US Department of Defense early February about their personal info exposure. Apparently, lack of authentication settings on a Microsoft-hosted cloud email server resulted in accidental online availability of sensitive data over several weeks during 2023.

Over the past couple of years, the market for venture secondaries has surged significantly. While some firms have capitalized on this uptick by increasing their investments in top-performing portfolio companies, Australia's Airtree Ventures has taken a slightly different approach. Founded in 2014, the Sydney-based venture firm utilizes company-led secondary sales to strategically reduce its equity stakes and secure liquidity from successful ventures. Among these include homegrown unicorns such as Canva (valued at $40 billion), Immutable ($2.4 billion), and Linktree ($1.3 billion).

Co-founder and Partner Craig Blair explains that Airtree's ultimate objective remains consistent with other venture firms—to maximize investor returns. However, Airtree distinguishes itself by generating returns consistently across the entire lifetime of each investment, instead of only upon a company's exit. ""From day one,"" Blair states, ""we aim to devote as much effort and consideration towards the exit process as we do for the initial funding process."" By analyzing both individual businesses and overall fund lifespans, Airtree identifies optimal times to divest from certain enterprises.

Typically investing during the pre-seed and seed stages, Airtree must adapt to extended durations before companies begin providing returns due to later exits. In response, Airtree explored new methods of obtaining liquidity for early-stage stakes in 2021. One prominent example involves Canva, where Airtree initially participated in a $6 million Series A round in 2015. Subsequently, Airtree reduced its holding in the thriving startup when its valuation reached $39 billion in 2021. This strategic move yielded a 1.4x return on Fund I through a recent Canva sale while preserving the bulk of Airtree's original shareholding.

When determining whether to decrease its stake in a particular enterprise, Airtree evaluates various factors without adhering to strict rules. These considerations encompass the fund's standing, the significance of the given company to that fund, and potential ramifications associated with immediate vs. long-term gains. Each instance entails maintaining a substantial portion of the stake held by Airtree. As Blair elaborates, the firm seeks significant windfalls yet refrains from concentrating all resources on the final outcome.

In light of diminishing valuations observed among late-stage startups recently, this strategy proves particularly astute. Although several organizations strive toward reaching previous levels, numerous ones face considerable challenges and might ultimately sell below their latest primary round figures. Nonetheless, Airtree's method carries inherent risks. Despite sacrificing profits at the moment of exit under this framework, Blair admits that the eventual payoff remains uncertain and potentially suboptimal.

Despite recognizing the benefits of establishing a continuation fund—the preferred tool currently employed within the venture sector for enhancing liquidity—Airtree remains committed to its existing tactic of participating in company-initiated secondary tender transactions. According to Blair, proactive decision making regarding liquidity takes precedence over merely waiting passively for events to unfold naturally. He emphasizes, ""Our duty as investors involves delivering funds to our Limited Partners appropriately. Selling prematurely poses drawbacks, certainly. Ultimately, striking a balance between calculated choices and patience yields success.""","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/canva-logo.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-11 17:11:46,"Maximize Investment Returns: Discover how Airtree Ventures uses company-led secondary sales for liquidity & growth in Canva, Immutable, and Linktree!

To achieve this goal, they analyze individual businesses and overall fund lifespans to identify optimal times to divest from certain enterprises. Co-founder and Partner Craig Blair highlights the importance of devoting equal attention to the exit process as the initial funding process.

Company-led secondary sales enable Airtree Ventures to maintain a substantial portion of their stake even after reducing it, allowing them to benefit from future growth while securing partial liquidity. For instance, Airtree sold part of its holdings in Canva, which yielded a 1.4x return on Fund I despite retaining most of its original shares.

While there are risks involved in prioritizing proactive decisions over passive waiting, Airtree believes that balancing calculated choices and patience will lead to success.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised alarms over big tech firms like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (GAMMA) dominating the foundational AI models market. With growing interconnections among developers leading to increased concentration, there's a risk of reduced choice, lower quality, and higher prices for both businesses and consumers. Recent events, such as the close ties between OpenAI and Microsoft, have led the CMA to examine these relationships carefully, even though they aim to let the market evolve before implementing regulations.","Title: The CMA's Growing Concerns Over Big Tech's Dominance in the AI Market

Introduction

The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has expressed growing concerns over big technology firms' entrenching grip on the advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) market. The authority's CEO, Sarah Cardell, has voiced ""real concerns"" about the sector's development, particularly in the area of foundational AI models. This article discusses the CMA's Update Paper on foundational AI models, the risks associated with the increasing dominance of big tech in the AI market, and the CMA's potential interventions.

The CMA's Warning on Foundational AI Models

In its Update Paper published on Thursday, the CMA cautioned about the increasing interconnection and concentration between developers in the cutting-edge tech sector responsible for the boom in generative AI tools. The regulator emphasized the recurring presence of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (GAMMA) across the AI value chain, including compute, data, model development, partnerships, release, and distribution platforms.

While the CMA recognizes that partnership arrangements can play a pro-competitive role in the technology ecosystem, it also warned that powerful partnerships and integrated firms could pose risks to competition that run counter to open markets.

The CMA's Concerns

The CMA is concerned that the foundational model sector is developing in ways that risk negative market outcomes. In particular, the growing presence across the foundational model value chain of a small number of incumbent technology firms could profoundly shape foundational model-related markets to the detriment of fair, open, and effective competition. This could ultimately harm businesses and consumers by reducing choice and quality and raising prices.

The CMA's Initial Review and Principles

The CMA undertook an initial review of the top end of the AI market last May and published a set of principles for responsible generative AI development. However, the regulator is not in a rush to regulate advanced AI, wanting to give the market a chance to develop.

However, recent developments, such as the cozy relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft, have prompted the CMA to scrutinize these relationships more closely. Additionally, research by the U.K.'s internet regulator","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778706496.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-11 17:21:16,"Meta Description: ""CMA raises concerns over big tech's dominance in AI market, proposes measures to foster competition & protect consumer rights.

Such control may lead to significant barriers to entry, limiting innovation and consumer welfare in the long term.

Potential Interventions from the CMA

The CMA proposes several measures to mitigate the threats posed by dominant players in the AI industry. These include:

 Encouraging greater transparency around partnerships and acquisitions involving AI technologies;
 Improving data portability to allow users to switch easily between services without losing their information;
 Enhancing user control over personal data usage by requiring explicit consent before sharing sensitive data with third parties;
 Investigating specific transactions where there might be substantial lessening of competition; and
 Developing guidance on how existing competition law rules apply to AI-enabled products and services.

Conclusion

As the world continues to embrace advancements in artificial intelligence, regulatory bodies like the UK's CMA need to strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring healthy competition. By addressing the rising influence of big tech in the AI landscape, regulators aim to protect both business interests and consumer rights while promoting sustainable growth in this critical field.

Here's what happened"," AT&T's Data Breach: Impact, Response, & Lessons Learned ","Title: Navigating the Aftermath of Data Breaches: A Case Study on AT&T's Recent Leak

Introduction

In today's digital age, data breaches have become increasingly common, affecting millions of users worldwide. One recent example comes from telecommunications giant AT&T, which experienced a significant data leak involving 70 million customers. This article will delve into the incident, analyzing AT&T's response and highlighting lessons learned for both companies and consumers alike.

AT&T's Data Leak and Response

On March 30, AT&T announced that a data breach had occurred, compromising some customer information. In response, the company initiated a series of communications with its customers, starting on April 11. Initially, AT&T intended to send all notifications simultaneously; however, recognizing potential challenges, they later decided to stage these communications over several days instead. According to AT&T Director of Corporate Communications Dan Feldstein, this approach aimed to allow their team and partner Experian to manage the situation more efficiently.

To mitigate risks associated with the breach, AT&T has taken steps to protect affected customers, including resetting account passcodes and providing a complimentary one-year subscription to Experian's IdentityWorks service—a comprehensive solution designed to monitor credit and detect instances of identity theft.

Experiencing High Traffic Surge and Website Issues

As expected, the influx of users attempting to access Experian's services resulted in substantial traffic, causing the website to perform sluggishly and return HTTP 500 errors during initial attempts. Additionally, some users reported difficulties logging in using SMS credentials through Experian's mobile app. Despite these hurdles, subscriptions ultimately proved legitimate, albeit following extended wait times. Users faced further complications while adding account information for monitoring purposes, encountering numerous HTTP timeouts throughout the process.

A Massive Increase in User Reports and System Stabilization

According to downdetector.com, Experian witnessed a considerable surge in user reports beginning around 5 p.m. ET on April 11. Although Experian claimed system stability by 4:54 p.m., complaints persisted until approximately 6 p.m. ET. As of publishing this article, there has been no official update addressing whether the issue has since been fully resolved.

Conclusion

Data breaches pose severe threats to organizations and their customers. Companies must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive information continually. Furthermore, prompt and effective communication strategies play a crucial role when incidents occur, ensuring transparency and minimizing panic among affected parties.

Consumers should remain vigilant about protecting their personal data. Regularly reviewing account activity, utilizing strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication where possible, and staying informed about ongoing security incidents can significantly reduce vulnerabilities.
