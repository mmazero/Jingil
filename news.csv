https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-promises-to-better-label-ai-generated-videos-images-and-audio/,"Meta promises to better label AI-generated videos, images, and audio", Meta to Label AI-Generated Content: New Approach from May 2024 ,"Title: Meta's New Approach to AI-Generated Content: Labeling Instead of Removal

Introduction

In an effort to maintain transparency and empower users, Meta recently announced its plans to label AI-generated content across its platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Threads. This decision comes after Meta's Oversight Board, public opinion surveys, and consultations with experts recommended a more comprehensive approach to handling AI-manipulated media. The new policy, which is set to take effect in May 2024, will focus on providing context and information to users rather than automatically removing such content.

The Evolution of Meta's AI Moderation Policy

Originally introduced in 2020, Meta's AI moderation policy focused on videos that were created or altered by AI to make it appear as though a person said something they didn't. However, recent advancements in generative AI called for a broader policy that covers any type of manipulation, such as making it appear as though someone did something they didn't.

The Meta Oversight Board's Recommendations

Meta's Oversight Board, which was established in 2020 to review the company's content moderation policies, found that the existing AI moderation approach was too narrow. The board recommended a less restrictive approach in which Meta would label the media as AI-generated but still allow users to view it. This change aims to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the need to combat misinformation.

Labels for AI-Generated Content

Starting in May 2024, Meta will add labels to images, videos, and audio clips generated by AI. These labels will be based on technical standards created by the company and industry partners, using certain industry-shared signals. The ""Made with AI"" labels will help users identify AI-generated content and better assess its credibility. In cases where AI-generated content poses a particularly high risk of deceiving the public on important matters, Meta may add more prominent labels to provide additional context.

Collaboration and Continuous Review

Meta recognizes the importance of working with industry partners, governments, and civil society to address the challenges posed by AI-manipulated media. The company aims to continue its collaboration through forums like the Partnership on AI and maintain a dialogue with relevant stakeholders.

Introduction

The world of mental health treatment is evolving, with technology playing an increasingly significant role in bridging gaps in access to care. The recent FDA approval of Rejoyn, a smartphone app designed to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), marks a significant milestone in this evolution. This article explores the potential of prescription digital therapeutics and their implications for the future of mental health treatment.

The Emergence of Prescription Digital Therapeutics

Traditional therapy and wellness apps have been instrumental in providing mental health support, but they lack the ability to diagnose and treat mental health disorders due to minimal regulation and the absence of clinical trials. Prescription digital therapeutics, however, are poised to change the landscape by offering evidence-based, clinically-validated treatments for various conditions, including MDD.

Rejoyn: The First FDA-Approved Digital Therapeutic for Depression

Developed by Click Therapeutics and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Rejoyn is the first digital therapeutic for depression that the FDA has cleared. Designed to supplement supervised care for adults with MDD who take antidepressant medication, Rejoyn leverages the brain's neuroplasticity through a six-week program called Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT). EFMT comprises brain-training exercises developed by neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists that target neural areas affected by depression.

EFMT's goal is to strengthen connections between brain regions responsible for processing and regulating emotions, ultimately improving emotional recognition and regulation. The FDA approved Rejoyn based on a 13-week study involving 386 participants, which demonstrated improvement in depression symptoms compared to a sham app.

Implications for Mental Health Treatment

Rejoyn's approval is timely, as depression rates have been rising among US adults. A May 2023 Gallup survey found that nearly 18% of respondents aged 18 and over reported being depressed or receiving treatment for depression. Digital therapies like Rejoyn could help broaden treatment options for mental health concerns, though their long-term effectiveness and insurance coverage remain to be seen.

Introduction

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Nagoya University's Graduate School of Informatics have successfully developed a diverse range of personality traits in dialogue AI using a large-scale language model (LLM). The team, led by Professor Takaya Arita and Associate Professor Reiji Suzuki, aimed to explore how LLMs could be used to evolve prompts that encourage various personality traits during social interactions. The findings of their research, published in Scientific Reports, provide valuable insights into the evolution of AI agents and their capacity to mimic human behavior.

The Power of Large-Scale Language Models

Large-scale language models (LLMs) form the backbone of advanced AI technologies such as ChatGPT, enabling computers to interact with people in a manner that resembles person-to-person communication. In this study, the researchers utilized LLMs to evolve personality traits in AI agents, allowing them to adapt their strategies through evolutionary processes.

The Prisoner's Dilemma and AI Personality Evolution

To explore the evolution of AI personalities, the researchers employed the prisoner's dilemma from game theory. In this game, each player chooses whether to cooperate with or defect from their partner. The outcome of the game depends on the choices of both AI systems:

1. If both cooperate, they each receive four virtual dollars.
2. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets five dollars, while the cooperator gets nothing.
3. If both defect, they receive one dollar each.

The AI agents were programmed with personality traits encoded in their genes, which were represented by natural language descriptions of various behaviors. These descriptions were then translated into behavioral strategies, allowing the AI agents to switch between selfish and cooperative behaviors, thus mirroring human behavior.

Evolutionary Framework and Personality Traits

The researchers used an evolutionary framework in which AI agents' abilities were shaped by natural selection and mutation over generations. This framework resulted in a wide range of personality traits, including both cooperative and selfish behaviors. Some agents displayed selfish characteristics, prioritizing their own interests above those of the community or group, while others demonstrated advanced strategies that balanced personal gain and mutual benefit.

Introduction

In our increasingly connected world, smart devices equipped with cameras have become commonplace in our homes and workplaces. These devices, part of the ""internet-of-things,"" use vision to perceive their surroundings, capturing images and videos of our lives. To address privacy concerns, researchers from the University of Sydney and Queensland University of Technology have developed a novel approach to designing cameras that process and scramble visual information before digitization, ensuring anonymity.

The Problem: Invasive Smart Devices

Smart devices, such as robotic vacuum cleaners, smart fridges, and baby monitors, capture vast amounts of visual data. This data can be compromised if the devices are hacked or lost, posing privacy risks. To tackle this issue, researchers have developed a privacy-preserving camera system that maintains functionality while protecting user privacy.

The Solution: Privacy-Preserving Cameras

The privacy-preserving camera system, created by researchers from the Australian Centre for Robotics at the University of Sydney and the Centre for Robotics (QCR) at Queensland University of Technology, processes and scambles visual information before digitization. The distorted images can still be used by robots to complete tasks but do not provide a comprehensive visual representation that compromises privacy.

Segmenting Processing in the Camera

The researchers have segmented the processing that typically occurs within a computer, placing it in the optics and analog electronics of the camera. This prevents attackers from accessing the images, as they exist beyond the reach of potential threats. This approach is more secure than previous methods that obfuscated images within the camera's computer, as those images remained vulnerable to attack.

Preserving Privacy in a Connected World

As more devices come equipped with cameras and new technologies emerge, privacy concerns will grow. The research team aims to build physical camera prototypes to demonstrate the approach in practice, hoping to see their design adopted by industry and used in various applications, such as warehouses, hospitals, factories, schools, and airports.

The recent earthquake in the New York/New Jersey area provided an excellent opportunity for Instagram's Threads to shine, but it missed the mark. While users were actively discussing the earthquake on the platform, the term did not trend until much later in the day. This raises questions about the effectiveness of Threads' algorithms and its potential as a competitor to Twitter.

Unlike Twitter, Threads does not use hashtags, which can make it challenging for users to tag trending terms. Instead, users have started using the tagging convention of ""[term] Threads,"" which can lead to confusion and prevent terms from gaining the necessary velocity to break into the top trends. This design choice may have contributed to the earthquake's delayed appearance in Threads' trends section.

When asked about the earthquake's absence from the top trends, Instagram stated that trends are based on national conversations, and the earthquake was a regional event. However, this explanation raises concerns about Threads' ability to keep up with real-time trends, which is crucial for a platform that aims to compete with Twitter.

Additionally, Meta's plan to distance itself from political discussions may also hinder Threads' growth. Twitter has long been the go-to platform for breaking news, active topical discussions, and a hub for journalists. Meta's decision to avoid political content could limit Threads' potential to become a significant player in this space.

Despite having 130 million monthly active users, Threads still faces challenges in delivering a true Twitter-like experience. Users have reported randomness in their For You feeds, which can detract from the platform's overall user experience.

Twitter's founders recognized the power of their platform in delivering real-time information, and this is why Twitter became the home to breaking news and active topical discussions. Threads still has a long way to go to replicate this success, but with continued development and refinement, it has the potential to become a significant player in the social media landscape.

In conclusion, while Instagram's Threads has made progress in establishing itself as a social media platform, it still faces challenges in competing with Twitter. By addressing issues with its algorithms and refining its user experience, Threads can continue to grow and establish itself as a viable alternative to Twitter.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IG-Threads-GettyImages-1513200869.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 19:55:51,"""Discover real-time trends with Instagram's Threads.

Introduction

Robotic systems have played an essential role in various industries, such as warehouses, airports, malls, and offices, where they take care of basic manual tasks and answer simple queries. However, the future holds a more significant potential for these robots, especially for air-ground robots, which can navigate both on the ground and in the air. These robots can be deployed in outdoor environments, where they can help search for survivors after natural disasters, deliver packages to remote locations, monitor natural environments, and accomplish complex missions in challenging outdoor settings.

Despite their potential, air-ground robots face issues when navigating occlusion-prone environments where obstacles can easily obstruct their sensors, leading to a higher risk of collisions. To tackle this issue, researchers from the University of Hong Kong introduced AGRNav, a novel framework to enhance the autonomous navigation of air-ground robots in such environments.

AGRNav: A Novel Framework

Air-ground robots boast exceptional mobility and extended endurance, making them suitable for navigating complex environments like forests and large buildings. However, these environments often have occluded and unknown regions, making it challenging to navigate using existing mapping-based and learning-based navigation methods.

To address this issue, the research team developed a computational approach, AGRNav, which consists of two main components:

1. Lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet)
2. Hierarchical path planner

The SCONet component predicts the distribution of obstacles and their semantic features in an environment using a deep learning approach, performing minimal calculations. This network effectively captures contextual information and occlusion area features by employing self-attention mechanisms.

The hierarchical path planner, on the other hand, utilizes the predictions made by SCONet to plan optimal and energy-efficient aerial and ground paths for a robot to reach a desired location.

Performance and Results

The researchers evaluated AGRNav in simulations and real-world environments using a customized air-ground robot. The results demonstrated that AGRNav outperformed all baseline and state-of-the-art robot navigation frameworks, efficiently identifying optimal and energy-saving paths for the robot",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-framework-to-improve.jpg,2024-04-05 06:50:02,"Meta Description:

In a recent turn of events, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, announced the reveal of a revolutionary product - a robotaxi - scheduled for August 8. This announcement comes after a Reuters report indicating that Tesla was shifting its focus from its proposed $25,000 low-cost EV to a robotaxi, both of which have been long-rumored in industry circles.

Tesla's sales and profits have been underperforming, prompting the company and its CEO to seek a new product to stimulate sales or, at the very least, the stock price. The Reuters report, based on three anonymous sources and internal documents, claimed that Tesla was abandoning its low-cost EV plans to concentrate its resources on a robotaxi. This robotaxi is slated to be built on the same compact EV platform initially intended for the low-cost vehicle.

Musk contested Reuters' report on the social media platform X, which he owns, by accusing the news outlet of lying, but without providing evidence or addressing any specific details. Later that day, Musk announced that a ""Tesla Robotaxi"" would be unveiled on August 8.

Musk has long been fascinated with the concept of self-driving vehicles. In 2016, he proclaimed that Tesla would have a fully autonomous car driving cross-country by the end of 2017. However, that goal was not met. In 2019, he announced the launch of Tesla's first robotaxis and envisioned an autonomous ride-sharing network in 2020, a target he also failed to achieve. More recently, he promised a dedicated robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals by 2024.

Tesla vehicles currently come equipped with a driver-assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $12,000, owners can purchase ""full self-driving"" (FSD) - a feature that CEO Elon Musk has long promised will one day provide full autonomous driving capabilities.

Despite these automated features, Tesla vehicles still require a human driver to monitor the driving environment and be prepared to take control at any time.

The robotaxi market has been heating up, with multiple competitors vying for a piece of the pie. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., has been aggressively testing its self-driving taxi service in several cities. Other players, such as Cruise, Nuro, and Zoox (acquired by Amazon), are also making significant strides in the autonomous vehicle space.

With the August 8 announcement, Tesla is poised to enter this competitive market. Musk's announcement, however, didn't include any details about the robotaxi's capabilities, pricing, or availability. Nonetheless, the announcement has already generated excitement and anticipation among Tesla enthusiasts and industry observers.

As Tesla prepares to unveil its robotaxi, questions about its autonomous technology and safety remain. The company has faced criticism for its aggressive marketing of its ""full self-driving"" feature, which has yet to deliver on its promise of true autonomous driving. Moreover, Tesla's Autopilot system has been involved in numerous crashes, raising concerns about its safety.

In response to these concerns, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has called on Tesla to limit the use of its Autopilot system to areas where it can safely operate. The NTSB has also urged Tesla to improve its system's driver monitoring capabilities to ensure that drivers remain attentive while using Autopilot.

In our digital age, many of us rely on Google Books and Google Scholar to find books on specific topics or delve into academic research. However, recent developments have revealed that these platforms now index low-quality, AI-generated books disguised as human-authored works. Let's explore this issue and its implications.

An alert was first raised by 404 Media, which discovered AI-generated books in Google Books using a clever trick. By asking ChatGPT about current events, you may notice the phrase ""As of my last knowledge update."" This is OpenAI's way of informing users about the chatbot's limitations in accessing up-to-date information. When searching Google Books for this specific phrase, numerous titles appear, seemingly written by human authors but actually generated by AI.

One such book discussing the Boston Marathon bombing used the phrase ""As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the case continued to be subject to legal proceedings, and the ultimate outcome was still uncertain"" when discussing the attackers. This book's author has published 50 other works, covering topics like the Cold War, 9/11, America's founding fathers, ancient Rome, famous boxers, and famous Native Americans. Remarkably, all of these titles were published in 2023, ranging between 50 and 100 pages, with content that merely skims the surface of the subjects, similar to a Wikipedia entry or AI-generated facts. These books are even available for purchase on Amazon and other retailers.

A similar search in Google Scholar, a platform meant for human research, yielded 19 pages of results, including papers on at-risk youth, diabetes, autism, COVID-19, and airline pilot fatigue. This suggests that AI-generated content is not confined to Google Books but has infiltrated Google Scholar as well.

While AI-generated content has long been a concern on the web, its appearance alongside human-written work in reliable resources like Google Books and Google Scholar is alarming. It raises questions about the credibility and trustworthiness of these platforms. Google, in response to 404 Media, stated that it would ""continue to evaluate our approach as the world of book",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b093ab7779d555827f18ed230b1346fb4d31bf24/2024/04/05/2331d04b-5a07-4605-95ad-f71bf16ea752/bookwallgettyimages-184268876.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-05 00:00:00,"Meta Description:

Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) account for only 5% of vehicles on the road in the United States, yet they contribute to 21% of transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As the world grapples with the effects of climate change and the need to improve air quality, reducing MHDV emissions is of paramount importance. Zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), such as battery electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), offer a promising solution. Though the adoption of ZEVs in the MHDV sector faces various challenges, economic factors significantly influence consumer decisions regarding commercial vehicle applications.

Cost-parity of zero-emission trucks

The study by NREL reveals that the total cost of driving (TCD) for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (ZEVs) will reach cost-parity with diesel-powered counterparts by the mid-2030s. This cost-parity is attributed to several factors, including advancements in battery technology and the declining costs of hydrogen fuel cells.

The cost-parity of ZEVs with diesel trucks is a significant milestone in the transition to a more sustainable transportation sector, as it addresses the economic concerns of fleet operators. With the increasing emphasis on corporate social responsibility and stricter emissions regulations, achieving cost-parity is a crucial step towards wider ZEV adoption in the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle market.

End of generated content: cost-parity

The report further highlights that the cost-parity of ZEVs and diesel trucks will vary depending on the vehicle segment and application. For instance, transit buses and refuse trucks are projected to reach cost-parity sooner than other segments, driven by the high energy efficiency and lower fuel costs associated with ZEVs.

Moreover, regional differences in electricity and hydrogen costs, as well as government incentives, will impact the cost-parity timeline for ZEVs across the United States. As such, it is essential to tailor policy measures and infrastructure development plans to support the transition to zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in various regions.

To further accelerate the achievement of cost-parity, the study recommends continuous investment in research and development of zero-emission technologies, as well as the implementation of supportive policies such as tax credits, grants, and low-carbon fuel standards. By focusing on these aspects, the transportation industry can work towards a more sustainable future, where zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles become the norm.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

A few days ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that Snapchat's ""solar system"" feature was causing anxiety among teenagers. This feature, designed for paid subscribers, ranks friends based on their communication frequency, displaying their position in the user's ""solar system."" Recently, Snapchat has responded to user feedback by adjusting the feature's functionality.

The ""solar system"" ranks friends with Mercury being those you communicate with most and Uranus for less frequent contacts. Although online chatting may not directly reflect real-world relationships, this feature can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Snapchat acknowledged the issue and, instead of removing the feature, has decided to turn it off by default for Snapchat+ subscribers, who can still enable it if they wish.

While Snapchat argues that the feature is not widely used (less than 0.25% of the community uses it), this percentage might be misleading since it's exclusive to paid subscribers. The company believes that turning it off by default will provide a balance between offering a desired feature and avoiding upsetting those who don't want to use it. However, it is likely that tech-savvy teens will find their way to re-enable the feature.

Snapchat's solar system feature is not its first friend-ranking system. The app also offers a private ""Best Friends"" feature, which highlights frequent contacts with emojis. Another controversial feature, ""Streaks,"" encourages repeated app usage by displaying consecutive days of interaction between users. After much criticism and concerns over its addictive nature and psychological impacts, Snapchat introduced a way to pause streaks and restore lost ones.

Snapchat has promised to address potential downsides of online communication, but some of its features have left it open to lawsuits and Congressional inquiry. Though the ""solar system"" feature has been adjusted, it raises questions about the role of social media platforms in shaping users' self-perception and relationships. By offering features that rank and compare friends, these platforms risk reinforcing social hierarchies and potentially causing harm to young users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Evan-Spiegel-SnapDSC04002.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 23:38:52,"""Discover how Snapchat adjusted its 'social ranks' feature amid user concerns!

But who decides when AGI is attained?," Tech Giants Race to Build AGI: Defining, Measuring, and Regulating Artificial General Intelligence ","Title: The Pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence: A New Frontier in AI Research

Introduction

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), also known as ""strong AI,"" is a concept that has been captivating the scientific community for decades. It refers to machines that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like humans do. The pursuit of AGI has become a race among tech giants, startups, and governments, driven by the potential to revolutionize industries and transform society. However, the path to AGI is fraught with challenges and controversies, as experts grapple with its definition, measurement, and potential consequences.

Understanding AGI

AGI is often confused with Generative AI, which involves AI systems that generate new content, such as text, images, and sounds. However, AGI is a more ambitious and nebulous idea, referring to machines that can perform virtually any cognitive task that a human can. It is not a technical term but a concept that represents the original vision of artificial intelligence before it branched into specialized and commercially viable subfields.

AGI proponents aim to build a thinking machine that can reason, plan, and learn from experiences, surpassing human-level intelligence. However, the lack of a clear definition and consensus on what constitutes AGI makes it challenging to determine when it has been achieved. Some experts argue that current AI systems, such as GPT-4 or Google's Gemini, have already reached AGI, while others contend that they still fall short of the mark.

Measuring AGI

Measuring AGI is a complex task that requires a community effort and agreement on classifications. One approach is to segment AGI into levels, similar to how carmakers benchmark the path between cruise control and fully self-driving vehicles. This would involve defining specific milestones and criteria that AI systems must meet to advance from one level to the next.

For instance, an AGI system at level 1 might be able to perform basic cognitive tasks, such as recognizing objects or answering questions, while a level 5 AGI system would possess human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks. However, even defining level 1 AGI is a challenge, as it requires a clear understanding of what constitutes a basic cognitive task.

Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workforce has been a hot topic of debate in recent years. As AI continues to evolve, it's essential to examine its potential impact on jobs and how it can be harnessed to empower workers and employers alike. In this article, we will explore the complexities of AI's influence on employment, discuss the concerns of job displacement, and consider the opportunities it presents for boosting productivity and leveling the playing field for individuals and small businesses.

The Double-Edged Sword of AI

Artificial intelligence is a powerful force that offers both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, AI can serve as a cost-saving measure for employers by replacing human workers with automated systems, potentially leading to job displacement. This is a valid concern, especially for industries that rely heavily on manual labor or creative work.

On the other hand, AI can be a game-changer for budget-constrained individuals and small businesses. By augmenting their capabilities, AI can help them increase their work output, compete with larger players, and regain personal time. Moreover, AI can democratize creativity and knowledge by enabling those with linguistic or artistic challenges to produce output they might not have been able to offer before.

The Evolution of Work Roles and Career Paths

Technological advancement has always been disruptive, and AI is no exception. While it can introduce periods of growth and promise for those driving innovation, it can also result in painful transitions for workers in careers left behind. However, history shows that as some jobs become obsolete, new opportunities emerge to serve different needs.

For instance, the advent of electronic switching and dial phones led to the disappearance of many human telephone operators' jobs. Still, it also paved the way for new roles and required skills, such as those needed to maintain and repair the new technology. Similarly, the shift from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles, and from film cameras to digital cameras, brought about the decline of certain professions but also introduced new ones.

Preparing for the AI-Driven Future

To minimize the negative impact of AI on jobs, it's crucial to invest in education and re-skilling programs that equip workers with the necessary skills to thrive in an AI-driven world",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/72571c1445b33317c01ae9d140c4b951162623d4/2024/04/05/a6d04e2c-581e-4005-b091-a8968e05a6d1/workerssunrisegettyimages-674977783.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-05 00:00:00,"Meta Description:
