https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scientists-ai-power-hungry.html,Computer scientists show the way: AI models need not be so power hungry, Energy-Efficient AI: Balancing Power Consumption and Precision in Model Development ,"Title: Striking a Balance: Energy-Efficient AI Development for a Sustainable Future

The energy consumption of AI models has become a topic of increasing concern as the world becomes increasingly reliant on AI technology. A single prompt to a model like ChatGPT, for instance, is estimated to consume as much energy as forty mobile phone charges. According to a study, AI servers could consume as much energy as Argentina or Sweden by 2027. However, the computer science research community has yet to prioritize energy efficiency in AI model development.

Assistant Professor Raghavendra Selvan from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen is researching ways to reduce AI's carbon footprint. He points out that developers currently focus on building AI models that are effective in terms of accuracy, without considering their energy consumption. This narrow focus can lead to inefficient AI models.

In a new study, Selvan and computer science student Pedram Bakhtiarifard demonstrate that it is possible to reduce CO2 emissions significantly without compromising the precision of an AI model. This can be achieved by taking into account the climate costs during the design and training phases of AI models.

The researchers calculated the energy required to train over 400,000 convolutional neural network type AI models, which are commonly used for medical imagery analysis, language translation, object recognition, and face recognition. They present a benchmark collection of AI models that use less energy to solve a given task, while performing at roughly the same level.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scientists-amorphous-flexible-mini-inductor.html,Scientists develop novel amorphous flexible mini-inductor,Soft Magnetic Amorphous Mini-Inductor Development by NIMTE Research Team,"

In this age of technological advancements, the development of flexible mini-inductors is crucial for improving device performance, minimizing energy consumption, and realizing device miniaturization. However, conventional coils made of non-magnetic materials inevitably cause magnetic leakage, reducing inductance density and making them unsuitable for low-frequency applications.

To solve this problem, a research team led by Prof. Wang Junqiang at Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed an amorphous flexible mini-inductor using soft magnetic amorphous alloys. The study has been published in Advanced Functional Materials.

The amorphous flexibility of this mini-inductor allows it to maintain excellent mechanical properties while reducing magnetic leakage to less than 10^-4 T. This greatly minimizes interference between electronic components and ensures the device's superior stability.

The high permeability of the amorphous alloys increases the inductance density of the device to about 280-390 nH/mm2, which is about 10 times higher than that of conventional planar inductors. This makes the amorphous flexible mini-inductor an ideal solution for thin and light electronic products that require high inductance density in a small volume.

Moreover, the amorphous structure of the mini-inductor enables it to stretch by 300% of its original size and maintain its performance after 2,500 bending cycles at a 16-mm bending radius. This high flexibility ensures that the mini-inductor can adapt to various bending and folding application environments.

The development of the amorphous flexible mini-inductor not only provides a new application scenario for soft magnetic amorphous alloys but also highlights the material selection and device design of flexible electronics technology.

In conclusion, this study showcases the potential of amorphous soft magnetic alloys in the development of flexible mini-inductors with excellent mechanical flexibility, high inductance density, and superior stability. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of flexible electronics and pave the way for the development of new, innovative products.

In a breakthrough study, researchers harnessed magnetic forces to significantly improve clean energy production. The innovative approach, published in Nature Communications, revealed a 50% increase in activity for the crucial oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in green hydrogen production. By stirring reactants around the catalyst with Lorentz forces, the team overcame reactant scarcity limitations, paving the way for advanced sustainable energy technologies.","Title: Harnessing Magnetic Forces to Revolutionize Clean Energy Production

In the quest for sustainable energy solutions, the focus on enhancing fuel production processes has become increasingly critical. One such method that holds great promise is electrocatalysis, a key player in green-energy technologies that convert chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Electrocatalysis involves the use of catalysts to accelerate electrochemical reactions without being consumed, making it an essential component in devices like fuel cells and electrolyzers. These devices facilitate the conversion of fuels like hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, or water into hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, thereby enabling a cycle of clean energy.

However, a significant challenge remains: optimizing the transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface to maximize reaction efficiency. Traditional electrocatalysis methods often fall short in this aspect, which hampers progress towards clean energy goals. To address this issue, a team of researchers led by Magalí Lingenfelder at EPFL has developed an innovative approach that combines magnetic fields with electrocatalysis to improve the efficiency of clean fuel production.

Published in Nature Communications, the study demonstrates that surrounding catalysts with magnetic fields creates Lorentz forces, which induce whirling motions that enhance the movement of reactants and products at the catalyst surface. This results in more consistent and rapid reactions, overcoming limitations posed by reactant scarcity, a common hurdle in reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is critical for fuel cells.

To observe the movement of ions in real time under a magnetic field, the researchers employed an advanced magneto-electrochemical setup. By applying magnetic fields to non-magnetic electrodes and monitoring reactions, the scientists were able to decouple the different effects and observe how magnetic forces stir and enhance the movement of reactants around the catalyst. This process, akin to creating miniature whirlpools, significantly improves the efficiency of reactions crucial for green hydrogen production, offering a promising avenue for advancing sustainable energy technologies.

In the ever-evolving world of data storage, research groups from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University have achieved a significant breakthrough. They have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium, paving the way for increased storage capacity in hard disk drives (HDDs). This innovation could lead to more efficient and cost-effective data storage solutions in the future.

Presently, data centers rely heavily on HDDs that utilize perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) to store information at areal densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/in2. However, as we transition to higher areal densities, a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium, consisting of FePt grains combined with heat-assisted laser writing, is necessary. This method, known as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), can maintain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/in2. Moreover, densities greater than 10 Tbit/in2 are possible based on a new principle that stores multiple recording levels of 3 or 4 compared to the binary level used in HDD technology.

In their study, published in Acta Materialia, the team managed to arrange the FePt recording layers three-dimensionally by fabricating lattice-matched, FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer films, with Ru as a spacer layer. Measurements of the magnetization indicate that the two FePt layers have different Curie temperatures. This temperature difference enables three-dimensional recording by adjusting the laser power when writing.

The researchers also demonstrated the principle of 3D recording through recording simulations, using a media model that mirrors the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media. The three-dimensional magnetic recording method can increase recording capacity by stacking recording layers in three dimensions. Consequently, more digital information can be stored using fewer HDDs, leading to energy savings for data centers.

Apple is still on the hunt for its next big hit product to maintain its market dominance and generate new revenue streams after abandoning plans for an electric vehicle. One area the company is exploring is personal robotics. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple started looking into robots and electric vehicles at the same time, with the hope of developing a machine that doesn't require human intervention.

While Apple's robotics projects are still in the early stages, the company has already started working on a mobile robot that can follow users around their home and already developed a table-top device that uses a robot to move a screen around. The goal behind the latter is to have a device that can mimic head movements and lock on to a single person in a group, presumably for a better video call experience. Since these robots are supposed to be able to move on their own, Apple is also exploring the use of algorithms for navigation. According to the report, Apple's home devices group is responsible for their development, and at least one engineer who worked on its scrapped EV initiative has joined the team.

However, robots are not like smartphones in the sense that people don't need them in their daily lives. Apple is apparently concerned about whether people would be willing to pay ""top dollar"" for the robots it has in mind, and executives still can't agree on whether the company should continue working on these projects. Gurman previously reported that Apple may have sold its EV for $100,000 - if that's true, it had the potential to bring in significant revenue growth. However, the Apple Car is now out of the picture, and the company is focusing all its efforts on the Vision Pro and new home products, including a home hub device with an iPad-like display. Of course, Apple could still scrap these projects and find other areas of investment if it discovers that they have the potential to bring in even more significant revenue in the future.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-ultra-lowpower-memory-neuromorphic.html,Researchers develop a novel ultra-low-power memory for neuromorphic computing, Ultra-Low Power Phase Change Memory Boosts Neuromorphic Computing ,"Title: Revolutionizing Memory Devices: A Game-Changing Phase Change Memory Technology

A team of Korean researchers, led by Professor Shinhyun Choi from the KAIST School of Electrical Engineering, has developed a groundbreaking phase change memory device with ultra-low power consumption, paving the way for the next generation of artificial intelligence hardware and memory solutions. This innovative technology is detailed in a research paper published in the prestigious journal Nature.

Conventional phase change memory devices have faced significant challenges, including high fabrication costs and substantial power requirements for operation. To overcome these obstacles, Professor Choi's research team developed a novel approach to create an ultra-low power phase change memory (NFPCM) device, which features the formation of an ultra-small nanometer (nm) scale phase changeable filament without relying on expensive fabrication processes. This breakthrough technology offers not only a more cost-effective manufacturing process but also enables ultra-low power consumption during operation.

Traditional memory devices, such as DRAM, are known for their speed but suffer from volatile characteristics, meaning data is lost when power is turned off. On the other hand, NAND flash memory, a storage device, has relatively slow read/write speeds but offers non-volatile characteristics, allowing it to preserve data even when power is cut off. Phase change memory, however, combines the advantages of both DRAM and NAND flash memory, providing high speed and non-volatile characteristics. This unique combination makes phase change memory a promising candidate to replace existing memory technology and is a popular area of research for neuromorphic computing systems that mimic the human brain.

Unfortunately, conventional phase change memory devices require a substantial amount of power for operation, making it difficult to create practical large-capacity memory products or realize a neuromorphic computing system. While previous research efforts focused on reducing the power consumption of phase change memory devices by shrinking the physical size of the device through advanced lithography technologies, these attempts faced limitations in terms of practicality. Reducing the device's size resulted in minimal improvements in power consumption, while fabrication costs and difficulties increased with each improvement.

To tackle the power consumption challenges of phase change memory devices, Professor Choi's research team developed a method to electrically form phase change materials in an extremely small area, successfully implementing a NFPCM device that consumes 15 times less power than a conventional phase change memory device",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/researchers-develop-a-6.jpg,2024-04-04 10:04:57,"New nanometer-scale phase change memory (NFPCM) consumes 15 times less power, offering high-performance, non-volatile capabilities.

In a recent announcement, X's Safety team revealed that users might experience a decrease in their follower count. This development comes as the company embarks on a mission to eradicate accounts that infringe X's rules regarding platform manipulation and spam. The initiative, which began on April 4, 2024, aims to maintain the integrity and security of X by removing offending accounts.

X's renewed focus on eliminating spam and bots is not surprising, as it has been a long-standing concern for the company. Elon Musk, CEO of X, expressed his determination to tackle spam in November 2022, emphasizing its priority status. However, the challenge lies in the increased complexity of dealing with spam due to advancements in AI technology and a reduced workforce following significant job cuts.

Recent events have highlighted the growing problem of spam on X's platform. For instance, Musk's plan to monetize Verification did not deter spammers from participating. A TechCrunch report revealed that bots, displaying the coveted blue checkmarks, replied to posts with automated phrases, indicating their non-human nature. Moreover, a New York Intelligencer article detailed the increasing prevalence of spam promoting adult content, with bots posting explicit replies and linking to external websites.

Spam has been an ongoing issue for X, even causing Musk to question the platform's bot population when attempting to withdraw from the $44 billion Twitter deal. However, his recent statements celebrating record traffic fail to clarify whether these figures include bots and spam accounts.

As part of the cleanup initiative, X's Safety team announced that it would ""cast a wide net"" to remove spam and bots, which may result in reduced follower counts for some users. However, X has also provided a form for users who believe they have been affected inadvertently to appeal the decision.

In conclusion, X's latest efforts to eradicate spam and bots are a significant step towards a cleaner, safer platform for its users. While there may be temporary inconveniences, such as reduced follower counts, the long-term benefits of a more secure and authentic environment are invaluable.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bots-glitch-x-twitter.jpeg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-04 18:52:46,"""X combats spam & bots with account purge: Maintain integrity, secure your account!

Introduction:
Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) contribute just 5% of vehicles on the road in the United States but account for 21% of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing MHDV emissions is crucial to mitigating the effects of climate change and improving air quality. The zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) such as battery electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) offer a solution.

Body:
Economics play a vital role in choosing technologies for commercial vehicle applications. A recent study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) explored how the total cost of driving for zero-emission and diesel MHDVs could evolve over time under different scenarios from the present day to 2050. The study found that with continued improvements in vehicles and fuels, ZEVs are rapidly becoming commercially viable and could potentially reach total cost of driving parity or better compared to diesel vehicles by 2035 in all market segments.

NREL's Transportation Energy & Mobility Pathway Options (TEMPOTM) Model was used to estimate how the total cost of driving of MHDVs could evolve under a range of scenarios comprising technology cost and progress, fuel costs, and policies. The study captured differences in vehicle use and energy consumption across diverse MHDV market segments, which have distinctive technical and economic requirements.

The results of NREL's study are detailed in a recent iScience journal article ""Assessing Total Cost of Driving Competitiveness of Zero-Emission Trucks"" by Ledna and NREL's Muratori, Yip, Jadun, and Hoehne as well as Podkaminer from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Paving the way for zero-emission MHDVs is supported by various proposed and existing actions, including policies ranging from increased air quality and greenhouse gas emissions standards to tax credits for ZEV purchases as well as investments in research and development for ZEV technologies and infrastructure deployments. The IRA includes tax credits of up to $40,000 for qualifying clean vehicle purchases, including EVs and FCEVs, as well as incentives for charging and refueling infrastructure. More recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed more stringent greenhouse gas emission rules for model years 2027 to 2032 MHDVs.

Setting up a new device can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to configuring privacy settings. In this blog post, we will explore the privacy settings involved in setting up a MacBook running macOS 10.15+. We will also delve into a recent study conducted by Aalto University that investigates the privacy settings of Apple's default apps.

Privacy has always been a significant concern for users when setting up a new device. The study by Aalto University aimed to investigate the privacy settings of Apple's default apps, which are an integral part of the platform and ecosystem. The researchers focused on eight apps: Safari, Siri, Family Sharing, iMessage, FaceTime, Location Services, Find My, and Touch ID.

The study found that the fragility of the privacy protections was surprising, even to the researchers. Users are not aware of what data is being collected by each app, and enabling or disabling some features can lead to data collection in the background. For example, enabling Siri's voice control only refers to whether the user uses Siri's voice control. Siri collects data in the background from other apps the user uses, regardless of the user's choice.

Participants in the study were unable to stop data sharing in any of the apps, and finding and adjusting privacy settings took a lot of time. The online instructions for restricting data access are complex and confusing, with the necessary steps scattered across different places. There is no clear direction on whether to go to the app settings, the central settings, or both.

The researchers also demonstrated that the problem can be solved to some extent by opting for a third-party service. For example, users can use a third-party service to configure privacy settings for individual apps.

In conclusion, setting up a new device can be a complex process, especially when it comes to configuring privacy settings. The study by Aalto University highlights the fragility of the privacy protections and the need for Apple to improve its guidelines and instructions for users. By providing more detailed and clear information on privacy settings, Apple can help users protect their data and maintain their privacy.

Therefore, it's essential to understand the privacy settings involved in setting up a new device, especially when it comes to Apple's default apps. By taking the necessary steps to configure privacy settings, users can protect their data and maintain their privacy.

Introduction

The Gulf Coast of the United States is no stranger to tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. These phenomena can cause widespread power outages, disrupting daily activities and causing significant economic losses. With climate change and global warming on the rise, the frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events are expected to increase. A recent study by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany aimed to investigate the impact of extreme weather events on the Texas power grid. The study, published in Nature Energy, could guide local government and engineers in increasing the resilience of the electricity grid in Texas.

The Importance of Identifying Critical Lines

Extremely windy weather events can cause significant damage to transmission lines and towers, which often leads to further system and infrastructure failures, resulting in widespread blackouts and power outages. The researchers focused on extreme wind events and their impact on transmission lines in the Texas power grid.

""The damage caused by extremely windy weather events to transmission lines often leads to further system and infrastructure failures, resulting in widespread blackouts and power outages,"" said Mehrnaz Anvari, the author who coordinated the research. ""During these events, tens or even hundreds of transmission lines and towers can be damaged, contrasting with the N-1 or N-2 security rules that are applied to the power grid.""

The researchers' primary objective was to understand the interplay between evolving storm conditions and the partially destroyed state of the grid, requiring them to study the temporal-spatial structure of damages and outages – a topic with little preexisting research.

Identifying Critical Lines and Preventing Catastrophic Failures

The researchers based their study on a key intuition rooted in complex systems research: if a complex but robust system fails due to external stresses, it typically does so following fairly well-defined patterns or failure modes. By identifying these failure modes, they hoped to prevent such catastrophic failures.

Concretely, the researchers identified lines that were critical for keeping the system operational, or, to put it another way, the lines whose failure during the hurricane was most likely to trigger large-scale blackouts",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/exploring-the-resilien.jpg,2024-04-04 06:50:01,"Meta Description:

The AI-Enabled Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Workforce Consortium, formed by Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP, along with six advisers, aims to help impacted workers find training programs and connect businesses with companies looking for their skillsets.
The consortium will provide organizations with knowledge about the impact of AI on the workforce and equip workers with relevant skills. The goal is to positively impact over 95 million individuals around the world over the next 10 years. While this is a significant goal, it is important to note that it is not specific and may be challenging to achieve.
The consortium will first analyze how AI has impacted 56 unidentified job roles that make up 80% of the top 45 job titles, based on job postings since last year. They will then make recommendations on how to move forward with ensuring workers have the necessary skills to meet the demands of the ICT companies.
It is no secret that workers around the world are being impacted by AI adoption. Several companies, including UPS and IBM, have already acknowledged that they are laying off or freezing hiring due to AI. In total, US companies have cut more than 4,600 jobs as they seek new AI-ready hires or replace positions with AI, according to a study earlier this year from outplacement companies Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
While consortium members acknowledged that lost jobs are a reality, they are hopeful that upskilling and reskilling support will help workers find new careers in other roles. Many jobs will be replaced entirely by AI, but there will also be new job roles created in the field of AI.
In conclusion, the AI-Enabled Workforce Consortium is an important step towards addressing the impact of AI on the workforce. While the specifics of how they will achieve their goal remain to be seen, it is clear that they are dedicated to ensuring that workers have the necessary skills to succeed in the digital economy.

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has been at the forefront of virtual reality technology for the past decade. In 2014, Facebook acquired Oculus VR, a startup that was developing virtual reality headsets. Since then, Meta has invested heavily in the development of virtual reality technology, including its own line of VR headsets, such as the Oculus Quest 2.

Despite the investment, Meta's virtual reality technology has not yet had a significant impact on the market. While the company has made some impressive advancements in VR technology, it has also faced significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges facing Meta is the high cost of virtual reality equipment, which can be a barrier to entry for many consumers.

Another challenge facing Meta is the lack of content available for virtual reality. While there are some great VR games and experiences available, there is still a long way to go in terms of the variety and quality of content available. This lack of content can make it difficult for consumers to justify the high cost of virtual reality equipment.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-tech-companies-artificial-general-intelligence.html,Tech companies want to build artificial general intelligence. But who decides when AGI is attained?, Can we achieve AGI? How to measure AGI? ,"Introduction:

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a futuristic concept that aims to create machines as broadly smart as humans or at least capable of performing many tasks as well as humans. With the rise of tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, the race to build AGI is gaining momentum. However, AGI also poses an existential risk to humanity. This article explores the concept of AGI, its definition, and how we know when it has been achieved.

What is AGI?

AGI is not a technical term but a concept that refers to AI systems that are at least as good as humans at nearly all cognitive tasks. Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist, prefers the term ""superintelligence"" for AGIs that are better than humans. AGI is not to be confused with generative AI, which describes AI systems that generate new documents, images, and sounds.

AGI was initially a concept in mid-20th century computer science, but as AI research branched into subfields that focused on specialized and commercially viable versions of the technology, such as face recognition and voice assistants, mainstream AI research turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence.

Are we at AGI yet?

Without a clear definition, it is hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved AGI. However, some experts believe that AGI will require technology that can perform just as well as humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning, and the ability to learn from experiences.

Some researchers are working to find consensus on how to measure AGI. One idea is to segment it into levels, similar to how car manufacturers benchmark the path between cruise control and fully self-driving vehicles. Other researchers are working on their own, with OpenAI giving its nonprofit board of directors the responsibility of deciding when its AI systems have reached the point at which they ""outperform humans at most economically valuable work.""

Conclusion:

In conclusion, AGI is a fascinating concept that could revolutionize the way we live and work. While the race to build AGI is ongoing, it is essential to ensure that technology is developed responsibly and ethically to avoid an existential risk to humanity. By working together and finding consensus on how to measure AGI, we can ensure that this technology is developed to its full potential while minimizing its risks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/tech-companies-want-to.jpg,2024-04-04 14:15:03,"""Discover the Future of AI: Unraveling the Concept and Progress of Artificial General Intelligence.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-new-google-search-powered-by-next-gen-ai-may-be-subscription-only/,The new Google search powered by next-gen AI may be subscription-only, Google Explores AI-Powered Premium Search Features Amid Rising Competition ,"Title: Google's Potential Shift Towards AI-Powered Premium Search Features

Google, the search engine titan, has built its empire on providing free services to users worldwide. However, in response to the emerging threat of generative AI models, Google is contemplating a significant change to its business model. According to a Financial Times report, Google is considering implementing a paywall to access new AI-powered features in its search engine.

Google's AI-driven future

Google's engineers are actively developing advanced AI technology to enhance its search engine's functionality. However, the company's executives have not yet decided when, or even if, the paywall will be introduced. The new AI-powered features would be integrated into Google's premium subscription service, Google One, which currently costs $20 per month and offers various perks such as 2TB of storage, AI-infused productivity app assistance, and Google Meet premium video calling features.

The rise of free competitors

The potential introduction of a paid search tier is a notable departure from Google's long-standing business model, which has kept its search engine free since its inception over two decades ago. However, the cost of deploying and maintaining generative AI features on its search engine is substantial. Moreover, there is no guarantee that users would be interested in such an AI-assisted search service, especially with several free competitors on the market.

One such competitor is ChatGPT, which recently removed the need for logins, making it even more accessible to users. ChatGPT offers conversational and thorough answers to users' questions before January 2022, which could be an attractive alternative to Google's traditional search engine. Another strong competitor is Microsoft's Copilot, which can answer all search prompts conversationally, has access to the latest information, and remains a free-to-access service.

Experience Google's AI-infused search engine for free

Despite the possibility of some AI-infused search features being added to Google's premium subscription service, users can still experience Google's AI-powered search engine for free by signing up for the Search Generative Experience (SGE) via Google's Search Labs. To get started, simply log in with your Google account and explore the AI-enhanced search engine without any cost.
