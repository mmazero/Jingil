","Title: Tackling Misinformation and Deepfakes Amidst India's Historic Elections

Introduction

As India commences the world's most extensive democratic exercise, concerns regarding misinformation threaten to undermine the integrity of this monumental event. With a massive internet user base surpassing 830 million individuals, the nation faces unprecedented challenges due to rising misinformation and the emergence of 'deepfakes.' This article explores the current state of misinformation in India, its implications for the ongoing elections, and potential solutions to mitigate this pervasive issue.

The Problem of Misinformation and Deepfakes

According to the World Economic Forum, India ranks high in terms of susceptibility to misinformation and disinformation risks. Alarmingly, artificial intelligence has exacerbated the situation, giving birth to highly convincing deepfakes fabricated using advanced generative AI technology. Beyond merely jeopardizing free and fair elections, misinformation can lead to dire consequences, sparking real-world violence and fueling animosity towards marginalized communities.

Pratik Sinha, co-founder of Indian fact-checking organization Alt News, highlights an escalation in intentional dissemination of false information designed to sow discord in society. As stated, ""ever since social media has been thriving, there is a new trend where you use misinformation to target communities."" Furthermore, linguistic and cultural diversity poses additional hurdles for fact-checkers attempting to monitor and flag deceptive content.

Government Intervention and Enforcement Challenges

While the Indian administration has introduced measures aimed at combatting misinformation, doubts linger concerning effective implementation. In 2022, updates to IT intermediary guidelines mandated prompt removal of dubious material by social media firms following reports. Regrettably, inconsistencies in enforcement persist, raising questions about the regulations' overall efficacy. Critics contend that ambiguity surrounding these policies could result in arbitrary interpretations, impinging upon freedom of expression.

Contribution of Big Tech Platforms

Despite efforts by Google and Meta to curtail misleading content on their respective platforms, several gaps remain. Restrictions imposed on AI chatbots addressing poll-related queries represent laudable progress; however, neither company has outlined significant modifications to combat the surge of falsified information directly. Notably, recent reductions in financial support for fact-checking initiatives on applications such as WhatsApp compound existing difficulties.

Rising Prevalence of Cheapfakes

Alongside deepfakes, another class of altered multimedia content known as 'cheapfakes' floods social networking sites in India. Hamsini Hariharan, an analyst at British fact-checking firm Logically, describes cheapfakes as ""content generated with less sophisticated measures of altering images, videos, and audio,"" often propagated extensively across various platforms. These shallow fakes may prove equally detrimental in swaying voters' opinions and heightening societal tensions.

Addressing the Infodemic

To counteract the deluge of misinformation plaguing India's elections, concerted action must be undertaken by multiple stakeholders. Governments, tech giants, and civil societies all share responsibility in preserving open dialogue while simultaneously safeguarding the sanctity of truthful reporting. A few recommendations include:

1. Strengthening regulatory frameworks governing social media companies operating within national borders. Such legislation should prioritize transparency, enabling swifter identification and elimination of questionable materials.

2. Encouraging collaborations between tech companies and independent third-party fact-checkers. By fostering synergies between these entities, improved detection rates and expedient removals can be achieved.

3. Investing in educational campaigns centered around enhancing critical thinking skills among netizens. Empowering individuals to parse through digital content critically will contribute significantly toward building immunity against misinformation.

Conclusion

With India embarking on a historic electoral journey, the urgency of tackling rampant misinformation becomes paramount. Leveraging collective wisdom and resources, stakeholders possess both the opportunity and capability to rein in the infodemic threatening the very essence of democracy – informed choice making. Through robust regulation, industry collaboration, and grassroots education, we can strive together to preserve authenticity amidst the cacophony of voices vying for attention in today's hyperconnected world.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/india-election-2024-getty.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-20 12:00:27,"Mitigating India's Election Misinformation: A Call to Action

Introduction

Staying informed about the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI) industry is a challenging task. This roundup aims to keep you updated on the latest developments in machine learning, noteworthy research, and significant stories you might have missed.

Meta's Llama 3 Models: Open Source or Restricted?

Meta recently introduced Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B, part of its Llama series of generative AI models. These models can analyze and write text, with Meta positioning them as a ""foundational piece"" for developers. However, Meta's claim of ""open sourcing"" these models is misleading, as the company has imposed licensing restrictions on their use. For instance, Llama models cannot be used to train other models, and developers with over 700 million monthly users must request special permission.

The term ""open source"" has been a subject of debate, especially in the AI space. A study by Carnegie Mellon, AI Now Institute, and Signal Foundation revealed that many AI models marketed as ""open source"" have restrictions, data secrecy, and high computational and labor costs for fine-tuning. The challenge lies in defining open source regarding AI, as copyright and the components of AI projects are still under discussion.

Big tech companies like Meta co-opting the term ""open source"" can lead to centralized power, free marketing, and technical benefits for the companies, while the open-source community receives minimal advantages. AI projects should aim to democratize technology, rather than entrench already existing power dynamics.

Seraphim Space, the UK-based space tech investment group, has announced the launch of its second VC fund following its first close with limited partners, including Eutelsat. This early-stage fund aims to build a global portfolio of 30 startups, providing seed and Series A stage funding. While the exact size of the fund remains undisclosed, it is expected to surpass Seraphim Space's previous £70 million VC fund from 2017.

A Competitive Landscape and Strong Track Record

In the current market, space startups and the broader market are gaining traction, with a potential worth of $1.8 trillion by 2035, up from $630 billion in 2023, according to a World Economic Forum and McKinsey report. With increased investor awareness and a growing number of funds willing to invest in space tech, Seraphim Space aims to stand out with its successful track record. The first fund returned three times the original investment, which helped dispel the notion that space investment is ""super high risk and super long term.""

Challenges in the Public Market

However, the current public market conditions present challenges for both Seraphim Space's portfolio companies and the investment group itself. Seraphim Space Investment Trust (SSIT), the firm's growth fund, listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2021 with £250 million in gross proceeds. Due to market fluctuations, its market cap has dropped to £130 million despite its largest holding, ICEYE, achieving EBITDA profitability in 2022. These conditions have forced SSTI to focus on follow-on investments instead of new deals.

Leveraging Warehouse Arrangements and Focusing on Key Themes

Through a warehouse arrangement, SSIT funded nine investments made by SSV II before its first close. This approach has demonstrated Seraphim Space's investment thesis beyond the typical conflation of space with launching rockets and satellites.

SSV II will focus on four main themes:

Introduction

Venture capital (VC) activity in Africa has demonstrated remarkable resilience despite the global funding winter. Notably, TLcom Capital, an Africa-focused VC firm, has successfully closed its second fund, TIDE Africa Fund II, raising $154 million, making it the largest investor in early-stage startups on the continent. This article delves into TLcom Capital's recent achievements, investment strategies, and the positive impact of its activities on the African startup ecosystem.

TIDE Africa Fund II: A Milestone for TLcom Capital

TLcom Capital recently concluded the fundraising for its second fund, TIDE Africa Fund II, amassing a total of $154 million, surpassing its initial target of $150 million. The oversubscribed fund attracted over 20 limited partners, including the European Investment Bank (EIB), Visa Foundation, Bertelsmann, and AfricaGrow, a joint venture between Allianz and DEG Impact. This achievement positions TLcom Capital as Africa's largest investor across seed and Series A stages.

Improved Understanding and Acceptance of VC in Africa

Maurizio Caio, managing partner at TLcom Capital, attributes the firm's success to an enhanced understanding and acceptance of venture capital in Africa as a legitimate asset class among limited partners. Furthermore, TLcom Capital's portfolio of companies, which exemplify its investment strategy, has played a crucial role in garnering investor confidence and support.

Consistent Investment Strategy and Risk Management

Unlike many VC firms that progress from backing startups in pre-seed and seed stages to later-stage investments with subsequent funds, TLcom Capital maintains a consistent strategy. The firm continues to prioritize early-stage opportunities, particularly at the seed and Series A stages. TLcom Capital also focuses on risk management by backing repeat founders and investing earlier in deals, at the pre-seed stage, to secure a pipeline of potential investments.

Introduction

In this digital age, it's not uncommon to share the details of our lives with our friends and family, especially when it comes to dating. From sharing screenshots of profiles to discussing upcoming dates, our loved ones often play a significant role in our romantic lives. Enter Tinder's newest feature: Share My Date, designed to streamline the process of sharing your dating plans and ensuring your safety.

The Share My Date Feature

Tinder recently introduced Share My Date, a new feature that allows users to share their date plans directly from the app. With just a few taps, users can create a link containing essential details about their upcoming date, including the match's name, meeting location, date, and time. A notes section also enables users to add any additional information they'd like to share.

These shareable links can be sent up to 30 days before the date and are fully editable, allowing users to update details as needed. The links are viewable for every recipient, including non-Tinder users, who can see a limited version of the match's profile, including their photos, name, and age.

A Safe and Respectful Approach

The Share My Date feature expires after a certain period, discouraging users from sharing the link on social media. This thoughtful design choice aims to prioritize user safety and privacy while still enabling users to share their plans with their loved ones.

Share My Date was inspired by Tinder user data, which revealed that 51% of singles under 30 share the details of their dates with friends and family beforehand. By simplifying this information-sharing process, Tinder aims to create a more enjoyable experience for its users, from selecting an outfit to brainstorming conversation topics.

Global Rollout and Current Market Trends

The Share My Date feature is set to roll out across various countries, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, Spain, Italy, and many more. The launch comes at a time when dating apps are experiencing slow growth, with Tinder's total number of paying customers dropping by 8% year over year as of Q4 2023.
