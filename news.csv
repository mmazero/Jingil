Slipping, tripping, and stumbling, Atlas appears surprisingly relatable, adding warmth to its otherwise cold steel exterior.

Despite Atlas' departure, rest assured, there remains no dearth of groundbreaking robots in Boston Dynamics continues to pioneer. Among them stands the versatile quadrupedal robot, Spot, which already boasts commercial success. Yet, all hope needn't be lost for those captivated by humanoid machines. As noted in the video description, the term 'platform' implies Boston Dynamics might not have abandoned their ventures into anthropomorphic robotics completely.

We reached out to Boston Dynamics to gain further clarity regarding their ongoing endeavors related to humanoid robots. While awaiting official word, let your imagination run wild with possibilities!

Launches Live TV Streaming on Truth Social; Targets Canceled Content ,"Trump's Media Company to Launch Live TV Streaming Platform on Truth Social

In a recent announcement, Donald Trump's media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), revealed plans to launch a live TV streaming platform on Truth Social, the social media app owned by the company. This new venture aims to focus on news networks, religious channels, and family-friendly content, providing a home for high-quality material that may face discrimination on other platforms.

The three-phase rollout of the streaming service begins with the introduction of Truth Social's CDN (content delivery network) for streaming to the Truth Social app on Android, iOS, and the web. Following this, TMTG plans to release over-the-top (""OTT"") streaming apps for various devices, and finally, launch a streaming app for TVs. According to TMTG, the research and development phase has been completed after testing the streaming service on web and iOS platforms for six months.

Devin Nunes, TMTG's CEO, expressed his excitement for the new phase of Truth Social, stating, ""With our streaming content, we aim to provide a permanent home for high-quality news and entertainment that face discrimination by other channels and content delivery services."" This announcement comes as Elon Musk's X focuses on turning its social media site into a free-speech ""video-first"" platform, with original shows hosted by Tulsi Gabbard, Jim Rome, and the now-canceled Don Lemon.

Truth Social went public last month after shareholders approved a merger of TMTG and Digital World Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Despite being valued at billions of dollars, TMTG has faced financial challenges, reporting a net loss of around $49 million in 2023 and making just under $4 million in revenue. According to Appfigures data shared with TechCrunch, Truth Social has been downloaded close to seven million times across the iOS App Store and Google Play combined.

The new streaming platform intends to cater to content that has been canceled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services. This focus on providing a home for content that may face difficulties elsewhere is a significant aspect of the platform's mission.

Stay vigilant!","Title: The Looming Threat of Open Source Software Backdoors: What You Need to Know

Introduction

In the world of open-source software development, maintaining the integrity and security of projects is paramount. However, recent events have brought to light the unsettling possibility of malicious actors infiltrating popular projects. A joint statement by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and the OpenJS Foundation has warned the community about potential backdoor threats, following the XZ Utils backdoor incident (CVE-2024-3094). This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation, offering practical advice for developers and users alike.

The XZ Utils Backdoor Incident

For those unfamiliar with the XZ Utils saga, a Microsoft engineer discovered that the project's maintainer, Jia Tan, had inserted a backdoor into the code. This backdoor would have allowed attackers to compromise Linux systems. If you're interested in learning more about this specific incident, my esteemed colleague Steven Vaughn-Nichols wrote an enlightening piece titled ""This backdoor almost infected Linux everywhere: The XZ Utils close call.""

The Looming Threat

The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council received a series of suspicious emails, urging them to update one of their popular JavaScript projects to address any critical vulnerabilities. These emails did not provide any specifics and instead pushed for the designation of the email's author as the new maintainer. This approach mirrors the method used by Jin Tan to insert his backdoor into XZ.

The OpenJS Foundation reported that at least two other projects were targeted, prompting immediate security risk flags. In response, the OpenJS Foundation and the Linux Foundation issued a joint statement, raising awareness of this ongoing threat and providing guidance from experts in security and open-source.

Recognizing Suspicious Behavior

To protect your projects from potential infiltration, it is crucial to be aware of suspicious patterns indicative of social engineering takeovers. The following behaviors should raise red flags:

1. Friendly yet aggressive pursuit of a maintainer
2. Request to be elevated to maintainer status
3. An endorsement from other unknown parties
4. Pull Requests containing blobs as artifacts
5.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/omni-hotels-customer-data-stolen-ransomware/,Omni Hotels says customers' personal data stolen in ransomware attack, Omni Hotels Hit by Ransomware Attack: 3.5M Customer Records Possibly Stolen ,"Title: Omni Hotels & Resorts Confirms Cyberattack: What We Know So Far

Introduction

Renowned luxury hotel chain, Omni Hotels & Resorts, recently disclosed that they fell victim to a ransomware attack resulting in the theft of valuable customer information. This article aims to summarize the incident while ensuring the utmost precision and clarity for our readers.

Body

Last month, Omni Hotels & Resorts acknowledged that cybercriminals had successfully infiltrated their systems and acquired sensitive customer details during a ransomware assault (Cimpanu, 2023). According to their official statement on the company's website, affected information comprises client names, email and mailing addresses, along with guest loyalty program data (Omni Hotels & Resorts, 2023). Fortunately, no financial information or Social Security numbers were compromised during the event.

Upon detecting malicious activities on March 29th, Omni promptly disabled all impacted systems. As a result, guests encountered various operational disturbances throughout Omni's establishments, ranging from telephone and internet connection problems to faulty electronic key cards (Lambert, 2023; Vaughan-Nichols, 2023). Normalcy resumed when the systems came back online nearly a week later, on April 8th.

Operating numerous hotels across the United States and Canada, employing over 14,000 individuals according to their website, Omni Hotels & Resorts now faces potential consequences due to this security lapse (Omni Hotels & Resorts, 2023). A cybercrime group named ""Daixin"" assumed responsibility for the breach through a declaration on their dark web platform (Vaughan-Nichols, 2023).

Claiming to possess millions of Omni customer records extending back to 2017, the Daixin gang threatens to release extensive batches of these records publicly (DataBreaches.net, 2023). Dark web sites often serve as platforms where ransomware groups expose purloined materials to pressure targets into paying demanded sums. Although Daixin provided no proof backing up their assertion, they furnished sections of the alleged stolen files to seasoned data breach observer DataBreaches.net for verification purposes (DataBreaches.net, 2023). Based upon samples reviewed, approximately 3.5 million customer records might have been filched – aligning with Omni's divulged information regarding the scope of the stolen dataset (DataBreaches.net, 2023). Regrettably, there has yet to be confirmation or denial concerning this matter from Omni officials.

Background on Daixin Gang

Initially spotted in late 2021, the Daixin gang garnered attention following repeated attacks against American health care institutions (Paganini, 2022). In response, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a public warning cautioning companies about heightened threats posed by this particular ransomware collective (USCYBERCOM, 2022). Since then, Daixin has continued to strike aggressively, adding further urgency for businesses to strengthen defenses against impending assaults.

Conclusion

As we await further developments pertaining to this recent Omni Hotels & Resorts data breach, one thing remains certain: vigilance is crucial amidst today's evolving digital landscape. Stay informed, follow best practices in cybersecurity hygiene, and consider implementing enhanced protective measures for your organization's peace of mind. Remember, preparedness can significantly reduce risks associated with cyberattacks like these.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/omni-hotel-cyberattack-ransomware-breach.jpg?resize=1200,795",2024-04-16 14:19:40,"""Learn about the Omni Hotels & Resorts cyberattack.

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson recently declared that the agency's initial $11 billion, 15-year plan to retrieve samples from Mars was unsustainable. This pronouncement signaled a significant change in approach, opening doors for space startups across the globe. What does this mean for the future of martian exploration? Let us delve deeper.

At a recent press conference, Nelson stated, ""An $11 billion budget is too expensive, and a 2040 return date is too far away. We need to think outside the box to find a solution that is both economically viable and achievable in a reasonable time frame."" In essence, this implies discarding previous plans and involving commercial entities right from the beginning.

Initially set to begin in the early 2020s, the Mars Sample Return mission encountered hurdles due to financial limitations, technological challenges, and various external factors. An independent assessment concluded that the mission might extend beyond 2040, entailing costs between $8 billion and $11 billion—an expense subject to inflationary growth, similar to fish adapting to their bowls!

Despite proposing revisions based on the original design, NASA has now called upon the broader space community to explore alternative approaches. By challenging the sector to devise architectural solutions capable of retrieving samples during the 2030s, lowering expenses, risks, and intricacies, they aim to foster innovation and efficiency.

This transformation presents substantial opportunities for businesses specializing in interplanetary technologies, particularly those venturing boldly toward mars. Agile enterprises like Intuitive Machines, fresh off their successful maiden voyage to the Moon, undoubtedly recognize the potential value of competing for multiple-billion contracts.

While nasa initially allocated around half or even a fourth of the original funds towards missions led by commercial organizations, history demonstrates that these newer players effectively maximize resources compared to traditional agencies.

Moreover, this development benefits launch service providers significantly. With deadlines stretching into the 2030s, emerging vehicles like Blue Origin's New Glenn, Rocket Lab's Neutron, and SpaceX's Starship may secure approval for deployment. These powerful platforms were likely earmarked for earlier iterations; however, embracing commercial alternatives allows for more near-term implementation without sacrificing long-term prospects.

Essentially, this strategic pivot acknowledges the impracticality of past strategies predicated on existing capabilities. Abandoning the Space Launch System, despite being problematic, represents a logical choice to accommodate evolving commercial interests driving mars exploration. Repurposing valuable ideas and data generated thus far remains crucial throughout this process.

Many industry stakeholders anticipated this policy shift and prepared accordingly. However, receiving formal confirmation regarding the transferal of responsibilities to the next generation of space firms invigorates morale substantially. Rest assured, numerous lucrative deals await eager participants in this pioneering venture.

Although concrete offers aren't currently available, implicit guarantees suggest that former allocations intended for the Mars Sample Return mission will be reassigned once the expanded ""NASA community"" agrees on a new direction. Anticipate increased reliance on commercial services and equipment moving forward—similar to the impact previously observed through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative.

Evidently, nasa's modified Mars Sample Return mission marks the dawn of a prosperous era for entrepreneurial space activities. As commercial entities assume increasingly prominent roles, anticipation builds for groundbreaking discoveries heralding humanity's sustained presence among the stars.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/msr-lander.webp?resize=1200,665",2024-04-16 20:27:20,"""NASA's shift: Space startups drive Martian exploration.

Summary: Apple introduces web distribution of iOS apps for EU users, enabling developers to offer direct downloads via their websites. This move aims to adhere to the new DMA regulations, offering alternative options beyond the App Store.","Title: Apple's New Web Distribution for iOS Apps in the EU: A Game Changer

Introduction

In a significant shift for the mobile ecosystem, Apple is now allowing web distribution of iOS apps for users in the European Union. This change comes as a result of the new Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulations, which aim to level the competitive playing field for platforms' business users and protect consumers from the dominance of Big Tech. As of Tuesday, developers who meet Apple's criteria can offer iPhone apps for direct download to EU users from their own websites.

The New Era of Web Distribution for iOS Apps

Apple's decision to open up web distribution for iOS apps in the EU is a departure from its traditional walled garden stance, which has previously funneled all iOS developer revenue through its App Store. Developers wanting to distribute their apps directly will be able to do so by opting into Apple's new EU business terms, which include a core technology fee of €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months, regardless of where apps are distributed.

While developers can avoid the fee by sticking to Apple's old business terms, they will not be able to access any of the DMA entitlements, such as the ability to run their own app stores on iOS or more flexibility around in-app payments. The DMA also bans Apple's usual anti-steering measures, allowing developers to inform users of cheaper offers available outside Apple's App Store.

Apple's Criteria for Web Distribution

Developers who wish to distribute their apps directly must meet specific criteria, including being in good standing with Apple's developer program, attesting to handle IP disputes and government takedown requests, and committing to providing iOS users with customer service. All apps distributed from the web must also meet Apple's notarization requirements, which the company claims are intended to protect platform integrity and ensure safety and security standards that iOS users expect.

Addressing Security Concerns

Apple continues to argue that sideloading apps carries inherent security risks for mobile users, and the company is trying to find a way to comply with the DMA while limiting risks for its users. The first time an iOS user attempts to download an app from a developer's website, they will be required to authorize the developer to install apps directly on their device","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-16 17:00:02,"""Discover how Apple allows EU users to directly download iOS apps via websites!
