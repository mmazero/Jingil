Superhuman's AI-Powered Instant Replies: A Game-Changer for Email Efficiency

In the realm of email management, Superhuman, a pioneering startup, is making waves with its latest innovation: AI-powered instant replies. This feature is designed to streamline your email workflow, enabling you to respond to emails swiftly and effectively.

Superhuman's instant replies feature provides you with three contextual response options when you hit reply. These options are tailored to the specific content of the email you've received, making them highly relevant and personalized. Unlike generic smart replies, Superhuman's AI takes into account the context and tone of the email, ensuring that your responses are appropriate and professional.

To illustrate how it works, consider this scenario: You receive an email asking you to speak on a panel discussion. When you click on the ""Interested"" option, Superhuman generates a complete sentence that includes the sender's name, expressing your interest and willingness to participate. This eliminates the need for you to type out a lengthy response, saving you precious time.

Superhuman's AI capabilities extend beyond instant replies. The company has introduced a suite of AI-powered features that enhance your email experience. Superhuman AI, for instance, assists you in crafting better emails by suggesting alternative phrasing, adjusting the length, and even changing the tone of your message.

The company's auto-summarize feature provides a concise one-line summary at the top of your emails, giving you a quick overview of the content without having to open the email. This feature is particularly useful when you're dealing with a large volume of emails and need to prioritize your responses.

Superhuman's commitment to AI innovation is evident in its roadmap. The company envisions a future where AI seamlessly integrates into your email workflow, automating repetitive tasks and providing valuable insights. This includes using AI agents to schedule appointments, draft complete emails on your behalf, and facilitate seamless collaboration within teams.

Superhuman's pricing strategy has remained consistent since its launch, with a subscription fee of $30 per month. However, the company is considering a price revision later this year. Additionally, Superhuman is exploring the development of specialized email clients tailored to specific professions, such as sales executives and customer managers, with integrations for popular platforms like Salesforce and Hubspot.

Superhuman's mission is to transform email from a mere productivity tool into a platform for effective collaboration. The company recognizes that traditional email systems are often siloed and lack collaborative features. Superhuman aims to change this by introducing features that enable seamless sharing, commenting, and reacting within email threads, fostering a more dynamic and interactive communication experience.

Superhuman's dedication to innovation and its focus on user experience position it as a frontrunner in the email management space. With its AI-powered features, Superhuman is redefining the way we interact with email, making it more efficient, personalized, and collaborative.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/subsets-uses-explainable-ai-to-help-subscription-media-companies-reduce-customer-churn/,Subsets helps subscription businesses reduce churn with 'retention experiments' and explainable AI,"

In today's digital landscape, subscription-based business models have become increasingly popular. However, these models come with unique challenges, such as the need to retain subscribers and reduce churn.

Enter Subsets, a Danish startup that aims to help companies bridge the retention gap in the subscription industry. Founded in 2022, Subsets utilizes explainable AI to identify subscribers at risk of churning and provides tailored experiments to entice them to stay.

This explainable AI technology allows companies to understand why subscribers might be considering leaving, enabling them to address specific concerns and improve their retention strategies.

Subsets has already gained traction, securing notable customers like the New York Times-owned Athletic and Danish newspaper Børsen. Recently, the company secured $1.65 million in pre-seed funding led by Nordic early-stage VC Upfin and Y Combinator (YC), further fueling its growth.

Subsets is currently focused on the digital media vertical, helping publishers, streaming platforms, and subscription apps retain their subscribers. The company plans to expand into other industries such as mobility, banking, and food delivery in the future.

To leverage Subsets, companies connect their internal systems, such as CRM, CMS, and billing, to provide subscriber data points. Subsets then analyzes this data to identify churn audiences and suggests retention experiments.

Non-technical teams can easily run these experiments on subsets of their subscriber base to determine effective strategies for reducing churn. Successful experiments are automated, ensuring continuous improvement in retention efforts.

Subsets' AI algorithms are built using gradient-boosting models and temporal sequencing methods, which combine multiple predictive models and incorporate time-related features. The company also utilizes frameworks from Elon Musk's xAI to make churn-driving behaviors understandable.

While Subsets doesn't currently use OpenAI's GPT.x models, it's exploring the integration of downstream functionality using the same foundational model that powers ChatGPT.

With the backing of YC and other investors, Subsets is poised for further growth. Its explainable AI-powered platform has the potential to revolutionize subscriber retention strategies, helping companies thrive in the subscription economy.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/alibaba-staff-offers-glimpse-into-life-of-llm-researcher-in-china/,Alibaba staffer offers a glimpse into building LLMs in China,"

In the realm of artificial intelligence, a fierce competition is unfolding between Chinese tech giants and their Western counterparts, particularly OpenAI. Alibaba, a prominent player in China's tech landscape, is making significant strides in developing its own Large Language Model (LLM), known as Qwen.

A recent post on X by Binyuan Hui, a researcher at Alibaba's Qwen team, offers a fascinating glimpse into the daily routine of an LLM developer. His schedule mirrors that of OpenAI researcher Jason Wei, revealing striking similarities in their work habits.

Both Hui and Wei start their days at 9 a.m. and work tirelessly until 1 a.m., dedicating their time to meetings, coding, model training, and brainstorming with colleagues. Even after returning home, they continue to experiment and ponder ways to refine their models, often well past bedtime.

While their work schedules are remarkably similar, their leisure activities differ. Hui spends his free time reading research papers and browsing X to stay updated on industry trends. Unlike Wei, he doesn't indulge in a glass of wine after work.

This intense work ethic is prevalent in China's LLM space, where top university graduates flock to tech companies to contribute to the development of competitive AI models. Hui's demanding schedule reflects his personal drive to match or even surpass Silicon Valley companies in the AI arena.

Kai-Fu Lee, a renowned AI investor and computer scientist, also exemplifies this dedication. During an interview, Lee revealed that late hours were the norm at his newly established LLM unicorn 01.AI, but employees willingly embraced the challenge.

The urgency to develop LLMs in China is evident in the rapid rollout of these models. Qwen, for instance, has open-sourced a series of foundation models trained with both English and Chinese data. The largest of these models boasts 72 billion parameters, demonstrating its vast knowledge and ability to generate contextually relevant responses.

Alibaba has also been quick to introduce commercial applications of its LLM. Last April, the company integrated Qwen into its enterprise communication platform Dingtalk and online retailer Tmall.

While no clear leader has emerged in China's LLM space, Alibaba is carving out a niche by focusing on multilingual capabilities. In December, the company released SeaLLM, an LLM capable of processing information in several Southeast Asian languages. This move could become a selling point, given Alibaba's strong presence in the region through its cloud computing business and acquisition of Lazada.

The race to develop LLMs is heating up, with Chinese tech companies determined to bridge the gap with Western pioneers like OpenAI. Alibaba's dedication to multilingualism and its researchers' relentless work ethic position the company as a formidable competitor in the global AI landscape.

In the vibrant heart of Dubai, COTU Ventures emerges as a beacon of support for budding startups in the Middle East. With a recently secured $54 million inaugural fund, this venture capital firm sets its sights on empowering entrepreneurs from the earliest stages of their ventures.

COTU Ventures, led by the visionary Amir Farha, seeks to nurture founders from the very inception of their ideas to the triumphant launch of their products. Investing between $500,000 and $2 million, the firm stands ready to provide additional capital for promising follow-on investments.

Over the past two and a half years, COTU Ventures has actively fueled the growth of startups across the GCC region, with a particular focus on the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan. Its portfolio boasts over 20 early-stage ventures spanning diverse sectors, each brimming with potential.

Amir Farha, the driving force behind COTU Ventures, reveals the firm's inclination towards fintech and B2B software, while remaining open to opportunities across other industries. Notable investments include Huspy, a UAE mortgage platform backed by Peak XV and Founders Fund, and MoneyHash, an Egyptian fintech startup poised for success.

""The consumer wave has already made its mark with Careem and other applications. Now, businesses need to catch up, presenting a vast opportunity for software solutions that can solve their challenges,"" Farha explains. ""We're also drawn to high-margin industries where technology can maximize efficiencies and drive profitability.""

Farha's journey in the venture capital realm began with Careem, the poster child of the MENA and GCC startup scene. As a VC at BECO Capital, he played a pivotal role in securing early investments in this ride-hailing giant.

After years of experience in corporate VC and angel networks, Farha launched BECO Capital in 2012. Under his leadership, the firm's first fund, backed by the Dubai government, achieved a successful return, with notable exits including PropertyFinder and Fresha. The second fund, boasting well-funded startups like Kitopi and MaxAB, continues to thrive.

As the GCC tech ecosystem matured, Farha recognized a gap in the market for early-stage support beyond mere funding. In 2020, he departed from BECO Capital to establish COTU Ventures, doubling down on his commitment to nurturing startups from their inception.

Farha believes that a founder's upbringing and life experiences offer valuable insights into their potential for success. At COTU Ventures, he fosters candid conversations that delve into founders' personal and professional journeys, exploring pivotal life events and decisions. This open dialogue builds trust and strong connections, enabling the firm to make informed investment choices.

COTU Ventures goes beyond financial investment, providing strategic guidance on fundraising, organizational development, and go-to-market strategies. The firm connects founders with key stakeholders, including customers, potential hires, and follow-on investors, ensuring comprehensive support as startups navigate their growth trajectory.

""I thrive in the chaos of early-stage ventures, where discovery, experimentation, and testing converge,"" Farha remarks. ""There's a gap in the market, and COTU Ventures aims to be the go-to partner for founders seeking early-stage support. We're committed to helping them achieve product-market fit and secure subsequent funding rounds.""

COTU Ventures has attracted a diverse group of limited partners, including Lunate, Mubadala, Dubai Future District Fund, Arab Bank, Bupa KSA, and GPs from renowned VCs like Foundry Group, Tribe Capital, and Stride.

Sharif Elbadawi, CEO of Dubai Future District Fund, expresses his confidence in COTU Ventures, lauding Amir Farha's exceptional leadership and track record. ""We're proud to support a fund that not only boasts an impressive portfolio but is also guided by Amir's unwavering passion for empowering founders and his uncanny ability to identify remarkable investment opportunities,"" Elbadawi states.

COTU Ventures stands as a beacon of hope for aspiring entrepreneurs in the Middle East, providing the necessary resources, guidance, and connections to transform their dreams into thriving businesses.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"

Title: The Supreme Court's Balancing Act: Content Moderation Laws Under Scrutiny

In the ever-evolving landscape of the internet, the Supreme Court finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the future of content moderation. Two state laws, one from Florida and the other from Texas, have ignited a heated debate over the boundaries of social media companies' authority to regulate content on their platforms.

The crux of the matter lies in the delicate balance between the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the need for responsible content moderation. The laws in question seek to limit the ability of social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, Yelp, and Etsy to remove or restrict certain types of content.

The underlying motivation behind these laws stems from accusations of anti-conservative bias among social media platforms. However, research has not substantiated these claims. Ironically, conservative social media users are more prone to political misinformation, potentially skewing their perception of ideological discrepancies in content moderation decisions.

The Supreme Court justices engaged in thoughtful discussions during the oral arguments, expressing skepticism about the broad nature of the state laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor raised concerns about the unforeseen consequences of such sweeping regulations, citing the vast diversity of online platforms. She highlighted Etsy as an example of a marketplace that could be adversely affected by these laws.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh emphasized the First Amendment's protection against government suppression of speech, underscoring the crucial role of this principle in the context of content moderation. Justice Neil Gorsuch, while seemingly more receptive to arguments against social networks, acknowledged the significance of Section 230, a law that safeguards internet companies' content moderation decisions.

However, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito appeared more inclined towards the states' arguments. Justice Alito questioned whether content moderation was merely a euphemism for censorship.

The outcome of these cases remains uncertain. The Supreme Court could issue a decisive ruling or opt to remand the cases back to lower courts for a full trial, a process that could potentially span years.

Regardless of the immediate outcome, the Supreme Court cannot avoid confronting the challenges posed by the digital age. The precedents guiding content moderation largely stem from traditional media like cable TV, newspapers, and utility companies, which differ significantly from internet businesses with vast user bases.

As technology continues to reshape society, the Supreme Court must adapt its First Amendment jurisprudence to address these evolving complexities. The court's eventual decision will have far-reaching implications for the future of content moderation and the broader landscape of the internet.

The Future of iPhone Displays: A Refreshing Change

Apple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus boast stunning displays, but their 60Hz refresh rate falls short compared to many rivals. However, a refreshing change is on the horizon, with rumors suggesting a significant upgrade in 2025.

The current 60Hz refresh rate on non-Pro iPhones has drawn criticism, especially considering that many cheaper competitors have already embraced faster refresh rates. Apple, however, has reserved its ProMotion screens exclusively for the Pro iPhone models.

According to a recent report, Apple plans to continue using 60Hz displays with Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon technology in the upcoming iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. However, the iPhone 17 series is expected to bring a major shift with the adoption of Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide panels across the board.

This change promises several benefits beyond the obvious improvement in refresh rates. The ProMotion displays' dynamic refresh rates enable features like the Always-On display, which conveniently shows the time, date, widgets, and a subtle version of the lock screen wallpaper without requiring you to touch the phone.

Furthermore, iOS 17 introduces a handy feature called StandBy. When an iPhone is charging and placed sideways on a compatible wireless charger, the display comes to life, displaying the time, calendar, photos, and widgets. This feature is particularly useful when you want to quickly check information without picking up the phone.

Currently, only the iPhone 14 Pro, Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, and Pro Max can fully utilize the Always-On display, keeping the screen active indefinitely. However, it seems that this feature will be extended to all iPhones in the near future.

The upcoming upgrade in iPhone displays is an exciting prospect for users who value smooth scrolling, seamless video playback, and the convenience of features like Always-On and StandBy. While we eagerly await the arrival of these advancements, we can appreciate the stunning displays that Apple has consistently delivered since the introduction of the Retina Display on the iPhone 4.

Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Auto Dealerships Thrive Amidst Digital Disruption

In a world increasingly dominated by digital transactions, the survival of traditional brick-and-mortar businesses has been a topic of debate. However, the automotive industry presents a surprising tale of resilience, as physical dealerships not only endured but also experienced a slight increase in 2023.

A recent study by Urban Science, an automotive consulting firm, revealed that the number of U.S. auto dealerships grew by 90 in 2023, reaching 18,347. This modest increase may seem insignificant, but it highlights the industry's ability to adapt and thrive amidst the rise of online car sales.

The study also found that dealerships sold more vehicles on average in 2023, indicating that consumers still value the in-person experience when purchasing a car. This trend is particularly notable given the predictions that online car sales would render physical dealerships obsolete.

However, the number of franchises, or brands offered by dealerships, decreased slightly in 2023. This suggests that dealerships are consolidating their offerings, focusing on brands that align with consumer preferences and market demand.

Despite these fluctuations, the overall stability of the auto dealership industry is a testament to the adaptability of dealers. They have successfully navigated the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the semiconductor chip shortage.

One key factor contributing to the resilience of dealerships is their ability to increase throughput, or the number of vehicles sold each year. Throughput has been on an upward trend since the pandemic, reaching an average of 851 vehicles sold per dealership in 2023. This increase in sales volume is a positive sign for the industry, although it still falls short of the pre-pandemic levels.

While increased volume may suggest higher profits, a report by J.D. Power indicates that total retailer profit per unit has declined due to rising inventory and fewer vehicles selling above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). This highlights the ongoing challenges dealerships face in maintaining profitability.

Another significant trend shaping the auto dealership industry is the transition to electrified vehicles. Dealers are adapting to this shift by investing in infrastructure and training to sell and service electric vehicles. While the move towards electrification presents challenges, it also offers opportunities for dealerships to embrace innovation and cater to evolving consumer preferences.

Despite the rise of online car sales, physical dealerships remain crucial for consumers who prefer the traditional car-buying experience. Millennials, in particular, have shown a preference for visiting dealerships, valuing the opportunity to see, touch, and test drive vehicles before making a purchase.

In conclusion, the auto dealership industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of digital disruption. Dealerships have adapted to changing consumer preferences, economic challenges, and technological advancements, ensuring their continued relevance in the automotive landscape. As the industry navigates the transition to electrified vehicles, dealerships are poised to play a vital role in shaping the future of car ownership and mobility.
