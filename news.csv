Undeniably, vertical SaaS is having a moment. Companies across industries have achieved unicorn valuations with cloud-based, industry-specific software expertly tailored to their customers’ unique needs. However, while the future might look bright for these companies, growth isn’t cheap. Customer acquisition costs are some of the largest growth expenses any tech company will face. That’s why, instead of hunting down new customers, the smartest move for vertical SaaS companies right now is to extract more value from existing customers. How? By going multi-product.

A multi-product strategy is exactly what it sounds like: a business strategy that revolves around multiple complementary products. These products are tailored to the customer’s particular industry and typically meet a need that would otherwise have been met by a more generic, horizontal piece of software.

One reason why a vertical SaaS company might start offering multiple products is pretty obvious—revenue. It is meaningfully cheaper to extract additional revenue from existing customers than it is to acquire new ones. However, there are many more benefits than just that.

Multiple integrated products create a form of ""ecosystem"" effect that can increase customer retention and drive loyalty. That’s because integrated software offers an inherently better experience, especially for business owners. Having all of your data available and one less piece of software to manage, when executed well, drives efficiency in a way that businesses really value.

There’s evidence to back this up, too. Research shows that organizations retain just 30% of their small- and medium-sized business clients over the course of two years when they offer a single product. However, expanding to just one additional product can increase that retention rate by nearly 20%, while expanding to four products delivers a retention rate of 80%.

When packaged well, multiple products can also help you acquire new customers. Your core product may not have offered all of the features these holdouts needed before, but now, with additional products, you can meet and even exceed their needs in an enticing way.

A strong multi-product strategy begins with your core software. The best candidates for going multi-product are companies whose software acts as the ""control point"" or ""source of truth"" for a particular business. This can look different across a variety of industries, but the most important piece is always the same—the data.

For a restaurant, the control point may be the order management system. In real estate, that could be the property management system. For gyms, that could be a member management system. The theme here is that this software aggregates an extremely important piece of data that you can leverage across additional products in a complementary way.

Going back to our earlier example of websites, the gym SaaS company may create a website builder that integrates directly with their software. This website would allow individuals to manage their membership, join the gym and even register for classes. All of this would be available without any development from the business owner.

You can probably see how this is a superior experience for the business owner than an off-the-shelf website builder. By leveraging your customer’s data and your knowledge of their particular vertical, you can create high-quality experiences that impress your customers and grow your business.

However, like all things, going multi-product is easier said than done. Sometimes, building software in-house will make the most sense. You can do it easily with minimal additional hires and a reasonable amount of ongoing expense. Other times, you simply can’t create something competitive in an otherwise saturated market.

That doesn’t mean you have to give up, though! There are plenty of opportunities for vertical SaaS companies to thrive in a competitive market. One option is to acquire another company. This can be an expensive option, but it allows you to quickly absorb a competent team and a quality product, reducing your go-to-market time. However, you must carefully consider ongoing costs and ensure that the acquired product generates enough profit to cover these costs.

Another option is to partner with another company. A good partnership can provide the benefits of an acquisition without the downsides. Look for partners whose software is high-quality, white-label, and easy to integrate. The goal is to create a seamless experience for your customers, where they are unaware that they are using another company's software.

In conclusion, now is the perfect time for vertical SaaS companies to develop a strong multi-product strategy. By offering multiple complementary products, companies can increase revenue, improve customer retention, and acquire new customers. Developing a successful multi-product strategy involves identifying your core software, understanding your customer's needs, creating complementary products, and considering build vs. buy options and partnerships. With a well-executed multi-product strategy, companies can create a comprehensive ecosystem that delights customers and drives business growth.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/02/23/att-t-mobile-geofence-orders/,"AT&T And T-Mobile Are Giving Cops Geofenced Location Data, Even Though It’s Inaccurate","

The Department of Justice has been using geofence warrants to obtain phone information from telecoms providers like AT&T and T-Mobile. These warrants require the providers to share location data of all customers who were in the vicinity of a crime. However, privacy advocates have raised concerns about the accuracy of this location data and the potential for innocent people to be implicated in major crime investigations.

Geofence warrants, also known as ""timing advance true call area search"" warrants, are used by law enforcement to identify suspects by requesting telecoms companies to search through records of phones connecting to cell towers near various crime scenes. The companies are then asked to determine which phones were close to the illegal activity by estimating the distance and direction of the signal from a device to a cell tower.

It is worth noting that location data from telecoms companies is often less accurate compared to Google's location data. In a recently unsealed warrant from Wisconsin, it was noted that location data from telecoms providers could be off by a significant margin, ranging from ""a few square blocks to several square miles."" In contrast, Google's location data is rarely off by more than a few feet.

Privacy advocates argue that the use of geofence warrants has the potential to sweep up innocent people in major crime investigations. The broad nature of these warrants and the potential for inaccurate location data raise concerns about the number of people who may be implicated in investigations. Critics argue that these warrants give law enforcement agencies unbridled discretion to determine who to target for further investigation.

Jennifer Lynch, general counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concerns about the broad scope of geofence warrants. In a Wisconsin case, where police were investigating two linked crimes, the warrants sought data on all phones at both locations, potentially implicating a significant number of people. Lynch emphasized the need for more targeted and specific warrants to avoid implicating innocent individuals.

Telecoms companies like AT&T, T-Mobile, and UScellular have been complying with these geofence warrants. AT&T spokesperson Dan Feldstein stated that they require the highest level of legal demand, a probable-cause warrant signed by a judge, except in emergency situations. UScellular spokesperson Katie Frey mentioned that the company provides timely and accurate responses to all lawful requests from law enforcement. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment.

With Google no longer able to respond to geofence warrants due to changes in how it stores and encrypts location data, it is likely that law enforcement agencies will increasingly rely on telecoms companies for this information. However, the limitations and potential inaccuracies of location data from telecoms providers may lead to mistakes and the potential rounding up of innocent individuals in investigations.

Brett Max Kaufman, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, highlighted the potential risks associated with using telecoms location data. He suggested that moving to a data store like cell site location information could result in mistakes and innocent people being implicated in investigations. The accuracy and reliability of location data will be crucial in ensuring that these warrants are used appropriately.

In conclusion, the use of geofence warrants by law enforcement agencies to obtain phone information from telecoms providers has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for innocent people to be implicated in major crime investigations. The accuracy of location data from telecoms companies compared to Google's location data has been a point of contention. Privacy advocates argue for more targeted and specific warrants to avoid implicating innocent individuals. As technology and legal frameworks continue to evolve, it is important to strike a balance between law enforcement needs and protecting individual privacy rights.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/23/the-halo-show-just-did-the-fall-of-reach-with-master-chief-in-a-t-shirt/,The 'Halo' Show Just Did The Fall Of Reach With Master Chief In A T-Shirt,"

The highly anticipated second season of Paramount Plus's Halo series has indeed shown improvement over its predecessor, but it still struggles with several perplexing moments that leave viewers scratching their heads. Despite an impressive episode 3, the transition into The Fall of Reach presented a mixed bag of storytelling, occasionally veering into outright absurdity and highlighting persistent issues that have plagued the show.

One recurring point of contention revolves around Master Chief, portrayed by Pablo Schreiber, who conspicuously shuns his iconic helmet and suit for a significant portion of the series. Schreiber defends this departure by arguing that conveying necessary emotions on television requires a more visible human face, a stance that the acclaimed show The Mandalorian and the beloved Halo games would likely dispute. This season, this departure reaches an extreme point when Master Chief finds himself battling the Covenant during The Fall of Reach sporting nothing more than a t-shirt and vest. The sight of Master Chief delivering his iconic line ""I need a weapon"" while flaunting only his biceps feels deeply unsettling.

The rationale behind this departure from the established lore stems from Master Chief being stripped of his armor due to insubordination. As a result, he and his team engage in battle in their ordinary attire, a stark contrast to the heavily armored marines fighting alongside them. While the episode features commendable action sequences, the absence of proper armor leads to a jarring outcome, as a fellow Spartan meets a gruesome demise from a single, seemingly trivial enemy attack.

The decision to sideline the iconic Spartan armor raises questions about the show's motives. Is it an attempt to foster a stronger connection between the actors and the audience, or is it a budgetary constraint? Does the cumbersome nature of the armor impede fluid action sequences, necessitating excessive CGI? The absence of proper armor during The Fall of Reach, a pivotal event in the Halo universe, amplifies the perplexity surrounding this departure from established canon.

However, the controversy does not end there, as the episode takes a significant deviation from the games by prematurely dispatching Admiral Keyes in a manner that diverges sharply from the source material. This departure has left fans incensed, as it remains uncertain how the show intends to navigate this critical deviation. Speculations abound, including the possibility of his daughter assuming his role, or the show opting to discard his significant contributions altogether, further straying from the established narrative.

While season 2 marks an improvement over its predecessor, it still falls short of its potential, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling narrative. The missed opportunity of this episode is particularly disappointing, given the rich source material at the show's disposal.

In the realm of environmental awareness, the convergence of environmental justice and Black-owned businesses stands as a pivotal focus. Black-owned businesses, deeply entrenched in their communities, hold a distinctive sway in championing environmental justice and sustainability. Their influence extends to shaping local economies, generating employment, and nurturing a sense of community empowerment. Often, these businesses and the communities they serve find themselves at the forefront of the environmental justice and climate crisis. With acknowledgment, funding, and opportunities, Black businesses not only contribute to the well-being of their immediate communities but also to the broader aspiration of a sustainable future.

The nexus between Black businesses and environmental justice transcends operational practices. Many Black entrepreneurs actively advocate for policies addressing environmental disparities and promoting equitable access to resources. Their role goes beyond economic contributions, positioning them as advocates for environmental justice, community well-being, and long-term sustainability.

Despite the significant role they play, Black businesses encounter distinct challenges in advancing environmental justice. Limited access to capital and resources, along with systemic barriers, present obstacles to the adoption of sustainable practices. However, infrastructures and innovations emerging from within the Black community are addressing some of these barriers. Capital is being directed towards climate and environmental justice issues, aiming to support Black entrepreneurs and nonprofit leaders.

Community development finance institutions, such as the Justice Climate Fund, are instrumental in championing the cause for low-income and disadvantaged communities. This fund, led by the African American Alliance of CDFI CEOs, endeavors to ensure that capital and resources reach those who have been marginalized. The success of this funding could act as a catalyst for a green and equitable economic transformation, positioning Black and Brown communities at the forefront of environmental resilience. Additionally, at the federal government level, technical assistance centers are being established to assist business owners and entrepreneurs in the environment services center access funds as part of the current administration’s “Investing in America” agenda.

Amidst these challenges lie significant opportunities for progress. The escalating awareness of environmental justice issues, coupled with the growing demand for sustainable products and services, presents a market ripe for innovation. Black businesses can leverage this demand not only to address environmental concerns but also to distinguish themselves and thrive in a market increasingly prioritizing sustainability.

The landscape of Black-owned businesses spearheading environmental justice and sustainability is teeming with inspiration. For instance, Golde, a Black-owned sustainable superfoods company, endeavors to make wellness accessible and enjoyable, countering the prevalence of food deserts in communities of color and the exclusion of healthy food items due to pricing. In the tech sector, Tech Recovery Pros, a Black-owned tech company, is making strides in addressing electronic waste issues by specializing in recycling and refurbishing electronics, thereby reducing environmental impact and creating job opportunities in communities in need.

As we navigate the future, the symbiotic relationship between environmental justice and the success of Black businesses becomes increasingly evident. The unique role that these businesses play in promoting sustainability and equitable practices is crucial for fostering thriving communities and a healthier planet.

In the face of challenges, the opportunities for Black businesses to lead the way in environmental justice are substantial. By advocating for supportive policies, embracing sustainable practices, and showcasing the positive impact on communities, Black businesses can pave the way for a future where environmental consciousness and economic success go hand in hand. The significance of environmental justice for the future of Black businesses transcends business operations; it is a commitment to building resilient, sustainable communities that thrive in harmony with the environment.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/23/wb-admits-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-our-expectations/,WB Admits ‘Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League’ Has ‘Fallen Short Of Our Expectations’,"

Warner Bros. is facing the aftermath of the critical and commercial failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a game developed by Rocksteady. During a financial call, WB CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels acknowledged that the game had fallen short of their expectations, creating a challenging year for the games business in comparison to the success of Hogwarts Legacy in 2023.

From the outset, Suicide Squad encountered critical difficulties, notably by not sending out review copies. Despite receiving higher user scores on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam, it failed to attract meaningful player numbers. The game's player count on Steam peaked at 13,459, significantly lower than comparable games like Marvel’s Avengers and Outriders. It struggled to maintain its position in Xbox's most-played games list, with the only notable success being its launch on PlayStation as a top game.

However, the game's player count has drastically declined since its launch. It has dropped out of the top 10 on PlayStation and top 50 on Xbox, with player numbers peaking at under 1,000 on Steam. This decline, just three weeks after its launch, poses a significant challenge for a live service game.

The failure of Suicide Squad has raised questions about its post-launch support and monetization strategy. With low player numbers and poor upfront sales, the prospect of sustaining the game's content and engaging players is uncertain. Additionally, a recent patch intended to address online play issues has further disrupted the game, intensifying its current problems.

The game's underperformance is particularly striking given the substantial investment of time and resources. The future of Suicide Squad remains uncertain, and its current challenges cannot be overlooked.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/23/remote-work-and-the-collaboration-conundrum/,Remote Work And The Collaboration Conundrum,"

The Covid-19 pandemic brought about a seismic shift in the way we work. Suddenly, we found ourselves thrust into a world of online meetings and remote work, redefining the future of work one Zoom call at a time. However, after two years, it became evident that fully remote operations didn't suit all businesses, especially those in financial services. Companies like Bank of America made the decision to bring employees back to the office five days a week, citing the need for a more collaborative environment that remote work couldn't fully provide.

The return-to-office debate quickly became contentious, with concerns about employers seeking greater control over their workforce and fixating on productivity metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of remote work. As someone who has built a career based on in-person interactions, I can attest to the challenges of leading a large organization in a remote setting. The absence of physical proximity has made it difficult to foster trust, engage in collaborative problem-solving, and pick up on non-verbal cues that are crucial for effective teamwork.

One of the key challenges in the new remote reality is the lack of casual collisions and impromptu interactions that often lead to breakthroughs and stronger team dynamics. Steve Jobs understood the value of these chance encounters, designing office spaces to encourage such unplanned brainstorms. These unstructured moments can be more effective in problem-solving than scheduled calls, fostering a stronger company culture and driving innovation.

The rapid shift to video conferencing tools like Zoom has been remarkable, but it has also highlighted the limitations of virtual communication. While these tools facilitate visual interaction, they fall short in replicating the full range of interpersonal communication skills and techniques. The pushback against return-to-office orders from CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Andy Jassy underscores the challenges of balancing remote work with the need for in-person collaboration.

Looking ahead, the future of business and work will undoubtedly involve advancements in artificial intelligence and technology. However, it's essential to recognize that there's no substitute for the creativity and problem-solving abilities of people. As we navigate this new landscape, it's crucial to reinvent our thinking and tools to harness the unique talents of individuals.

In conclusion, the evolving nature of work in the post-pandemic era presents both challenges and opportunities. While technology has enabled us to adapt to remote work, it's clear that the human element of collaboration, creativity, and connection remains irreplaceable. The companies that can decode these challenges and innovate to foster meaningful human interactions will be the ones to shape the future of work.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/23/the-new-sec-cybersecurity-disclosure-rule-is-live-now-what/,The New SEC Cybersecurity Disclosure Rule Is Live-Now What?,"

In today's digital age, the landscape of innovation is vast and brimming with opportunities. However, alongside these opportunities, there exists a looming threat of cyber incidents that can disrupt operations, compromise confidential information, damage reputations, erode trust, and result in significant financial costs. This is further complicated by the intricate web of vendors and partners that companies rely on, as each company becomes responsible for the actions of numerous others.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has introduced the ""Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure"" rule, which is now in effect. This rule underscores the potential of cybersecurity incidents to profoundly impact the operations, finances, and reputations of public companies. It emphasizes transparency, accountability, and responsible management of cybersecurity risks for public companies.

One of the key areas of uncertainty surrounding this new rule revolves around the concept of materiality. While not a new concept for publicly traded companies, the technical and cybersecurity leaders and practitioners have historically been somewhat removed from these discussions, making the concept somewhat abstract to them. To gain a better understanding of the rule, organizations need to delve into the meaning of materiality and its overall impact. Additionally, they should prepare themselves to ensure compliance despite the absence of a traditional playbook.

 Understanding ""Materiality"" and Its Impact
The SEC's decision to initiate a four-day disclosure clock upon deeming a cybersecurity incident as material—not upon its discovery—demands attention. Materiality, as defined by the SEC with an investor focus, revolves around its potential to influence investment decisions or critical shareholder votes. In simpler terms, if it's something that would concern the CEO and top executives, it might very well be material. While the determination of materiality doesn't rest solely with technology or cybersecurity leaders, the challenge lies in ensuring that corporate officers and the board of directors comprehend the impact of cybersecurity incidents on financial and business operations.

Furthermore, the impact of third-party incidents on an organization's posture is a crucial consideration. A data breach or ransomware attack on a critical partner may have a material impact on your organization, as highlighted by the frequent mention of ""third party"" in the final rule.

 Implications for Different Entities
It's evident that publicly traded companies must ensure compliance with the SEC's new rule. However, this doesn't absolve non-public companies or entities outside the United States from the need to address these cybersecurity risk management practices. Moreover, it's common for rules like this to become the standard across the board, influencing all companies, regardless of their public or private status.

 Preparing for Compliance
In the absence of a universal playbook, there are several best practices that public companies should consider as they navigate their paths toward compliance:
1. Create a Team: Designate business leaders to establish improved lines of communication with security teams and understand the existing security and risk management programs. This information should be effectively communicated to the board and C-suite. Ideally, a working group comprising cybersecurity leaders and business executives should engage in scenario planning around common cybersecurity incidents.
2. Cybersecurity Expertise on the Board: Despite the rule's removal of this requirement, it's advisable for organizations to incorporate cyber expertise into their boards of directors or seek external experts to advise on roles, responsibilities, and program enhancements.
3. Update the 8-K Process: The 8-K form now necessitates issuers to describe material aspects of cybersecurity incidents, including their nature, scope, timing, and material impact on the registrant's financial condition and results of operations.

As the SEC's new security disclosure rule takes full effect, public companies must proactively prepare to ensure compliance. Establishing a customized playbook with an action plan for the C-suite and security leaders will enable swift and compliant responses to cybersecurity incidents.
