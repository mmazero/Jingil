https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Climate Change Impact: Outdoor Days by 2080"" ","The concept of global warming can be challenging to comprehend, but a new tool developed by researchers at MIT is making it easier to understand how climate change may impact your region. The tool predicts the number of ""outdoor days"" that people in different parts of the world might experience from now until 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked.

California, France, and Germany are among the regions that will see more outdoor days in the future, with the UK experiencing the greatest increase. However, some temperate areas, such as New York and Japan, will lose a week or more of outdoor days. Nigeria and India will experience even more drastic changes, with nearly two months of outdoor days lost due to rising temperatures.

It's not too late to make a change, though. If the world can reach net zero carbon emissions by 2070, the situation will improve dramatically. Nigeria and India will only lose one month of outdoor days, and more northerly regions will retain some of their added outdoor days.

Climate scenario analysis is a branch of strategic planning that seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. It's not a new field, but advances in computational power have fostered more sophisticated climate models, making it more broadly applicable than before.

Several startups are using this newfound predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on investors, lenders, and insurers, providing dashboards and data feeds that help customers assess risk. ClimateAI targets agriculture, while Sensible Weather works on markets closer to home, providing insurance for outdoor events and activities.

As more businesses and consumers become aware of how climate change is affecting their lives, demand for certainty will create new markets for these startups and their peers. Climate scenario analysis is poised to enter the mainstream, and the future of climate prediction is bright.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"Learn how climate change will impact outdoor days in your region with a new tool developed by MIT.

Iron Sheepdog: Simplifying Short-Haul Trucking with Technology

Building something simple can be incredibly challenging, especially in the tech industry. Iron Sheepdog, a Williamsburg, Virginia-based company, is attempting to simplify the short-haul trucking space, which largely involves outsourcing short-haul jobs to truckers booked through brokers. The company's goal is to make the process more seamless and efficient by providing a software solution that allows companies to track their contracted trucks and gives truckers an easy-to-use app for accepting jobs and getting paid online.

Iron Sheepdog has seen significant success in the industry, with its competitors failing to achieve the same level of adoption. The company has doubled in growth each year since its founding and recently raised a $10 million Series B round led by SJF Ventures, with participation from Grand Ventures, Supply Chain Ventures, and strategic partners. Mike Van Sickel, Iron Sheepdog's co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that the company spent its first few years making sure it could get customer adoption and reach profitability before looking to scale.

One of the reasons for Iron Sheepdog's success is its focus on adoption. The company chose to approach the problem from the bottom up, starting with the short-haul truck drivers themselves, rather than relying on contractors to drive adoption. The simple app and the promise of 24-hour pay made it easy for truckers to sign up, which pushed brokers to sign up, and the process continued up the chain. Contractors were also incentivized to sign up, knowing that the platform gave them access to a network of over 4,000 short-haul truckers.

Iron Sheepdog's platform is now being used by a substantial number of brokers and truckers, allowing companies to better utilize them. For example, a company could hire a truck to do two jobs on the same day or drop off material at two sites, reducing the number of trucks needed. This could also help cut emissions.

The focus on adoption is particularly noteworthy as it is often overlooked in the tech industry. Van Sickel notes that tech solutions often fail to gain traction if they are not embraced by the individuals who will use them. The crawl, walk, run approach is crucial in ensuring that tech solutions are successful.

Innovation around trucking has been largely overlooked, with a focus on autonomous construction vehicles and last-mile freight. However, Iron Sheepdog is one of the few, if not the only, venture-backed startups tackling this problem. Its focus on adoption, simplicity, and ease of use make it stand out in the short-haul trucking industry.

In conclusion, Iron Sheepdog's success in simplifying the short-haul trucking space demonstrates the importance of a bottom-up approach and adoption in the tech industry. Its platform has made the process more seamless and efficient, and its focus on ease of use and adoption has set it apart from its competitors. As the company continues to scale and gain traction in the industry, it is poised to revolutionize the short-haul trucking space.

The cybersecurity industry is facing a severe shortage of talent, with an estimated 4 million person workforce gap. This shortage is only expected to worsen as the industry continues to grow. However, generative AI has the potential to address this issue and provide a positive impact on cybersecurity.
Through the use of generative AI, we can lower the bar to entry in the cybersecurity industry. By simplifying technical documentation and providing more user-friendly information, we can make it easier for new hires to understand the concepts and tools required to succeed. This can also help reduce the time and resources required to train new employees.
Gen AI can also be used to reduce the risk of burnout for security professionals. By automating repetitive tasks such as searching for documentation and logging processes, we can free up valuable time and energy for more critical activities such as remediation and risk reduction.
Another area where generative AI can be particularly useful is in continual education. AI can be used to gather and distill information from trusted sources, allowing security professionals to stay up-to-date on the latest threats, attack vectors, and best practices. This can help improve cross-team organizational security communications and reduce the risk of security breaches.
However, it's important to carefully consider how generative AI is used and put proper policies and safeguards in place. For example, organizations should establish a paid, contractual relationship with their AI platform vendor to ensure guidance and troubleshooting support. This can help prevent security teams from using AI tools without proper oversight or control.
In conclusion, generative AI has the potential to address the skill shortage and provide a positive impact on cybersecurity. By using AI to lower the bar to entry, reduce risk of burnout, and improve continual education, we can help ensure that the industry remains strong and resilient in the face of evolving threats.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-giant-unlocked-padlock-letting-out-a-burst-of-li-7KrtL86MSyS_AD7ADE46qw-s-BURFAZT7mJv6iRNfMBbg-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-30 19:15:00,"Incorporating the focus keyphrase and optimizing it for search engines, the meta description for the news article is:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/this-week-in-ai-let-us-not-forget-the-humble-data-annotator/,This Week in AI: Let us not forget the humble data annotator, Improving AI Efficiency through Ethical Labeling ,"Welcome to this week's AI news roundup! We've got a lot to cover, so let's dive right in.

In the world of machine learning, labeling and annotation startups are playing an increasingly important role. These platforms, like Scale AI, which is reportedly in talks to raise new funds at a $13 billion valuation, are essential for the development of modern AI models. The data that these models train on must be labeled, with tags or markings that help the models understand and interpret the data during the training process.

The accuracy and quality of labels are critical to the performance and reliability of the trained models. Annotation is a vast undertaking, requiring thousands to millions of labels for more sophisticated data sets. Despite the importance of these startups, many of them foster brutal working conditions for their annotators, who are often paid low wages and denied basic benefits and protections.

One such example is Scale AI, which recruits annotators in countries such as Nairobi and Kenya. Some of the tasks on Scale AI require labelers to work multiple eight-hour workdays with no breaks, and pay as little as $10. These workers are also often exposed to disturbing content, such as graphic imagery, without access to mental health resources.

An excellent piece in NY Mag sheds light on Scale AI's practices, as well as the broader issue of ethical labeling work in the industry. There are currently no regulations or industry standards for what ethical labeling work entails, and companies' own definitions of ethical labeling can vary widely.

Barring significant technological breakthroughs, the need for annotated and labeled data for AI training is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. Policymaking may be the best solution to address the ethical issues surrounding these startups. However, policymaking can be a tricky prospect, given the complexities of the issue and the lack of consensus among stakeholders.

In other AI news, researchers have made significant strides in weather forecasting. MetNet-3 and GraphCast have developed a new system called SEEDS, which uses diffusion to generate ensembles of plausible weather outcomes based on input data. This allows for faster and more accurate forecasting, even in edge cases where other models may struggle.

Fujitsu has also announced plans to improve its understanding of the natural world by applying AI image handling techniques to underwater imagery and lidar data collected by underwater autonomous vehicles. This will help create a digital twin of waters that can simulate and predict new developments.

Finally, researchers have discovered that linear functions are an unexpectedly simple mechanism that allows LLMs to mimic intelligence. This is one instance of the many complex mechanisms that make up these models, even though they are trained on large amounts of data and are difficult to understand.

In conclusion, the world of AI is constantly evolving, with new innovations and challenges emerging every day. Labeling and annotation startups, while often overlooked, are essential for the development of modern AI models. Policymaking may be the best solution to address ethical issues in the industry, but it is a complex and challenging process. Nonetheless, with continued innovation and research, we can continue to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sensetime1.jpg?resize=1200,640",2024-03-30 13:01:25,Enhancing ethical labeling in AI: Improving working conditions and policymaking solutions [Focus Keyphrase: ethical labeling in AI], Ethical labeling AI ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/the-market-is-forcing-cloud-vendors-to-relax-data-egress-fees/,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees," Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Relax Egress Fees for Customers ","The three major cloud providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, have recently relaxed their egress fees, which are essentially taxes charged to customers who want to move their data to another provider. This change is seen as a response to changing market dynamics, increased competition, stricter regulations, and consumer backlash. The companies are realizing that their previous protectionist stance was not beneficial in the long run.

John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research, believes that this change is a natural progression of the market. “As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist,” he says. Dinsdale also notes that giving customers what they want is the right business strategy in today's IT world.

Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, agrees that the shift away from egress fees is partly due to regulatory pressure. However, she also notes that Google has used this change as a marketing tool to paint itself as the “less restrictive” cloud provider and attract early-stage customers.

David Linthicum, a cloud consultant, warns that while the recent announcements are a pleasant PR move, customers should carefully review their bills as egress fees are not the only problem. He advises customers to consider the costs holistically, including networking fees and other hidden fees that may come along with cloud services.

Seseri also notes that larger enterprise customers may not be affected as much as startups, as there are more moving parts in a cloud ecosystem, and the largest companies have built tight infrastructures that can be onerous to unwind. However, she believes that the experience of startups will certainly improve as providers now must lean further into innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty.

Graham, CEO and co-founder of Bobsled, a startup that helps customers move data between clouds, sees his whole business model affected by these fees. He believes that the recent changes are a small but important step, but he also sees a future where it may become increasingly difficult to determine what is an egress fee and what's not, which could lead to the ultimate demise of these fees.

In conclusion, the relaxation of egress fees by the big three cloud vendors is a response to changing market dynamics and increased competition. While this change may not affect startups as much as larger enterprise","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738",2024-03-31 16:00:41,"Cloud Customers: The Shift Away from Egress Fees Could Lead to Improved Customer Satisfaction and Innovation, But Be Careful of Hidden Fees."," cloud customers, the shift away from egress fees could lead to improved customer satisfaction and innovation.
