https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork"," AWS, Google, Oracle back Valkey Redis fork: Lessons learned from open-source dispute. ","THE FORKING OF REDIS: A TALE OF OPEN SOURCE AND LICENSES

Last week, the Linux Foundation announced it would host Valkey, a fork of the renowned in-memory data store, Redis. Valkey's emergence comes after Redis Labs, the company behind Redis, shifted its flagship software from the permissive BSD license to the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL) in March. This shift made offering Redis-as-a-service challenging without entering commercial agreementsâ€”a move deemed incompatible with open source principles.

The Road to Forking

To understand why Redis forked, let us delve into its history. Launched in 2009 by creator Salvatore Sanfilippo, Redis debuted under the BSD license, allowing him to explore potential commercial opportunities while encouraging competition through various branches with differing licensing models. As Redis grew increasingly popular, Garantia emerged as the first significant Redis service provider, subsequently rebranding to RedisDB in 2013. Following objections from Sanfilippo and the broader community, Garantia evolved into Redis Labs, ultimately becoming Redis in 2021.

In 2015, Sanfilippo joined Redis Labs and eventually transferred his intellectual property to Redis Labs/Redis prior to departing in 2020. However, tension escalated in 2018 when Redis altered its module licensing model. Initially using the Apache License accompanied by the Commons Clause, restrictions were imposed on reselling and hosting these modules. Although Redis maintained that the open-source edition remained unaffected under the BSD license, events unfolded differently recently.

Reactions from the Community

Upon announcing the switch to SSPL, Redis Labs CEO Rowan Trollope stated that such action might encourage major cloud service providers to support competing alternatives. Indeed, several prominent players, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, endorsed Valkey, with the exception of Microsoft.

Madelyn Olson, former Redis maintainer and initial leader of the Valkey project, shared insights about the decision to part ways. According to Olson, when Redis opted for the SSPL, contributors hesitated to collaborate further due to the limitations imposed. Consequently, members flocked to join Valkey instead, forming a formidable team committed to preserving the spirit of innovation associated with Redis. Despite tensions, Redis representatives expressed willingness to negotiate terms and welcomed constructive dialogue aimed at fostering unity and progression.

Lessons Learned

Valkey's emergence serves as a reminder of the intricate dynamics surrounding open-source projects and their governance structures. While flexibility and adaptability characterize successful ventures, alterations can lead to fragmentation and disillusionment amongst stakeholders. Balancing corporate objectives and maintaining harmony within communities remains crucial to ensuring growth and longevity across open-source initiatives.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"Discover the story behind Valkey, a Redis fork born out of licensing changes and community dissatisfaction.

In recent times, the three titans of the cloud computing world - Amazon, Microsoft, and Google - have reconsidered their egress fees. These fees, akin to a tax, are charged to customers for moving their data to another cloud vendor. This adjustment in policy reflects a growing realization of evolving market dynamics and the importance of fostering customer goodwill.

This change of heart signifies the emergence of a multi-cloud world and the need to reduce friction when moving data. John Dinsdale, chief analyst, and managing director at Synergy Research, explains, ""As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist."" The cloud providers have acknowledged the need to give customers what they want, as legacy companies that cling to old ways have struggled in the rapidly changing IT world.

Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder of Bobsled, a startup that assists customers in moving data between clouds, has witnessed the consequences of these fees firsthand. ""They're starting to get significant pushback from their enterprise customers, who are saying that there is no world in which a global enterprise is not using multiple platforms,"" Graham said.

Regulatory pressure has also played a role in this shift, as Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, points out. However, she believes that the cloud providers aim to attract early-stage customers by positioning themselves as less restrictive. She also notes, ""Cloud customers looking to switch providers will need to be retained through innovative and accessible features now that the punishment of egress fees is being phased out.""

David Linthicum, a seasoned cloud consultant, while welcoming this change, cautions customers to examine their bills carefully. ""Customers have to consider the costs holistically...What are we paying for the services we're leveraging? What are we paying for the networking fees, the egress fees, all the other hidden fees that come along with what people call junk fees that come from the cloud vendors?""

Startups may not feel the impact of these changes as much as larger enterprise customers. However, the overall customer experience will improve, as cloud providers will need to focus on innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-2d-perovskite-oxide-photoactive-high.html,Using a 2D perovskite oxide as a photoactive high-Îº gate dielectric,2D Perovskite Oxide as High-Îº Gate Dielectric for Optoelectronics,"

Two-dimensional (2D) superconducting materials have shown promise in the development of miniaturized optoelectronic devices. However, these smaller devices require higher gate capacitance, which means gates that can store more electrical charge in proportion to the voltage applied. One way to achieve this without reducing the thickness of gate insulators or gate dielectrics is to use high dielectric constant (Îº) materials, such as hafnium oxide (HfO 2 ). However, these materials have proven difficult to integrate with 2D semiconductors.

Researchers at Fudan University have recently developed a 2D perovskite oxide with high-Îº that can be integrated with different 2D channel materials. Their paper, published in Nature Electronics, could open up new opportunities for the future down-scaling of optoelectronics.

""High dielectric constant (high-Îº) gate dielectrics compatible with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are essential for scaled optoelectronic devices,"" said Siyuan Li, Xinya Liu, and their collaborators. ""However, conventional three-dimensional dielectrics are difficult to integrate with 2D materials with dangling-bond-free surfaces. We show that the 2D perovskite oxide Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , prepared by a top-down approach, can be integrated with various 2D channel materials.""

The 2D perovskite oxide Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 was synthesized using a top-down preparation strategy. After preparing SNO nanosheets, they were transferred onto various 2D materials. The researchers then tested the performance of transistors integrating these materials with Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 .

Molybdenum disulfide transistors exhibited an on/off ratio of 106 with a supply voltage of 2 V and a subthreshold swing of 88 mV decâˆ’1. Tungsten disulfide phototransistors exhibited a photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio of ~106 and ultraviolet (UV) responsivity of 5.5 Ã— 103 A Wâˆ’1 under visible or UV light illumination, due to the combined effect of gate control and charge transfer from the photoactive gate dielectric.

The initial findings gathered by this team of researchers were highly promising, as they could successfully integrate their perovskite oxide with various channel materials following a simple procedure. Moreover, the well-defined interface established between the semiconductor and dielectric, along with the high-Îº of Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , were found to enable the efficient gate control of channel materials.

The researchers also show that the phototransistors with the photoactive dielectric can offer UV-visible dual-band photodetection, where UV and visible light illumination are distinguished at separate terminals.

This recent work by Li, Liu, and their collaborators could pave the way for the synthesis of additional 2D perovskite oxides that can be integrated with existing semiconductors and channel materials. Collectively, these 2D perovskite oxides could be used to develop smaller, better performing, and energy-efficient electronics or optoelectronics.

In conclusion, the development of high dielectric constant (high-Îº) gate dielectrics that can be integrated with 2D semiconductors is essential for the future down-scaling of optoelectronics. The 2D perovskite oxide Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10, prepared by a top-down approach, has shown promising results in integrating with various 2D channel materials. Further research on this topic could lead to the development of smaller, better performing, and energy-efficient electronics and optoelectronics.

GGV Capital Splits into Two New Brands: Granite Asia and Notable Capital
","GGV Capital, the 24-year-old cross-border venture capital firm, has recently announced that it will split its U.S. and Asia operations into two new brands. The firm's founders, Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo, have rebranded their Singapore-based operation as Granite Asia, while Hans Tung, a co-founder who resides in the Bay Area, has named the U.S. team Notable Capital.

The decision to abandon the GGV Capital brand was made because both teams will be operating independently going forward. According to a source familiar with the decision, the thinking was that it was best to develop new brands.

Granite Asia, led by Lee and Foo, will focus on startups in China, Japan, South Asia, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Lee is a regular fixture on Forbes's Midas List of top-performing venture capitalists, with nine IPOs in the last five years, including Xiaomi and Kingsoft WPS, which went public in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Foo, formerly the global managing director of GGV Capital, is credited with deals that include Xpeng Motors, Didi, and Grab.

Notable Capital, which says it plans to continue investing in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, is being led by the same investors who have been based in its Menlo Park office for many years. Tung, a Taiwanese-American investor, will continue to lead the team, with deals that include Airbnb, StockX, and Slack. The team will also include Jeff Richards, Glenn Solomon, Oren Yunger, and Eric Xu.

Another longtime managing director at GGV Capital, Eric Xu, will continue to oversee the original firm's independently operated yuan-denominated funds. The investors have split their assets under management, with Granite Asia now managing a collective $5 billion altogether, and Notable Capital with roughly $4.2 billion based on GGV Capital's assets under management at the time of the split announcement.

In conclusion, the split of GGV Capital's U.S. and Asia operations into two new brands, Granite Asia and Notable Capital, represents a strategic move by the firm's founders.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/linkedin-is-testing-a-tiktok-like-feed-for-short-form-videos/,LinkedIn is testing a TikTok-like feed for short-form videos, LinkedIn Tests Short-Form Videos on Platform ,"LinkedIn, the professional networking platform, is increasingly becoming a hub for entertainment and distraction. Just a few weeks ago, the company announced that games would be coming to the site, complete with leaderboards that let you compete against other companies' employees. Now, LinkedIn is reportedly testing short-form videos on the platform, similar to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook and Instagram Reels.

LinkedIn users have been posting videos on the platform for years, but the new feature focuses on short videos that you can quickly scroll through. The company killed its ephemeral video feature, Stories, in August 2021, and is now moving towards a ""reimagined video experience that's even richer and more conversational.""

Despite the sparsity of details, we know that the new feature will be housed in a new Video tab at the top of the navigation bar. Clicking on that tab will open a video that you can like, comment on, or share. LinkedIn hasn't officially announced the feature yet, so there's no word as to when we can expect a wider rollout.

It's worth noting that LinkedIn has faced criticism in the past for being too focused on entertainment and distraction, rather than on helping users find work or do actual work. It remains to be seen whether short-form videos will be a welcome addition to the platform, or whether they will simply add to the noise and distraction.

Overall, LinkedIn's new short-form video feature is an interesting development that could potentially make it easier for users to find and consume content on the platform. However, it's important for LinkedIn to continue focusing on its core mission of helping people find work and succeed in their careers, rather than getting lost in the distractions of entertainment.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9a779fa5377ff276b245770deaa45c448d3e963d/2024/04/01/8160075a-0736-421b-9cdc-70c6753c00ea/linkedin-video-screensot.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"""Discover LinkedIn's new short-form video feature!

https://www.zdnet.com/article/instagrams-blend-feature-would-privately-share-reels-between-you-and-a-friend/,Instagram's Blend feature would privately share Reels between you and a friend,Title: Instagram Tests Private 'Blend' Feature for Shared Reels Collaboration,"Title: Exclusive Look at Instagram's New Feature: 'Blend'

Introduction

In its continuous pursuit of innovation, Instagram is reportedly working on a new feature called 'Blend.' This unique addition allows users to create a personalized collection of Reels with a friend, fostering collaboration and enhancing the overall experience. Although still in its early stages, Blend has the potential to revolutionize the way users interact with one another and consume content on the popular social media platform. In this article, we will delve deeper into what we know about Blend so far, along with discussing some existing features that contribute to Instagram's success.

What is Blend?

According to mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, Blend functions as a curated, exclusive space where users can gather Reels they have previously shared with others or those they both find interesting. As a private feed between two individuals, either party can opt-out whenever they wish. While Blend remains an internal prototype, Instagram confirmed to TechCrunch that there are currently no plans for external testing. Nonetheless, the concept alone hints at exciting possibilities for future collaborations among users.

Understanding Reels

Before diving further into Blend, let us first explore the foundation upon which this innovative feature builds â€“ Reels. These brief, entertaining videos offer users the opportunity to showcase their creativity through various tools such as recording, adding music tracks, and incorporating visual effects. Both private and public accounts benefit from these features, enabling them to distribute Reels exclusively to their followers or broadcast them globally. Accessing Reels involves tapping the designated icon found in the Instagram application or visiting the webpage. Users can then swipe vertically to navigate through individual entries. Interactive options include liking, commenting, reposting, or listening to the audio attached to each clip.

How Does Instagram Curate Content for Its Users?

One intriguing aspect of Instagram lies in its ability to present tailored content recommendations for its vast user base. By examining factors such as followed profiles, viewed Reels, preferred genres, and interaction history, the algorithm intelligently predicts material likely to pique the viewer's interests. Moreover, actions including resharing, finishing a Reel, or exploring related pages signal additional preferences guiding subsequent suggestions.

The Impact of Collaborative Features on User Engagement

Introducing features that facilitate cooperation amongst users could significantly impact user engagement and satisfaction. Allowing multiple parties to collectively compile and appreciate Reels brings forth a sense of camaraderie while simultaneously broadening exposure opportunities for creators. Furthermore, such innovations help solidify Instagram's competitive stance against rival platforms such as TikTok, encouraging healthy competition in the ever-evolving landscape of online multimedia sharing applications.

Conclusion

Though details regarding Instagram's latest venture remain limited, the prospective launch of 'Blend' carries considerable implications for the platform's growth trajectory. Through enhanced interpersonal connections and customizable content consumption experiences, Blend demonstrates yet another testament to Instagram's commitment to evolve and cater to its diverse community. Only time will tell if this promising feature successfully transitions from conception to reality; however, anticipation continues to build around the myriad ways Blend could enrich the Instagram ecosystem.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ed01bc04cbe8aa997a1cd9a943aa351c630abcc0/2024/04/01/dd63674f-b994-49ca-ae7f-07d5341e17ed/figure-top-instagram-blend-privately-share-reels.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Discover Instagram's Innovative 'Blend' Feature: A Personalized Space for You & a Friend
