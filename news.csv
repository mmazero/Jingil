In the realm of cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications have gained prominence, yet their development remains a complex endeavor. Initia, a startup founded by a group of young developers, aims to simplify the process of creating app-specific blockchains and enhance interoperability across multichain networks.

The blockchain landscape is fragmented, with popular networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin dominating the scene. However, app chains have emerged, providing developers with greater customization freedom in aspects such as governance and economic structures. This fragmentation poses challenges for users, who encounter varying gas fees, wallets, and explorers, leading to a disjointed experience.

Initia's co-founder, Ezaan Mangalji, highlights the complexities faced by users when dealing with different versions of the same asset across multiple blockchains. For instance, the stablecoin USDC may have multiple versions on the same chain, complicating asset management. Initia aims to address this fragmentation by ensuring fungibility across multichain networks, presenting a unified view of assets across thousands of app-specific blockchains.

In the age of smartphones and instant gratification, Lapse, a unique photo-sharing app, is taking us back to the nostalgic charm of analog cameras. With Lapse, you can capture moments without the pressure of editing or retaking shots, offering a refreshing alternative to the curated perfection of social media.

Lapse has gained significant traction, boasting millions of users, 100 million photos captured monthly, and a consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photography. This recent $30 million funding round, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, propels Lapse towards its ambitious goal of revolutionizing photo-sharing.

The app's ethos is rooted in simplicity and authenticity. It eliminates the endless cycle of editing and retakes, encouraging users to embrace the spontaneity and imperfections of the moment. Behind the scenes, Lapse employs sophisticated algorithms to enhance the photos, optimizing composition and subject matter without compromising the unedited aesthetic.

However, Lapse has faced criticism for its initial growth strategies, which involved forced invites and aggressive marketing tactics. While these methods may have boosted downloads, they raised concerns about sustainability and user experience. The company has since shifted its focus towards organic growth and building a critical mass of users who genuinely appreciate the app's unique approach.

Lapse's resurgence aligns with a growing trend among consumers who are weary of the data-hungry, attention-grabbing nature of mainstream social media platforms. There's a longing for simpler, more authentic ways to connect with friends and share life's moments without the pressure of perfection.

As Jacob Andreou, a general partner at Greylock, aptly observes, ""There's a hole where there is no place where you can go to just check out your friends' profiles, see what they're up to."" Lapse aims to fill this void by providing a dedicated space for genuine connections and unfiltered sharing.

Whether Lapse can sustain its momentum and capture a significant share of the photo-sharing market remains to be seen. However, its unique approach and the growing demand for authentic social interactions suggest that it has the potential to disrupt the status quo and redefine how we share our lives with friends.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/glean-wants-to-beat-chatgpt-at-its-own-game-in-the-enterprise/,Glean wants to beat ChatGPT at its own game — in the enterprise,"

In the realm of enterprise technology, a new player has emerged, aiming to redefine the way employees access and utilize information within their organizations. Glean, a software platform founded by Arvind Jain, former co-founder of Rubrik, seeks to revolutionize the way employees interact with data, much like ChatGPT has done for the general public.

Inspired by his observations of employees struggling to find the information they needed to perform their jobs effectively, Jain embarked on a mission to create a solution that would bridge the gap between employees and the vast pools of data often locked away in disparate systems. Glean was born out of this need, promising to transform the way employees access and utilize information within their organizations.

Glean's journey began as an AI-powered search app, similar to Microsoft's SharePoint Syntex and Amazon Kendra. However, it has evolved into a platform that seamlessly connects with and analyzes a company's databases and data stores to provide employees with relevant answers to their queries. This evolution mirrors the explosive trend of generative AI (GenAI), which has captured the attention of the tech world.

Glean's capabilities extend beyond simple keyword searches. It ingests information from various sources, including support tickets, chat messages, and customer relationship management (CRM) platform entries. By leveraging GenAI, Glean transforms this raw data into actionable insights and relevant answers, catering to the specific needs of each employee.

One might question the security and privacy implications of connecting proprietary data to a GenAI platform. Glean addresses these concerns by adhering to strict security measures. It respects the same permissions set in a company's data sources, ensuring that employees only receive answers based on the data they are authorized to access. Additionally, Glean automatically deletes documents from its system when they are deleted in the underlying application, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

A common concern with GenAI platforms is their tendency to hallucinate or generate inaccurate information. Glean acknowledges this challenge and has implemented several measures to mitigate these risks. The platform employs a model trained on customer data to understand industry-specific jargon and firm-specific terminology. It also allows customers to switch among several open-source GenAI models to drive Glean's core experience, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

To further enhance performance, Glean utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that grounds GenAI responses by retrieving data from external knowledge sources. This ensures that every answer provided by Glean is fully referenceable back to the original source, boosting confidence in the accuracy of the information presented.

Glean's business model revolves around a monthly per-seat subscription, based on annual contracts. Despite competition from tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as established enterprise search providers, Glean has experienced remarkable growth, with annual recurring revenue nearly quadrupling in the past year. This success story challenges the notion that corporations are hesitant to adopt GenAI solutions.

Glean's impressive financial performance and growing customer base, which includes notable names like Duolingo, Grammarly, and Sony, have attracted the attention of investors. The company recently secured $200 million in a Series D funding round, co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed Venture Partners. This funding will fuel Glean's expansion plans, including team growth, product enhancements, and the development of a robust go-to-market strategy.

As Glean continues to gain traction in the enterprise software market, it is poised to transform the way employees access and utilize information within their organizations. Its ability to bridge the gap between employees and data, combined with its commitment to security and accuracy, positions Glean as a formidable player in the rapidly evolving world of GenAI.

Title: Unraveling the Complexities of Digital Payments in the Middle East and Africa: MoneyHash's Journey

In the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, the world of digital payments is a tapestry of intricacies, marked by a multitude of payment providers and methods, evolving regulations, and diverse customer preferences. This intricate landscape is further entangled by challenges like payment fraud, low checkout conversion rates, and high transaction failure rates.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating the adoption of digital payments in the region, infrastructure development remains inadequate. Payment failure rates in MEA are three times higher than the global average, while fraud rates and cart abandonment surpass those of other regions by over 20%. This poses a significant hurdle for merchants, who often view payments as a cost and risk factor rather than a strategic asset.

Enter MoneyHash, an Egyptian fintech company that aims to untangle the complexities of digital payments in Africa and the Middle East. Founded in 2020, MoneyHash has recently secured $4.5 million in seed investment to further bolster its technology and expand its reach across the region.

MoneyHash's mission is to streamline payment processes for merchants through a unified payment API. By integrating pay-in and pay-out rails, offering a customizable checkout experience, and providing transaction routing capabilities with fraud and failure rate optimizers, MoneyHash empowers merchants to accept payments seamlessly and efficiently.

Nader Abdelrazik, MoneyHash's co-founder and CEO, highlights the immense growth potential in the MEA region, with only 10% of all payments currently being digital. However, navigating this burgeoning market requires patience and a commitment to continuous learning.

As businesses expand and venture into multiple regions, they often face the challenge of integrating different payment stacks. This process can be time-consuming and complex, often requiring weeks of effort from in-house tech teams. MoneyHash's unified API simplifies this process, enabling merchants to integrate various payment providers quickly and easily.

MoneyHash's collaboration with merchants over the past four years has provided valuable insights into the nuances of digital payments in the MEA region. Abdelrazik emphasizes that payment failure rates vary significantly across businesses, ranging from 1 out of 10 to as high as 5 or 6 out of 10. Additionally, many merchants are unaware of the complexities of payments and the potential solutions available to address these challenges.

MoneyHash's focus on team expertise sets it apart in the competitive fintech landscape. The company hires individuals with extensive backgrounds in payments and technology, even for non-technical roles. This strategic approach ensures that customers can rely on MoneyHash's deep knowledge and expertise in navigating the intricacies of digital payments.

Following a successful Beta launch in 2022, MoneyHash introduced its enterprise suite last October, targeting large enterprises. The company has since tripled its revenue, increased its processing volume by 3,000%, and boasts 50 active paying customers.

MoneyHash's recent seed round, co-led by COTU Ventures and Sukna Ventures, reflects investor confidence in the company's potential to revolutionize digital payments in the MEA region. Amir Farha, general partner at COTU, believes that MoneyHash's platform can unlock new revenue streams for merchants and catalyze the growth of digital payments across the region.

As MoneyHash continues its journey, it is poised to transform the digital payments landscape in the MEA region, empowering merchants to embrace the full potential of digital transactions and unlock new opportunities for growth.

Additionally, Superhuman's auto-summarize feature provides a one-line summary at the top of emails, making it easier to grasp the gist of a message at a glance.

Superhuman's commitment to AI innovation sets it apart from competitors. The company's co-founder and CEO, Rahul Vohra, emphasizes the ""stickiness"" of Superhuman's AI-powered features, noting that users engage with the AI assistant an average of 25 times per week when composing emails.

Superhuman's product roadmap outlines a clear vision for the future of AI-powered email. The company aims to progress from an assistant-based approach to a fully automated one, where AI handles tasks like scheduling and email composition without user intervention.

While Superhuman's pricing has remained consistent at $30 per month since its launch, Vohra hints at a possible price adjustment later this year. The company is also exploring the development of special edition email clients tailored to specific industries, such as sales and customer management.

Superhuman's mission to transform email from a mere productivity tool into a platform for smart collaboration is an ambitious one. By introducing features that foster seamless internal communication and collaboration, Superhuman aims to redefine the way teams communicate and work together.

As the world of email continues to evolve, Superhuman stands at the forefront of innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI-powered email experiences. With its instant replies feature and a roadmap packed with exciting developments, Superhuman is poised to revolutionize the way we communicate and collaborate through email.

Blood Donation and Covid-19 Vaccines: Debunking the Rumors

In the face of an ongoing blood shortage, rumors have surfaced online, claiming that the American Red Cross prohibits blood donation after receiving Covid-19 vaccines. This misinformation poses a serious threat to the nation's blood supply, especially considering the widespread vaccination efforts. However, it's crucial to clarify that these rumors are unfounded.

The American Red Cross has unequivocally stated that individuals who have received Covid-19 vaccines, except in rare circumstances, are eligible to donate blood. This reassurance comes as a sigh of relief, given the critical need for blood donations to save lives.

The confusion appears to stem from the Red Cross's eligibility criteria, which mention a two-week waiting period for those vaccinated with live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the virus, which can pose a risk to immunocompromised individuals. However, the vast majority of Covid-19 vaccines administered in the U.S. are non-replicating, inactivated, or RNA-based, and do not require a waiting period.

It's important to note that live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines are currently not widely available or approved for general use in the U.S. Therefore, the chances of encountering someone who has received such a vaccine and needs to wait before donating blood are extremely slim.

The Red Cross's cautious approach is commendable, as it aims to safeguard the health of both donors and recipients. However, it's essential to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of vaccinated individuals can donate blood without delay.

The Fate of Destiny 2's Final Shape: A Critical Analysis

In the realm of Destiny 2, a recent article by Zuhaad Ali of Destiny Bulletin has sparked discussions among the community. The article claims that pre-orders for The Final Shape, the highly anticipated expansion, are significantly lower compared to previous expansions, raising concerns about the game's future.

However, upon closer examination, the methodology employed in the article raises questions about its accuracy as a reliable metric for gauging the fate of Destiny 2. The analysis primarily relies on data from Charlemagnebot, a playerbase data-hoarding tool, to track the number of players with the emblem associated with Final Shape pre-orders.

The results indicate that the emblem count falls short of Lightfall's alleged pre-orders and significantly lags behind Beyond Light's, which reportedly holds the record for the highest pre-orders. This disparity has led to speculations that The Final Shape's pre-orders are alarmingly low.

However, there are several factors that challenge the validity of this analysis. Firstly, the method of obtaining the pre-order emblem has changed in The Final Shape. Unlike previous expansions, the emblem is claimed from the Rewards kiosk rather than Rahool, and it must be actively claimed to appear in collections. This change may have affected the emblem count, potentially underrepresenting the actual number of pre-orders.

Additionally, historical data suggests that pre-orders often surge closer to the expansion's launch date. Players who intend to purchase the expansion may delay their pre-order until shortly before its release to maximize their access to pre-order rewards. This trend could explain the apparent disparity in pre-order numbers.

Furthermore, the article acknowledges that Bungie reported a million pre-orders for The Witch Queen just weeks before its launch, highlighting the potential for a dramatic increase in pre-orders as the expansion approaches.

While the emblem-based analysis raises concerns, it's essential to consider other factors that may have influenced pre-order numbers. Bungie's recent layoffs and reports of revenue misses, coupled with the perceived disappointment of Lightfall, could have contributed to a decline in pre-orders for The Final Shape.

Moreover, the growing competition in the live service gaming space and the natural aging of Destiny 2 may have also played a role in the observed decline.

In conclusion, while the pre-order numbers for The Final Shape may raise some concerns, it's crucial to approach the analysis with caution. The emblem-based methodology has limitations, and other factors may have impacted pre-order trends. Bungie's track record of successful expansions and the potential for a surge in pre-orders closer to launch should be considered when evaluating the game's future prospects.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-ramps-up-efforts-to-combat-disinformation-ahead-of-crucial-eu-elections/,Meta ramps up efforts to combat disinformation ahead of crucial EU elections,"

In the lead-up to the European Parliament elections, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is ramping up efforts to combat misinformation and manipulation on its platforms.

Meta's head of EU affairs, Marco Pancini, outlined a comprehensive plan that includes establishing an EU-specific Election Operations Center, expanding the network of fact-checking partners, and developing tools to detect and label AI-generated content.

The stakes are high, as the June elections will shape the future of the European Union. Voter manipulation tactics, especially with new technologies like deepfakes, could sway results.

Meta has faced criticism for its handling of election interference since 2016, when Russian trolls used the platform to sow discord in the U.S. presidential race. The company has since invested heavily in safety and security, implementing transparency measures for political ads.

However, experts warn that Meta's plan may not be sufficient. Recent reports show that the company failed to catch coordinated influence campaigns originating from China targeting Americans ahead of the 2022 midterms.

Critics argue that Meta's efforts lack teeth, pointing to the lack of a clear system for authenticating images and videos depicting violent confrontations between groups. Additionally, the expansion of the fact-checking network to cover all 24 official EU languages and the requirement for disclosures for AI-generated content may not be enough to address the flood of misinformation expected during such a crucial vote.

Meta's planned transparency labels for AI content are a step in the right direction, but experts question how the system will reliably identify manipulated media like deepfakes. Currently, no technology can detect AI forgeries with complete accuracy.

Past influence operations have also exploited authentic voices like politicians, journalists, and other people with large followings to amplify divisive narratives. This remains a major vulnerability, as even a few shares by someone with credibility can lend legitimacy to false narratives linked to foreign interference.

With the EU elections fast approaching, Meta is on high alert. However, as deepfake technology advances, the frontlines of information warfare grow more complex. Meta's plan is a step in the right direction, but protecting democracy in the social media era remains a challenging task. Authentic voices with power and influence will continue to be prime targets for manipulation.
