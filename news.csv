The feature is an internal prototype and is not being tested externally. It was first discovered by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi who regularly uncovers social media features in development ahead of their official launch.

According to a screenshot posted by Paluzzi, a Blend would include Reels recommendations based on Reels the two users have shared with each other and their Reels interests. This feature is similar to Spotify's ""Blend"" functionality that allows two people to combine their favorite songs into one shared playlist.

The screenshot shows that Blends would be private between the two users and that they could leave a Blend at any time. Instagram hasn't shared any specifics about the feature, such as whether Blends would continuously update with new recommendations or if they would be updated after a certain amount of time.

If launched, Blend would allow Instagram Reels users to discover new Reels together, which could boost Reels' discovery and watch time. Since people already share Reels via DMs, Instagram would now be using that data to proactively recommend and display Reels that it believes a pair of users would enjoy.

As with any prototype, it's unknown when or if Instagram plans to launch the feature externally. However, if released, Blend would give Instagram Reels users access to a fun and collaborative feature that isn't available on its rival platform, TikTok. Though the two products are quite similar, the introduction of ""Blend"" could give Instagram a slight competitive edge over TikTok, albeit a small one considering TikTok continues to largely dominate the short-form video market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 17:37:41,"Looking for fun and collaborative ways to discover new Instagram Reels?

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-openai-unveils-voice-cloning-tool.html,OpenAI unveils voice-cloning tool,OpenAI unveils voice-cloning tool to combat deep fake misuse.,"

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, the potential for its misuse is becoming increasingly apparent. One of the most concerning areas is the creation of deep fakes that can be used for political propaganda, disinformation, and other nefarious purposes. To address this issue, OpenAI, a leading AI research company, has developed a voice cloning tool that can replicate someone's speech with remarkable accuracy.

However, the company is taking a cautious approach to the release of this tool, recognizing the serious risks it poses. In a blog post, OpenAI outlined the precautions it is taking to ensure the safe and ethical use of its technology.

The voice cloning tool, called ""Voice Engine,"" can generate speech that is nearly indistinguishable from the original speaker based on a just 15-second audio sample. While this technology has numerous applications, such as voice synthesis for video games and virtual assistants, its potential for misuse is significant. This is especially true in an election year, where deep fakes can be used to spread false information and manipulate voters.

To address these concerns, OpenAI is engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, media outlets, entertainment companies, educational institutions, and civil society organizations. The company is seeking feedback to ensure that its technology is used ethically and responsibly.

Despite the risks, OpenAI is not shying away from its responsibility to develop and deploy AI technologies. However, it is taking a measured approach to the release of Voice Engine, recognizing the potential for synthetic voice misuse.

This cautious unveiling comes just a few months after a political consultant working for the long-shot presidential campaign of a Democratic rival to Joe Biden admitted to creating a deepfake robocall impersonating the US leader. The incident caused alarm among experts who fear a deluge of AI-powered deepfake disinformation in the 2024 White House race as well as in other key elections around the globe this year.

To address this issue, OpenAI has implemented a set of safety measures to ensure that Voice Engine is used ethically. These measures include requiring explicit and informed consent from any person whose voice is duplicated using the tool and making it clear to audiences when they are hearing AI-generated speech.

In conclusion, OpenAI is taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to the development and deployment of AI technologies like Voice Engine. While the potential for misuse is significant, the company is committed to ensuring that its technology is used ethically and responsibly.

Introduction:
The world of artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly evolving, and with it, the need for data labeling and annotation. These tasks are crucial for the development of modern AI models, allowing them to understand and interpret data during the training process. This week in AI, we'll delve into the world of labeling and annotation platforms and highlight some of the recent developments and controversies in this field.

Labeling and Annotation Platforms:
Data labeling is the process of tagging data with specific labels or tags to help AI models understand and interpret the information. Annotation, on the other hand, involves a more extensive process of labeling and analyzing data, including identifying and categorizing objects and events in images or videos.

The accuracy and quality of labels are essential for the performance and reliability of AI models. Without proper labeling and annotation, the models will struggle to identify patterns and make accurate predictions. However, annotation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that requires thousands to millions of labels for larger and more sophisticated data sets.

Labeling and annotation platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years, with companies like Scale AI reportedly in talks to raise new funds at a $13 billion valuation. While these platforms are essential for AI development, the working conditions and treatment of data annotators have become a topic of concern.

The Dark Side of Data Annotation:
Many data annotation and labeling startups have been criticized for their labor practices, particularly regarding the treatment of data annotators. Annotators are often paid low wages and denied basic benefits, despite the critical role they play in the development of AI models.

One example of this is the use of annotators in third-world countries who are paid a few dollars per hour and exposed to disturbing content without proper support and resources. Some of these workers have been booted off platforms without warning or reason, leaving them without income and job security.

The Ethics of Labeling and Annotation:
There are no clear regulations or industry standards for ethical labeling and annotation practices. This has led to variations in the definition of ethical work among different companies and platforms. Some annotation and labeling platforms claim to provide fair-trade work, but these definitions and practices are often vague and lack transparency.

In March 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could force ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to divest the app or face a ban in U.S. app stores. While the focus of the debate has been on American data security and speech rights, the potential move also highlights something else: TikTok’s growing focus on e-commerce and its potential impact on small merchants.

Over the past few months, sellers from China, many of whom were looking for an Amazon alternative, have flocked to TikTok to peddle a variety of products to U.S. buyers through the platform’s TikTok Shop feature. However, with the political tension between the U.S. and China, the future of TikTok’s e-commerce business is uncertain.

Sellers from Shenzhen, a Chinese megacity that’s a major hub for Amazon merchants, expressed frustration and helplessness about a potential TikTok ban. One retailer specializing in maternity and baby products told TechCrunch, “The situation is not within our control. It’s just difficult to know how things will develop.”

TikTok Shop officially launched in September 2023 with 200,000 merchants already on board. However, since then, the platform has not provided any updated numbers on how many merchants are currently on the platform, nor how much they sell there, nor how many sell elsewhere (and where else that might be).

Research from Jungle Scout, an Amazon data intelligence provider, provides some idea of TikTok’s e-commerce impact. It found that 20% of Amazon sellers, brands, and businesses have plans to expand to TikTok Shop this year. Before the current political backlash took off, ByteDance reportedly projected that it had the potential to grow its U.S. e-commerce business tenfold to $17.5 billion this year.

TikTok is not the only platform on the list for merchants looking for more channels beyond Amazon to expand their customer bases. Its rise is part of a bigger shift we’ve been seeing around alternative marketplaces like Temu commanding more attention not just from shoppers, but from a Chinese e-commerce exporters and merchants. And Amazon is reportedly taking notice, another sign that alternatives are picking up traction.

TikTok did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

A New Way to Sell and Buy

TikTok has been trying to boost its e-commerce business since the U.S. launch in September 2023. To do this, it has taken a different approach than its competitors. Unlike Temu, known for its seas of cheap, white-labeled products from Chinese factories sold directly to U.S. consumers, TikTok’s strategy has been to onboard and highlight more branded goods, making it a more of a direct competitor to Amazon.

TikTok is also looking to attract sellers with more traditional subsidies. According to reports, to encourage merchants to sell goods at a steep discount during the most recent Black Friday sales period, TikTok doled out subsidies to those merchants to mark down their prices by as much as 50%.

Merchants have been interested in selling on the app simply because TikTok’s short video platform generates massive engagement. According to a survey from Tabcut, a Chinese firm that tracks TikTok Shop performance, nearly 70% of sellers reported an increase in sales year-over-year for the first 11 months of 2023.

This is also borne out by consumer behavior, where products endorsed by influencers continue to gain ground, especially with coveted younger consumers. According to Jungle Scout, nearly 20% of consumers began their search for products on TikTok in the first quarter of 2023, up 44% from a year ago. While 56% of all consumers still preferred to start their product search on Amazon, 40% of the Gen Z demographic preferred TikTok for search instead of Google.

Welcome to our blog post on the latest research in the field of 6G mobile vision services. In this article, we will delve into the work of Professor Jeongho Kwak from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST, who has developed a learning model and resource optimization technology that combines accuracy and efficiency for 6G vision services.

6G mobile vision services are associated with cutting-edge technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and autonomous driving, which are receiving significant attention in modern society. These services enable quick capturing of videos and images, and efficient understanding of their content through deep learning-based models. However, this requires high-performance processors (GPUs) and accurate learning models. Previous technologies treated learning models and computing/networking resources as separate entities, failing to optimize performance and mobile device resource utilization.

To address this issue, Professor Kwak's team focused on simultaneously optimizing learning models and computing/networking resources in real-time. As a result, they proposed a new integrated learning model and computing/networking optimization algorithm, VisionScaling, which is capable of reducing energy consumption by at least 30% while maintaining average accuracy compared to current technologies without compromising on average target accuracy or time delay.

The VisionScaling algorithm developed by Professor Kwak's team adapts to constantly changing mobile environments to maintain optimal performance, even without prior knowledge of future conditions, through the use of 'Online Convex Optimization (OCO),' one of the latest learning techniques. Furthermore, Professor Kwak's team implemented and tested the real-world mobile vision service environment using embedded AI devices and connected edge computing platforms. They confirmed that the developed VisionScaling algorithm saves 30% more energy in mobile devices and improves end-to-end latency by 39% compared to previously used algorithms.

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-has-reportedly-been-blocked-on-all-congress-owned-devices-034946166.html,Microsoft Copilot has reportedly been blocked on all Congress-owned devices, Microsoft Copilot Blocked on Congress-Owned Devices; US Government Takes AI Security Seriously ,"In recent news, the US Congress has prohibited the use of Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot on their government-issued devices. The Office of Cybersecurity deemed the chatbot to be a risk due to the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services. While staffers can still use Copilot on their personal phones and laptops, it will no longer be available on all Windows devices owned by Congress.
This news comes a year after the Congress set strict limits on the use of ChatGPT, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models. Staffers were banned from using the free version of the chatbot on House computers but were allowed to continue using the paid version for research and evaluation due to its tighter privacy controls.
Recently, the White House released rules that federal agencies must follow when it comes to generative AI. These rules aim to ensure that any tool used by agencies does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans. Microsoft has recognized the need for higher security requirements and announced a roadmap of tools and services intended for government use, including an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant. All these tools and services will feature higher levels of security that make them suitable for handling sensitive data.
Szpindor's office will evaluate the government version Copilot when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. However, it is clear that government agencies are taking the threat of AI-related security risks seriously and are taking steps to protect sensitive data.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"Meta Description: Microsoft Copilot banned from Congress-owned devices, but government agencies are taking AI-related security risks seriously.
