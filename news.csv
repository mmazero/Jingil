In our increasingly indoor-oriented lives, we've unwittingly distanced ourselves from the sun's natural embrace. This has brought to light a condition called seasonal affective disorder (SAD), affecting approximately 5% of Americans. While the condition may seem niche, it has shed light on the sun's crucial role in serotonin production and its subsequent impact on our well-being.

Light therapy lamps have emerged as a popular solution, mimicking the sun's effects for those confined to computer screens. However, a new contender has entered the ring: near-infrared (NIR) light therapy. This segment of the light spectrum, nestled between infrared and visible light, has gained traction as a potential alternative to visible light therapy.

At the forefront of this innovation is Seaborough, a Dutch company that showcased intriguing devices at MWC. These compact gadgets aim to replace bulky SAD lamps, with one sitting beside the computer and the other clipping above the display like an external webcam. Both draw power from the USB port, making them effortlessly portable.

While these devices are still in their infancy, they hold immense promise. Seaborough envisions integrating this technology directly into laptops, although third-party accessories seem more feasible in the near term. The company's goal is to make NIR light therapy accessible and convenient for those struggling with SAD.

As someone who has grappled with depression, I'm eager to explore this potential solution. However, anecdotal evidence can be tricky, as the placebo effect can skew results. Nevertheless, research has shown promising outcomes. A study conducted a decade ago revealed that NIR light therapy, specifically at a dose of 6.5 J·cm−2, demonstrated positive effects on well-being and health, including improved mood, reduced drowsiness, and a lower resting heart rate.

It's important to note that these benefits were primarily observed during the winter months, and the impact on circadian rhythm was negligible. More research is undoubtedly needed to fully understand the efficacy of NIR light therapy.

The Curious Case of the Phone's Useless Back Panel

In the realm of smartphones, the back of the device often remains an underutilized canvas. While the front is adorned with vibrant screens and captivating cameras, the rear is typically a monotonous expanse of glass or plastic. But what if we could transform this neglected space into a dynamic and functional element?

Enter the E-Color Shift Technology

Infinix, a Hong Kong-based smartphone manufacturer, has taken a step in this direction with its innovative E-Color Shift technology. This technology introduces a color-changing back panel that can display various designs, patterns, and even animations. It's a fascinating concept that aims to breathe life into the otherwise mundane rear surface of the phone.

How Does It Work?

The E-Color Shift technology utilizes a unique material that responds to electrical fields. By applying different voltages, the electric field within the material changes, causing corresponding color particles to move and display desired colors. This innovative approach allows the phone's back panel to change its appearance at will, without consuming additional power.

A Glimpse at the Prototype

At the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to experience the E-Color Shift technology firsthand. It's important to note that this was a prototype, and the final product may differ in terms of functionality and design.

The prototype I saw required an external battery pack to power the color-changing back panel. However, once activated, the display was impressive. It could showcase static images, animations, and even respond to touch input.

Practicality and Potential

While the E-Color Shift technology is undoubtedly captivating, its practicality remains a question mark. The back panel is likely to be covered by a case or obscured by the user's hand most of the time. Additionally, the technology's impact on battery life and overall device thickness needs to be carefully considered.

A Glimpse into the Future

Despite these potential drawbacks, the E-Color Shift technology represents an exciting glimpse into the future of smartphone design. It's a testament to the industry's relentless pursuit of innovation and the desire to create devices that are not only functional but also visually captivating.

Whether this technology will find its way into consumer devices remains to be seen. However, it's a reminder that the smartphone, as we know it, is constantly evolving, and there's always room for groundbreaking ideas to reshape our mobile experience.

North American VCs' European Misadventures: A Struggle for Foothold

In the not-so-distant past, setting up shop in Europe was the golden ticket for North American venture capitalists (VCs). From OMERs and Lightspeed to Bessemer Venture Partners, firms of all sizes flocked to the region, lured by the potential for outsized exits. The Spotify IPO served as a wake-up call, prompting VCs to ensure they didn't miss out on the next wave of European tech success stories.

However, the tides have shifted, and it's unclear whether North American VCs have managed to catch the wave they were chasing. While trends haven't entirely reversed since the boom days of 2021, they've come pretty close.

The European startup market has undoubtedly grown rapidly over the past decade, with deal volume more than doubling, according to PitchBook data. Success stories like Klarna, Deliveroo, and Arrival have further fueled the allure. Understandably, North American VCs want a piece of this pie, but establishing a successful long-term strategy in the region has proven to be a formidable challenge.

In recent months, prominent names like Coatue and OMERs have pulled out of Europe, and those that remain are significantly less active. Data reveals a stark decline in European deals involving U.S. investors, both in terms of value and count.

The European startup market presents unique nuances that pose challenges for North American investors. Each country has its own language and, in some cases, currency. Investing in Romania and Italy, for instance, is vastly different from investing in Texas and California. Moreover, the networks for European startups differ from those in the U.S., influenced by local universities and ecosystems.

These complexities create a challenging landscape, even in the best of times. The economic downturn of the past few years has further exacerbated the situation, making it no wonder that North American investors have struggled to find solid footing in Europe.

Another factor contributing to their difficulties is the growing strength of the European VC market itself. As North American interest has increased, so has local competition, particularly in the early stages where prices are lowest and potential returns are highest.

European startups are no longer solely reliant on U.S. funding. Local players now account for 80% of the capital deployed in Europe. Unless a startup plans immediate expansion into the U.S., it makes more sense to partner with a local investor familiar with the nuances of the European market.

Compounding the challenges, many North American VCs have set up shop in London, which is no longer part of the European Union and represents just one of the region's startup hubs. This focus on London limits their visibility and access to opportunities elsewhere in Europe.

Despite these obstacles, some North American firms remain determined to establish a presence in Europe. General Catalyst's recent merger with La Famiglia, a Berlin-based seed-stage firm, exemplifies this commitment. This partnership aims to enhance General Catalyst's ability to invest in early-stage opportunities across mainland Europe.

Regulatory clarity is another factor driving North American interest in Europe. Hot sectors like AI and crypto face regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., making it difficult for startups to build and investors to assess compliance. While Europe's regulations may not be perfect, they offer more clarity, attracting investors looking for stability.

Limited Partners (LPs) have also shown increasing interest in European startups. The success of companies like Spotify has piqued their curiosity, and as markets like China become less attractive, Europe's reliability as a creator of successful outcomes is gaining traction.

Despite the challenges, the European ecosystem remains largely underpenetrated, presenting opportunities for international VCs willing to adapt and develop effective strategies. The key lies in understanding the nuances of the market, building strong local networks, and focusing on sectors with clear regulatory frameworks.

Kak's work has extended beyond research and policy advocacy. As a senior advisor to the Federal Trade Commission, she played a crucial role in shaping enforcement actions related to emerging technologies. She emphasizes the importance of having diverse perspectives in policymaking, as even a single voice can make a significant difference in influencing outcomes.

Navigating the male-dominated tech industry has not been without its challenges. Kak acknowledges the overwhelming presence of white males in AI, concentrated in wealthy urban bubbles. However, she cautions against focusing solely on diversity as a quick fix. Instead, she emphasizes the need to address the structural inequalities and power imbalances embedded in the tech industry's operations.

Kak believes that exposing the power dynamics concealed by the tech industry is key to creating a more equitable and responsible AI landscape. She advocates for examining the incentives, infrastructures, and labor markets that shape the direction of technology. By doing so, she aims to create counter-narratives and alternative imaginations for the appropriate role of technology in society.

For women and other marginalized identities seeking to enter the AI field, Kak offers valuable advice. She encourages them to stand their ground, recognizing that the industry often attempts to discredit critique, especially from those outside traditional STEM backgrounds. She emphasizes the importance of claiming expertise and authority on matters of technology, as the future of AI will impact everyone, not just those within the industry.

Kak's unwavering commitment to shaping the future of AI, her dedication to addressing the societal and ethical implications of the technology, and her advocacy for diverse perspectives make her an inspiring figure in the field. Her work serves as a reminder that the trajectory of AI is not predetermined and that we all have a role to play in ensuring it serves the public interest.
