Introduction

Imagine a world where renewable energy is harnessed from the most unexpected places - like where salty ocean water meets fresh river water. This is the promising realm of osmotic energy, a form of ""blue"" energy with the potential to contribute significantly to global sustainability efforts. Researchers have been exploring this concept for years, and recent breakthroughs have brought us one step closer to realizing this dream. A team of scientists has developed a game-changing semipermeable membrane that significantly increases the amount of osmotic energy harvested from salt gradients and converts it into electricity.

The Power of Estuaries

Estuaries, the fascinating transitional zones where freshwater rivers meet the salty sea, are not only hotspots for birdwatching and kayaking but also hold immense potential for generating osmotic energy. These areas are characterized by salt gradients, which can serve as a source of sustainable energy. While osmotic energy can be found anywhere salt gradients are present, the technologies to capture this renewable energy source have yet to reach their full potential.

A New Era of Osmotic Energy Harvesting

A team of researchers reported the development of a semipermeable membrane capable of generating osmotic energy from salt gradients and converting it to electricity. This novel design demonstrated an output power density more than two times higher than that of commercial membranes in lab demonstrations.

The Power of Decoupling

The researchers' RED (reverse electrodialysis) membrane prototype featured separate channels for ion transport and electron transport. This was achieved by sandwiching a negatively charged cellulose hydrogel (for ion transport) between layers of an organic, electrically conductive polymer called polyaniline (for electron transport).

The decoupled transport channels resulted in higher ion conductivity and lower resistivity compared to homogenous membranes made from the same materials. In a water tank simulating an estuary environment, their prototype achieved an output power density 2.34 times higher than a commercial RED membrane and maintained performance during 16 days of non-stop operation, demonstrating its long-term, stable performance underwater.

Scientists at Argonne National Laboratory have made a groundbreaking advancement in the field of X-ray microscopy. They've developed a new method that combines machine learning with X-ray microscopy techniques, enabling real-time data analysis and significantly reducing data collection. This innovative approach, called streaming ptychography, has the potential to revolutionize the way scientists conduct experiments and analyze data in various fields.

Traditionally, X-ray microscopes generate vast amounts of data, which can be overwhelming for scientists to process efficiently, even with the aid of large supercomputers. To tackle this challenge, the researchers turned to machine learning, specifically a neural network, to analyze data on the fly. This new process allows for a substantial reduction in data collection, with a more than 100-fold increase in data processing speed and a 25-fold reduction in data collected.

Mathew Cherukara, an Argonne computational scientist and study author, explains the issue: ""Conventional means of analysis can't keep up with data rates...we don't have a means of analyzing all the data that [these amazingly complex, extraordinary pieces of hardware] can produce."" The new neural network, however, enables scientists to run experiments quickly and adapt conditions spontaneously, making ""split-second choices"" about sample analysis.

The ability to analyze data in real time has several important implications. Scientists would no longer need to wait for lengthy data analysis, allowing them to conduct more and better experiments at the APS. Moreover, they could make adjustments to experiments based on the real-time data analysis, leading to more precise and accurate results.

Tao Zhou, an Argonne physicist and study author, elaborates: ""This technique essentially allows people to do the analysis in real time on the beamline, so if they see something new and interesting in the sample that they don't anticipate, they can be ready and able to adapt almost immediately.""

Streaming ptychography functions like a video-streaming app, such as Netflix, but with the unique capability to make adjustments to the experiment itself as scientists react to the data being generated. This allows for on-the-fly adjustments, reducing the need to send data back to a cloud",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/scientists-pioneer-new.jpg,2024-04-24 12:54:13,"Revolutionize X-ray microscopy with real-time data analysis.

Introduction

In the realm of electrical components, capacitors play a crucial role in storing and releasing energy with remarkable speed. These workhorses are essential in various applications, including pacemakers, defibrillators, radar technology, and electric vehicles. Researchers at the University of Twente have recently developed a groundbreaking design strategy to amplify the energy storage capacity, efficiency, and durability of capacitors in the BZT/BST multilayer system (Minh D. Nguyen et al., 2024). This article delves into the fascinating world of capacitors and explores the innovative design that promises to revolutionize their performance.

The Importance of Capacitors in Modern Technology

Capacitors are indispensable in modern technology due to their ability to store and release electrical energy rapidly. In pacemakers, for instance, capacitors charge and discharge in a matter of microseconds to deliver electric pulses that regulate heartbeats. To meet the demands of these critical applications, capacitors must possess high energy storage, efficiency, and durability.

The Challenge: Improving Capacitor Performance

Designing capacitors with improved energy storage, efficiency, and durability is a challenging task. According to Minh Duc Nguyen, a researcher involved in the study, ""Capacitors need to keep up with your heartbeat, so they should be able to charge and discharge up to billions of times. Otherwise, you'll have to replace the pacemaker every few months"" (University of Twente, 2024). To tackle this challenge, Nguyen and his team developed a novel design strategy for multilayer capacitors.

The Innovation: A New Design Strategy for Multilayer Capacitors

The researchers focused on a type of capacitor that utilizes multiple thin layers of different materials. By adding layers, they achieved an impressive efficiency of over 90%, meaning that the capacitor loses less than 10% of the electric charge used for charging.

Fintech startups are paving the way for open banking worldwide, and they may become attractive targets for acquisitions by major players like Visa. One such startup is Fintoc, a Chile-based B2B fintech firm that recently raised $7 million in a Series A round to strengthen its presence in Chile and Mexico.

Fintoc's Innovative Solution

Fintoc offers an API enabling online businesses to accept instant payments directly from customers' bank accounts. This method, known as accounts to accounts (A2A), provides an alternative to credit card transactions with fewer intermediaries. A2A payments can be as seamless as online credit card payments for end-users, who can simply select their bank and securely authenticate their bank credentials instead of entering card details. However, the primary advantage is for businesses, which benefit from lower commissions compared to typical credit card transaction fees.

Open Banking Landscape

As A2A payments gain traction, open banking companies such as Plaid, Tink (owned by Visa), TrueLayer, and Volt have experienced tailwinds. Adyen and Stripe, more generalist fintech players, have also formed partnerships to offer A2A payments to their customers.

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), systems are typically designed to maintain consistent performance or even improve over time. However, a team of researchers from the University of California, Irvine decided to explore a different avenue. Inspired by neurodegeneration in humans, they aimed to emulate cognitive decline in AI agents to enhance interpretability, security, and our understanding of complex systems.

The research team, comprised of Yu-Dai Tsai, Antonios Alexos, and Pierre Baldi, took inspiration from their personal lives and a wide-ranging dinner conversation. The study, published on arXiv, focused on introducing 'neural erosion' to AI agents, specifically large language models (LLMs) like the LLaMA 2. Neural erosion involves ablating synapses or neurons or adding Gaussian noise during or after training, resulting in a controlled decline in the LLMs' performance.

To explore this concept, the researchers used IQ tests performed by LLMs to analyze the effects of neural erosion. They deliberately ablated artificial synapses or neurons of the LLaMA 2 model, observing a particular pattern in its performance decline. This decline mirrors the pattern seen in human neurodegeneration, with AI systems first losing abstract thinking abilities, then mathematical skills, and finally linguistic capabilities.

The potential implications of this study extend beyond reproducing human neurodegeneration. Future research could leverage the observed AI neuro-erosion patterns to tackle real-world problems. Tsai and his collaborators plan to develop their study into specific tests of AI systems, extend the emulation to other neural diseases and neurodiversity, and apply their methods to improve AI security and interpretability.

The primary focus of this research is not to replicate human brain diseases but to understand the functioning of complex AI systems and the capabilities that are first and last to decline when their underlying structure is compromised. By exploring new frontiers in AI studies, the team aims to pave the way for innovative AI systems that utilize artificial neurodegeneration to perform specific tasks.

Dr. Max Donelan, a Professor in Simon Fraser University's Department of Biomedical Physiology and Kinesiology, explains, ""We have no robots capable of anything like this endurance, agility, and robustness."" To explore the reasons behind this gap, a team of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers from leading research universities conducted an in-depth analysis of various aspects of running robots and compared them to animals in a study published in Science Robotics.

The researchers, including Drs. Sam Burden, Tom Libby, Kaushik Jayaram, and Simon Sponberg, examined five different ""subsystems"" that make up a running robot—Power, Frame, Actuation, Sensing, and Control—and compared them to their biological equivalents. Surprisingly, engineering subsystems generally outperformed their biological counterparts, sometimes significantly. However, when considering the whole system level movement, animals demonstrate remarkable efficiency, agility, and robustness, while robots still lag behind.

The study highlights the rapid progress of robotics technology, especially when compared to the countless generations of animals that have evolved over millions of years. Dr. Sam Burden shares an optimistic perspective, ""Whereas we can very much correct how we design robots and learn something in one robot and download it into every other robot, biology doesn't have that option. So there are ways that we can move much more quickly when we engineer robots than we can through evolution.""

Effective running robots hold tremendous potential for various applications, such as solving 'last mile' delivery challenges, exploring dangerous environments, and handling hazardous materials. To advance the field, the researchers suggest directing future development efforts towards integration and control principles rather than solely focusing on improving hardware components.

In conclusion, integrating and controlling existing hardware to mimic animal agility and resilience will propel robotics technology to new heights.

This title captures the essence of the news article while focusing on the key challenge and opportunity: harnessing the power of offshore wind farms in the U.S., particularly addressing the 'wake effect' and its impact on energy production. This title is also under 50 characters, making it suitable for SEO optimization.","Title: Harnessing the Power of Offshore Wind: Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Opportunities

As summer approaches and electricity demand surges in the U.S., many East Coast cities look to offshore wind projects in the Atlantic Ocean to meet the increasing need. However, predicting the amount of wind power these offshore turbines can generate is a complex task. A team of researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder, led by doctoral student Dave Rosencrans and Professor Julie K. Lundquist, is working to tackle this challenge.

The 'wake effect' and its impact on offshore wind turbines

When wind passes through turbines, it loses energy, creating slower and more turbulent air behind the turbines. This phenomenon, known as the 'wake effect,' can reduce the power generated by downstream turbines. In a study published in Wind Energy Science, the team estimated that this effect could decrease the power output of offshore wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean region by more than 30%.

However, the study also revealed that these wind farms could still supply approximately 60% of the electricity demand for the New England grid, which covers six states. Accounting for the wake effect is crucial for making accurate predictions about the power output of offshore wind farms and ensuring a reliable energy supply.

Summer demands and the role of offshore wind

During hot summer days, stable airflow over the cool sea surface can cause wakes to persist for longer periods and travel over longer distances, potentially affecting other wind farms. This is particularly concerning, as summer is when electricity demand is at its highest.

Despite these challenges, offshore wind power holds great potential for meeting the country's energy needs. The U.S. aims to install 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, enough to power more than 10 million homes for a year. To achieve this goal, grid operators need precise information about the energy generated by offshore wind turbines, especially during peak demand periods.

A balancing act for grid operators

Renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are variable, making it difficult for grid operators to maintain a perfect balance between supply and demand in real-time. Precise predictions about the energy generated by offshore wind farms are essential for managing this variability and preventing blackouts.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-explores-human-machines-eerie.html,Study explores why human-inspired machines can be perceived as eerie," ""MacDorman Challenges Uncanny Valley Theory in AI Robot Development"" ","As artificial intelligence (AI) and robots become increasingly advanced, they are exhibiting capabilities that resemble those of humans. Some people view these systems as eerie and uncanny, attributing human feelings, experiences, thoughts, and sensations to them. In a recent study, Karl F. MacDorman, associate dean of academic affairs and associate professor at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indiana, aimed to better understand what makes some robots and AI systems feel unnerving.

MacDorman's recent paper, published in Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans, reviews past studies and reports the findings of an experiment testing the ""mind perception"" theory, which proposes that people feel eeriness when exposed to robots that closely resemble humans because they ascribe minds to these robots. The paper challenges the notion that the uncanny valley, the unnerving nature of robots that have human-like qualities, is solely based on the ""mind perception"" theory.

MacDorman's research suggests that past studies backing the ""mind perception"" theory could be flawed. The researcher gathered opposite results, suggesting that individuals who attribute sentience to robots do not necessarily find them eerier due to their human resemblance. The meta-analysis and experiment run by MacDorman suggest that the uncanny valley is not solely based on the ""mind perception"" theory, but rather on other factors such as the physical presence and representation of robots.

MacDorman's studies have significant implications for the development of AI and robotics. As these systems become more advanced and integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to understand what makes them feel unnerving and how to mitigate these feelings. The results of MacDorman's research can guide the design of robots and AI systems that are less likely to evoke feelings of unease and make them more acceptable and appealing to users.

In conclusion, MacDorman's research highlights the importance of understanding the factors that contribute to the uncanny valley and the limitations of the ""mind perception"" theory. The findings of his meta-analysis and experiment challenge the prevailing view that the uncanny valley is solely based on the ""mind perception"" theory. By understanding the underlying factors that contribute to the uncanny valley, we can design more acceptable and appealing robots and AI systems that are less likely to evoke feelings of unease.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/study-explores-why-hum.jpg,2024-04-25 07:40:02,"""Discover the complexities of 'Robot Anxiety' in MacDorman's study.

In the digital age, small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) have become increasingly attractive targets for cybercriminals. Despite this, SMBs often prioritize other enterprise applications over security tools, according to Andy Choi, deputy director of SME Go Digital at Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in Singapore. This is a worrying trend, considering that 30% to 50% of SMBs in Singapore have experienced at least one ransomware attack.

The SME Go Digital program, launched in 2017, aims to help SMBs adopt digital technologies, providing grants for various enterprise applications. However, HR, accounting, and e-commerce applications have among the highest adoption rates, with cybersecurity lagging behind. This lack of priority for cybersecurity tools leaves SMBs vulnerable to attacks, as they often lack the necessary resources and skills to secure their assets.

Kevin Reed, CISO for data security vendor Acronis, emphasized the urgency of understanding the risks associated with digital transformation efforts. Cyber attackers no longer merely breach networks; they steal credentials and hijack data to exploit victims for ransom. Reed also pointed out that while large ransom payments like the recent $22 million UnitedHealth paid to recover its data often make headlines, most ransom payouts are smaller and aimed at SMBs.

The reason cybercriminals prefer targeting SMBs lies in their limited resources and lack of cybersecurity expertise. As Aleks Farseev, SGTech exco member and co-founder/CEO of SoMin.ai, explained, there is often no one to investigate or track down perpetrators in the event of a security incident. Consequently, SMBs usually end up paying the ransom and hoping for the best.

Ransomware attacks are the biggest threat to SMBs, with more than 90% of all cyberattacks reported to Sophos last year involving data or credential theft. Christopher Budd, Sophos' director of X-Ops research, noted that cyber attackers could access entire operations by stealing credentials for one service or software application.

Introduction:
Imagine a future where air taxis and autonomous flying vehicles zip through the skies, bypassing traffic below. As we move toward this exciting reality, ensuring the safety and resilience of these hybrid electric aircraft is paramount. A team of engineers from Caltech, led by Soon-Jo Chung, has developed an innovative Machine Learning-based control method called ""Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance"" (NFFT). This groundbreaking system enables aircraft to detect and compensate for disturbances, allowing them to maintain control and continue flying despite various faults or failures.

The Challenge of Safety and Redundancy:
The hybrid-electric aircraft of the future will feature multiple propellers, or rotors, for redundancy. If one rotor fails, others can keep the aircraft airborne. However, adding fixed wings for energy efficiency increases the number of potential failure points. Traditional sensors for each rotor might not be sufficient, as they would not account for various types of failures and could add weight and expense to the aircraft.

The NFFT Solution:
Chung's team has developed a deep-learning method that combines real-life flight data with a neural network that learns and adapts in real-time based on a limited number of changing parameters. The system can detect and compensate for failures without requiring additional sensors or hardware. By observing the aircraft's attitude and position over time, NFFT can determine if the aircraft is deviating from its desired path and adjust its control signals accordingly.

Virtual Sensors and Real-Time Control:
NFFT's real-time control signals and algorithms can serve as virtual sensors for any vehicle, providing a cost-effective way to detect faults without adding physical sensors. The system has been tested on Caltech's Autonomous Flying Ambulance, a hybrid electric vehicle designed for rapid transportation of injured or ill individuals. NFFT has demonstrated its ability to maintain controllability even when a motor fails, making flying vehicles safer and more reliable.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently made headlines by voting to prohibit noncompete agreements, with a 3-2 decision. Noncompete agreements, which affect nearly one-fifth of American workers, have not been a significant concern in Silicon Valley, as they are unenforceable in California. This legal condition has reportedly given the region a competitive edge, enabling its workforce to venture into new projects without the constant fear of legal disputes with previous employers.

The FTC's ban could potentially extend similar freedoms to employees across the United States. According to the commission's estimates, this decision may lead to the formation of approximately 8,500 new startups each year, along with an additional 17,000 to 29,000 patents annually.

However, several factors must be taken into account:

1. The ban only targets noncompete agreements and not nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). Consequently, former employees may still face legal repercussions if their previous employer accuses them of sharing trade secrets.
2. While most existing noncompetes will lose enforceability, those concerning senior executives will remain valid.
3. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has announced its intention to sue the FTC over the new rule, arguing that the commission lacks the legal authority to implement such regulation.
