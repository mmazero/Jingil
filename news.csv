Indian social media titan ShareChat faces valuation drop to $2B post-funding round, but grows users & revenue amidst tough market conditions.

","

Indian social media giant ShareChat has seen a significant drop in its valuation, falling from nearly $5 billion to $2 billion following a recent funding round. This marks a significant decline for the 9-year-old startup that boasts over 400 million users in the South Asian market.

ShareChat, which operates two popular social networks supporting a dozen Indian languages as well as a short-form video app, announced on Monday that it had raised $49 million in a convertible round. However, the company strongly denied that its new valuation was below $2 billion, asserting there was “no valuation” attached to the round.

Despite this, existing investors, including Lightspeed, Temasek, Alkeon Capital, Moore Strategic Ventures, and HarbourVest, invested in the new round. Their debt will convert to equity at a valuation below $2 billion in the next round, according to a source with direct knowledge of the terms who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

ShareChat had faced a steep valuation cut in December 2022, despite having aggressively cut expenses and doubled its revenue. “When the market turned, we had to temper [acquisitions and creator payments] and move towards more profitable growth,” Ankush Sachdeva, ShareChat’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview.

The company has not spent money on user acquisition in the past year, Sachdeva said, crediting improvements to the startup’s content recommendation engine for driving user retention and engagement. ShareChat has also invested heavily in AI talent, particularly for senior roles in its London-based team. The company also doubled the ESOP grant for each employee in the firm as part of a special bonus grant.

Sachdeva said that the company has been able to pare down its single-largest expense, the cost of serving content. “When you fetch content on one of our apps, we do a lot of computation to find the 10 best content. To serve and consume that, there is another delivery cost. Optimizing this has helped us lower our burn,” he said.

ShareChat has reduced its monthly cash burn by 90% over the past two years while doubling revenue, attracting large FMCG firms and gaming companies as advertisers, the CEO said. The startup also remains committed to the short-video market in India, despite strong competition from YouTube and Instagram following the country’s ban on TikTok in 2020.

Despite the decline in valuation, ShareChat remains the largest app in India in terms of standalone usage. The company believes that its focus on live-streaming as a destination for entertainment and creator-user connections will differentiate it from its US rivals. ShareChat acquired local rival, MX TakaTak, in a deal valued over $700 million in 2022.

In conclusion, ShareChat’s decline in valuation is a significant blow to the Indian social media market. However, the company’s focus on profitability and user retention may help it bounce back in the future. As the short-video market continues to grow in India, ShareChat will need to maintain its competitive edge to remain a dominant force.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/bluesky-now-allows-heads-of-states-to-sign-up-for-the-social-network/,Bluesky now allows heads of states to sign up for the social network,Title: Bluesky Opens Doors to Heads of State on Its Social Networking Platform,"Title: Heads of State Now Welcome on Social Networking Platform, Bluesky

After being in an invite-only phase for nearly a year, social networking platform Bluesky recently made headlines by opening its doors to all users, including those who were previously restricted – namely, heads of state. As government officials worldwide begin to explore this new digital landscape, questions arise about how this change may impact user experience and content management. Let's dive into what this shift entails for both Bluesky and its diverse community of users.

Previously, Bluesky explicitly excluded public figures such as heads of state from signing up due to concerns related to potential misuse of the platform and the complexity involved in managing high-profile accounts. In a statement issued last year, the company requested users not to extend invites to these individuals until further notice. However, times have changed, and so has Bluesky's approach.

In light of upcoming general elections in several key regions, including the United States and India, Bluesky seems eager to promote open discourse between elected representatives and citizens alike. With the lifting of restrictions, notable leaders can participate in conversations surrounding critical topics while fostering transparency and engagement. But, how might this decision affect existing users and the overall health of the platform?

Throughout its existence, Bluesky has grappled with various moderation challenges, ranging from handling controversial content to addressing reports of harassment and discrimination. While some argue that incorporating heads of state may elevate the quality of discussions, others worry that increased polarization or partisanship could result. Consequently, implementing effective strategies to maintain civility and respectful dialogue becomes paramount.

To address past moderation struggles, Bluesky introduced features such as moderation lists and automated moderation tools late last year. More recently, the company revealed the ""Ozone"" tool, enabling users to create personalized moderation and labeling systems tailored to their preferences. By equipping users with these resources, Bluesky aims to strike a balance between freedom of expression and maintaining a safe space for meaningful interactions.

Despite these efforts, welcoming politicians onto the platform presents unique challenges that Bluesky must prepare for carefully. Elected officials often generate strong opinions among constituents; thus, curbing instances of incivility or abuse may prove challenging without stifling healthy debate altogether. Moreover, ensuring equal representation across varying ideologies remains crucial to preserving fairness and neutrality on the site.

Interestingly, Bluesky's competitor, Threads, maintains distance from endorsing political material, instead focusing on connecting people through shared interests and experiences.

Users can pool and control data use, monetize data, and prevent exploitation with Vana's secure platform and revenue model.","Title: Reclaim Your Data: Introducing Vana and the Reddit Data DAO

In the era of AI, data has become the new oil. It's being licensed, bought, and sold to train more capable and legally defensible AI-powered products. However, the individual creators and owners of this data rarely see any financial benefit. Enter Vana, a startup co-founded by Anna Kazlauskas and Art Abal, determined to change this narrative.

Anna Kazlauskas, a computer science and economics graduate from MIT, and Art Abal, a corporate lawyer turned impact sourcing expert, have created a platform that allows users to ""pool"" their data, such as chats, speech recordings, and photos, into datasets for generative AI model training. Vana's infrastructure enables users to own AI models and use their data across various applications.

The Vana API connects a user's cross-platform personal data to applications, allowing for instant access to a user's personalized AI model or underlying data. The platform aims to create amazing personalized experiences, such as daily motivational voicemails based on wellness goals or an art-generating app that understands your style preferences.

Creating an account with Vana is straightforward, and users can attach data to a digital avatar, like selfies, descriptions, and voice recordings, while exploring apps built using Vana's platform and datasets. The app selection includes ChatGPT-style chatbots, interactive storybooks, and even a Hinge profile generator.

But why would anyone willingly share their personal information with an anonymous startup in today's data-conscious world? Vana emphasizes user control and data privacy, ensuring users have the option to self-host their data and control how it's shared with apps and developers. Vana's revenue model, which includes a monthly subscription fee and a data transaction fee for developers, further discourages data exploitation.

Vana's mission extends to enabling users to monetize their data by licensing it to generative AI companies if they choose. The startup recently launched the Reddit Data DAO (Digital Autonomous Organization), allowing users to pool their Reddit data and decide collectively how it's used. After joining with a Reddit account, users submit a request for their data, upload it to the DAO, and gain the right to vote","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/reddit-ipo-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-13 16:15:41,"Meta Description:

Introduction

In a significant development for the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, OpenAI is expanding its reach by establishing a new office in Tokyo, Japan. This expansion goes hand in hand with the development of a GPT-4 model tailored explicitly for the Japanese language. This decision not only showcases the potential business opportunities OpenAI perceives in Japan but also emphasizes the importance of localizing technology to cater to various languages and cultures. As we navigate through the complexities and ethical implications of AI, having physical offices allows OpenAI to monitor and engage in conversations surrounding regulations and societal impact better.

Rising Competition in the Asian Market

While OpenAI benefits from widespread recognition, it faces competition in Japan from homegrown ventures like SoftBank's SB Intuitions, launched in November 2021. SB Intuitions focuses on creating large language models (LLMs) and generative AI services native to the Japanese language. With merely 1,200 employees worldwide, OpenAI must strategically expand to manage escalating demands since it is presently valued at approximately $80 billion. After inaugurating its first international office in London and its initial European Union (EU) office in Dublin, Tokyo marks OpenAI's first Asian outpost and fourth globally, including its San Francisco headquarters.

Targeting Strategic Regions

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, acknowledged Japan's ""rich history of people and technology working together"" as a motivation behind selecting the island nation for formal representation. However, OpenAI's expansion strategy appears deliberate, aiming to tap into regional strengths. For instance, the UK hosts exceptional AI talent, whereas the EU drives AI regulatory initiatives. Meanwhile, Japan excels in developing and implementing humanoid robots and AI-driven hardware, making it a prime destination during Altman's global tour in 2022. Additionally, Japan holds the G7 presidency and leads the G7's Hiroshima AI Process – an endeavor aimed at promoting AI safety along with robust AI governance.

Notable Leadership Choice

Selecting Tadao Nagasaki, former AWS executive, as head of OpenAI Japan indicates a strong emphasis on boosting OpenAI's corporate presence and offerings. Anticipating growth in enterprise collaborations, Nagasaki's responsibilities encompass cultivating a local team dedicated to enhancing OpenAI's Japanese operations. Currently, prominent clients include Daikin, Rakuten, and Toyota, all leveraging OpenAI's enterprise-oriented iteration of ChatGPT equipped with advanced privacy, data analytics, and personalization capabilities. Furthermore, local government entities utilize ChatGPT to streamline public services, indicating its versatility across industries.

Emphasis on Local Optimizations

Although ChatGPT adeptly handles multiple languages, fine-tuning the GPT LLM for Japanese specificity offers several advantages. Enhanced linguistic proficiency enables better appreciation of intricate facets of the Japanese language alongside culturally relevant knowledge, improving effectiveness—particularly in professional contexts involving customer support and content production. Moreover, OpenAI claims that the bespoke GPT-4 model provides superior functionality, resulting in quicker response times and reduced costs compared to previous versions. At present, select Japanese businesses enjoy exclusive access to the GPT-4 custom model, with broader availability unfolding over time through the OpenAI API in the forthcoming months.

Conclusion

Expanding into Japan represents a monumental stride for OpenAI, enabling deeper engagement in shaping AI policies, guidelines, and innovations. By focusing on key regions with unique technological landscapes and needs, OpenAI can foster synergies between diverse communities of researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers passionate about responsible AI development. Ultimately, these partnerships contribute significantly to unlocking AI's vast potential, propelling humanity towards exciting frontiers while ensuring equitable progress.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1647521480-e1694685235777.jpg?resize=1200,676",2024-04-15 09:34:45,"Meta Description:
