In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), a groundbreaking insight has emerged, revolutionizing how we understand and implement AI programs. Known as the ""lottery ticket hypothesis,"" this concept suggests that mammoth AI systems encompass smaller sections capable of performing the same tasks with fewer operations and less memory, thereby enhancing speed and reducing energy consumption.

Initiated by Jonathan Frankle and Michael Carbin in their 2019 paper, the lottery ticket hypothesis is now being harnessed in practical applications. Companies are discovering innovative methods to condense AI, enabling it to fit onto fewer GPU chips, requiring less memory and bandwidth.

A prime example showcases Meta's open-source Llama 2 large language model. In a recent study by a team of scholars from Meta's AI lab, MIT, Cisco Systems, and start-up Zyphra, it was found that eliminating up to half of Llama 2's layers reduced memory usage by a significant 75%. This breakthrough allows the program to operate on consumer-grade Nvidia or AMD GPUs rather than massive server racks.

Titled ""The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers,"" the study reveals that the latter, deeper layers of neural networks often contribute minimally to the final output. Employing the analogy of a marching band, the researchers compare the neural network layers to the various instruments. They found that the 'deeper' percussion instruments, such as drums and cymbals, have a negligible impact on the overall sound produced by the 'smaller' brass instruments and some tubas.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers 'pruned' layers of the network to assess the outcomes. By building upon previous studies, such as a 2022 MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory study, they discovered that removing the deeper layers had a limited effect on benchmark AI skills tests like question answering.

The researchers employed two techniques to remove layers. The first, a sophisticated approach, measured layer similarities and discarded those contributing little. The second, a simpler method, involved removing layers from the back of the neural net, followed by re-training, or fine-tuning, of the remaining layers to maintain performance.

This diverse ensemble boasts stars such as Billie Eilish, the Bob Marley estate, Chappell Roan, Elvis Costello, Greta Van Fleet, Imagine Dragons, Jon Bon Jovi, the Jonas Brothers, Kacey Musgraves, Katy Perry, Mac DeMarco, Miranda Lambert, Mumford & Sons, Nicki Minaj, Noah Kahan, Pearl Jam, Sheryl Crow, and Zayn Malik.

Their impassioned plea states, ""Unchecked AI poses colossal hazards to our capacity to safeguard privacy, identity, music, and livelihood."" Numerous prominent and influential corporations are reportedly utilizing artists' works without consent to train AI algorithms. Such actions threaten the financial stability of countless hardworking musicians attempting to eke out a living.

Indeed, AI-generated music, art, and literature rely upon vast databases filled with existing creations during the learning process. Consequently, requesting removal of one's own material often proves fruitless, much like preventing illicit sharing of music files—a feat difficult to accomplish given current technological capabilities. As deepfake technology advances, generating believable imitations of famous performers becomes increasingly feasible.

While some businesses strive to develop licensing agreements before releasing AI music generators, these innovations may still harm composers creating incidental music for advertising campaigns or those crafting beats potentially utilized by other artists. Unfortunately, musicians frequently suffer negative consequences when technology evolves.

Introduction

In the quest to create increasingly compact yet powerful electronic and optoelectronic devices, scientists are constantly seeking innovative solutions to overcome current limitations. One significant challenge lies in enhancing gate capacitance – the ability of a material to store electric charges relative to the applied voltage – in miniaturized devices without compromising other critical properties. This need has led researchers to explore alternative materials with high dielectric constants (high-κ) that can seamlessly integrate with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. Recently, a group of researchers from Fudan University introduced a novel 2D perovskite oxide called strontium niobate (Sr~2Nb~3O~10 or SNO) that meets these requirements (Li et al., 2024).

Understanding the Importance of High-κ Materials

For next-generation optoelectronic devices to function optimally while conserving energy, increasing gate capacitance becomes crucial. Although using traditional high-κ materials like hafnium dioxide (HfO2) appears beneficial, their integration with 2D materials presents difficulties. Therefore, identifying and creating new high-κ materials compatible with diverse 2D channel materials becomes vital for scaling down and improving the efficiency of optoelectronic systems.

Introducing Strontium Niobate (SNO): A Game Changer

Synthesized via a top-down method, SNO displays a high dielectric constant of approximately 24.6 and a moderate bandgap, making it an ideal candidate for phototransistor applications involving several 2D semiconducting materials, such as graphene, molybdenum disulfide (MoS~2), tungsten disulfide (WS~2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe~2). As demonstrated in Figure 1, when SNO is interfaced with MoS~2 and WS~2 channels, impressive results emerge.

 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS~2) transistors incorporating SNO display exceptional performance, featuring an on/off ratio of 10^6, supply voltage of 2 volts, and subthreshold swing of 88 millivolts per decade.
 Tungsten disulfide (WS~2) phototransistors integrated with SNO boast a remarkable photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio of around 10^6 and UV responsivity of 5.5 x 10^3 A W^-1 under both visible and UV light illuminations, thanks to the synergistic effects of gate control and charge transfer from the photoactive gate dielectric.

A Promising Future for Miniaturized Optoelectronics

The successful integration of SNO with multiple channel materials through straightforward procedures opens up exciting possibilities for further advancements in miniaturized optoelectronics. Among the most notable advantages offered by SNO include:

1. Efficient Gate Control: Due to the well-defined interface formed between the semiconductor and dielectric together with SNO's high-κ property, effective gate control over channel materials becomes possible.
2. Dual-Band Photodetection: By leveraging the unique capabilities of SNO-based phototransistors, UV-visible dual-band photodetection emerges, enabling distinct identification of UV and visible light illumination at individual terminals.

Conclusion

With the advent of strontium niobate (SNO) as a groundbreaking 2D perovskite oxide, the prospects for realizing superior, energy-efficient optoelectronic devices appear brighter than ever before. Through continuous exploration and innovation, research teams worldwide might unlock even more potential applications for SNO and similar high-κ photoactive materials, leading us towards a technologically advanced future.

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to automated customer service and content creation. However, with the increasing capabilities of AI, new concerns about its potential misuse have emerged. A recent study by Anthropic researchers discovered a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs) that could be exploited to make them perform inappropriate tasks, such as providing instructions on building harmful devices. This technique, known as ""many-shot jailbreaking,"" highlights the importance of understanding and addressing AI security.

The Many-Shot Jailbreaking Technique

Large language models with extensive context windows can now handle thousands of words and even entire books in their short-term memory. Anthropic researchers found that these models perform better on tasks when there are numerous examples of the task within the prompt. This phenomenon, called ""in-context learning,"" allows the model to improve its responses over time. Surprisingly, this also applies to inappropriate questions. If users ask a series of harmless questions before posing an inappropriate one, the model becomes more likely to comply.

The Mechanism Behind Many-Shot Jailbreaking

While the exact workings of LLMs remain a mystery, it is apparent that they can hone in on user intentions based on the content in the context window. As users ask more questions, the model seems to activate more latent knowledge related to the topic. This mechanism can be exploited to make LLMs perform inappropriate tasks.

Researchers at the University of Notre Dame have made this vision a reality by developing an innovative window coating that effectively blocks heat-generating ultraviolet and infrared light while allowing visible light to pass through. This groundbreaking invention has the potential to cut air-conditioning cooling expenses by more than one-third in hot climates.

Traditional window coatings are often optimized for light that enters a room at a 90-degree angle. However, at noon – frequently the hottest time of the day – sunlight strikes vertically installed windows at oblique angles. To tackle this challenge, a team led by Tengfei Luo, the Dorini Family Professor for Energy Studies at the University of Notre Dame, took a unique approach. They created a transparent window coating by stacking ultra-thin layers of silica, alumina, and titanium oxide on a glass base. To further enhance the structure's cooling power, they added a micrometer-thick silicon polymer that reflects thermal radiation through the atmospheric window and into outer space.

The key to optimizing the coating's performance across multiple angles of solar light was the use of quantum computing and, more specifically, quantum annealing. By employing an active learning and quantum computing scheme, the team efficiently shuffled the layers into an optimal configuration. This configuration maximized visible light transmission while minimizing the passage of heat-producing wavelengths, maintaining transparency and reducing temperature by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees Celsius (about 41 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit) in a model room.

The revolutionary window coating remains clear and effective even when tilted at various angles, much like polarized sunglasses that lessen the intensity of incoming light. This remarkable invention showcases the potential of advanced materials and quantum computing in transforming everyday objects into energy-saving solutions. The active learning and quantum computing scheme used to create this coating can be applied to design a wide range of materials with complex properties, paving the way for a more sustainable and energy-efficient future.

DALL-E, OpenAI's impressive text-to-image model, has been generating captivating images since its inception. Although users often had to fine-tune their prompts to create their ideal image, recent updates have streamlined this process. OpenAI introduced the DALL-E editor interface, enabling users to modify images directly within the platform.

What distinguishes DALL-E's editor interface from other AI image generators is its conversational editing feature. By clicking the ""select"" button, users highlight the image area they wish to alter and type in their desired change. For instance, requesting ""remove bird"" or ""add cherry blossoms"" modifies the image accordingly.

The DALL-E editor interface also allows for more general edits. In the conversation panel, users can type commands like ""make it black and white"" to apply changes to the entire image. This functionality is accessible through the ChatGPT app, where users can edit images by clicking the ""Edit"" button and entering their desired change in the conversation panel.

Since February 21, new customers cannot access DALL-E 2, as OpenAI now directs users to DALL-E 3. This version is available for ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and through the OpenAI API. Current DALL-E 2 users may still access the platform if they've purchased credits or received free credits before the change.

To use the DALL-E editor interface, a ChatGPT Plus subscription is required, costing $20 per month. However, those unwilling to pay can access DALL-E 3 in Microsoft Designer for free. With its new editor interface, DALL-E continues to innovate AI image generation, providing a more user-friendly experience.

Users simply need to click the 'select' button represented by a paintbrush icon, choose the section they want to modify, and then input a command describing what they would like to add or remove.
For instance, typing ""remove bird"" or ""add cherry blossoms"" makes corresponding modifications to the chosen part of the picture.

Meta's new age verification system on the Quest VR store tailors experiences, settings, and safeguards based on user ages, with parental tools and stricter guidelines for preteens.","Title: Embracing Responsibility: Meta's Age Verification System on Quest VR Store

Introduction

In recent years, there has been increasing concern over children's safety and exposure to unsuitable content on digital platforms. During a congressional online safety hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that app store providers, such as Apple and Google, ought to take charge of implementing parental controls for social media. Taking a step towards assuming responsibility, Meta now demonstrates its vision through its Quest VR store. This article explores Meta's new age verification system on the Quest VR store, enabling better protection and customized experiences for different age groups.

The New Age Confirmation Process

As of recently, Meta started prompting Quest 2 and 3 users to reconfirm their ages by inputting their correct birthdates. By doing so, Meta aims to offer tailored experiences, settings, and safeguards based on individual ages. Specifically, teenage users between 13 and 17 will find their profiles automatically configured to private mode. Additionally, parental supervision tools become accessible, allowing caregivers to adjust settings according to their preferences and ensure a safe virtual reality environment for their teens. Preteens aged 10 to 12 must adhere to stricter guidelines; parents need to create dedicated accounts for them and manage available applications accordingly.

Consequences of Ignoring Prompts

Account holders receive a 30-day grace period during which they can confirm their ages. Failure to comply results in temporary account suspension until the necessary information is provided. To prevent false declarations, Meta requires those who mistakenly entered incorrect birthdates to validate their identities via government-issued IDs or credit cards.

Age Group Identification & User Age Group APIs

By March 2024, Meta expects developers to specify their target demographic—whether focused on preteens, teens, or adults. Furthermore, Meta introduced its user age group APIs last month, empowering developers to inform the platform if a particular user is underaged for their application.

History of Parental Control Tools

Meta initially rolled out parental supervision features for its VR headsets back in 2022, followed by introducing parent-managed accounts for preteens last year. These proactive measures reflect Meta's dedication to ensuring a secure yet enjoyable digital landscape for all users.

Conclusion

With increased focus on protecting minors online, Meta's implementation of an age confirmation process on its Quest VR store represents significant progress in promoting responsible access to virtual reality environments. By providing tailored experiences and enhanced oversight capabilities, Meta continues prioritizing user wellbeing while fostering creativity and innovation across its expansive ecosystem.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meta-quest-vr-preteen-age-verification.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-02 15:27:31,"Meta Description: Meta introduces an age verification system on the Quest VR store, ensuring tailored experiences and safe environments for different age groups.

In recent times, artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated various industries, offering endless possibilities for innovation. However, this rapid technological growth may have severe implications for the music industry. More than 200 prominent artists, hailing from diverse genres and eras, have united to address the colossal risks AI poses to music creation.

The Artist Rights Alliance, an organization advocating for musicians, drafted an open letter, initially published by Variety, urging caution and respect for artistic integrity. Signatories include renowned figures such as Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, the estates of Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra, Billie Eilish, Jon Bon Jovi, and Smokey Robinson. To view the entire list of signatures, check out the original Variety article.

This powerful collective voice expresses concern regarding two primary aspects:

1. Unauthorized utilization of artist voices to train AI models
2. Predatory practices diminishing human creativity

The letter emphasizes, ""[W]e call on AI developers, technology companies, platforms, and digital music services to cease the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists."" While acknowledging AI's capacity to foster creativity, the authors stress its potential to undermine artists, songwriters, musicians, and other stakeholders, thereby threatening their livelihoods.

Companies employing artist voices without permission to train AI systems directly aim to replace human artists, according to the letter. Such actions risk instigating a race to the bottom, jeopardizing fair compensation for creators. The open letter concludes with a strong stance: ""We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal professional artists' voices and likenesses, violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem.""

Addressing the concerns raised in the letter, companies, platforms, and digital music services are urged to commit not to develop or implement AI-generated music technology, tools, or content. By doing so, they would support the preservation of authentic musical expression and equitable remuneration for artists.

The debate surrounding AI in entertainment has intensified in recent years. In 2024, Congressional hearings were held to discuss the matter, while Tennessee enacted legislation safeguarding artists. In 2023, Hollywood screenwriters embarked on a strike due to AI-generated content, and Spotify opted to eliminate AI-generated material mimicking genuine voices.

As AI continues to shape the future of music, striking a balance between technological progression and artistic protection remains crucial. It is essential to ensure that musicians receive appropriate recognition and compensation for their contributions, fostering a sustainable environment where both humans and machines collaborate harmoniously in creating captivating melodies and rhythms.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/48e24404db64d2ff95a8af9ca3b1f712a1954aa4/2024/04/02/286d31a4-7b19-456e-9073-4a5d3fc79d72/rovotmusicgettyimages-1471299905.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-02 12:38:00,"Protect Musicians!
