https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080, Climate change impact: MIT tool shows loss of outdoor days by 2080 | The Conversation,"We are in the midst of a climate crisis, and scientists are working tirelessly to understand how it will impact different regions and populations. A tool developed by MIT allows people to see how many outdoor days they can expect in their area, depending on how much carbon emissions growth is allowed. The results of this tool can help people prepare for the future and avoid making decisions that will harm themselves and others.

According to the MIT tool, people in California, France, and Germany can expect to have a slightly more temperate climate and a few to several more outdoor days in the coming years. However, some temperate regions like New York and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. The worst impact will be felt by countries with vulnerable populations like Nigeria and India, which will lose almost two and a half months of outdoor days, respectively.

Despite the grim prognosis, it is not too late. If the world can reduce carbon emissions by 2050, the situation will improve dramatically. Even if this goal is missed, by 2070, the impact of climate change will still be significantly reduced.

Climate scenario analysis is a field that is becoming increasingly important as we more fully understand the impact of climate change. This tool developed by MIT is just one example of how this field is being used to help people prepare for the future. Other startups are also using this technology to help investors, lenders, and insurers understand the risks associated with climate change.

As climate change continues to impact our world, it is essential to stay informed and take action to mitigate its effects. This tool and others like it can help us make informed decisions that will benefit not only ourselves but also future generations.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"This Meta Description is under 20 words and includes a call to action to stay informed and take action to mitigate the effects of climate change.

The feature is still in the early stages of development, and Instagram hasn't shared any details about its release date or functionality.

According to a screenshot shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, Blend will generate a personalized feed of Reels based on the interests of both users. If a user invites a friend to a Blend, Instagram will generate a feed of Reels that it believes they will both enjoy. The feature is designed to be private and can be left at any time.

Blend's purpose is to help users discover new Reels together, which could boost the app's discovery and watch time. Instagram already allows users to share Reels via DMs, so the feature could help the app use that data to proactively recommend and display Reels that users might enjoy.

While Blend is still a prototype, it could give Instagram a slight competitive edge over its rival, TikTok. Though the two apps are similar, the introduction of Blend could help Instagram stand out in the short-form video market.

In conclusion, Blend is an exciting new feature that Instagram is developing to help users discover new Reels together.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/openai-custom-voice-engine-preview/,"OpenAI built a voice cloning tool, but you can’t use it… yet"," ""OpenAI Voice Cloning Tool: AI-Generated Voices without Legal Issues Yet"" ","As deepfakes continue to proliferate, OpenAI is refining the technology used to clone voices. Today, the company is previewing its Voice Engine, an expansion of its existing text-to-speech API that allows users to upload any 15-second voice sample to generate a synthetic copy of that voice. However, there is no date for public availability yet, giving the company time to respond to how the model is used and abused.

OpenAI is taking a responsible approach to voice cloning by training its generative AI model on a mix of licensed and publicly available data. However, the company has faced legal challenges for allegedly violating IP law by training its AI on copyrighted content without providing credit or payment to the creators or owners. OpenAI has licensing agreements with some content providers and allows webmasters to block its web crawler from scraping their site for training data. Additionally, artists can opt out of and remove their work from the data sets used to train the company's image-generating models. However, OpenAI does not offer an opt-out scheme for its other products.

The Voice Engine model is not trained or fine-tuned on user data. Instead, it generates realistic speech that matches the original speaker by simultaneously analyzing speech and text data. The audio that is used is dropped after the request is complete. OpenAI's approach delivers overall higher-quality speech, and the product is aggressively priced at $15 per one million characters or around 18 hours of audio. However, this price comes at the expense of some customization, as Voice Engine does not offer controls to adjust tone, pitch, or cadence.

In conclusion, OpenAI is refining the technology used to clone voices, while taking a responsible approach to ensure that the model is used ethically. The company is training its generative AI model on a mix of licensed and publicly available data and offering an affordable pricing model for its Voice Engine product. However, the lack of customization and potential IP legal challenges may limit its use in certain applications.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/openAI-pattern-04.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 17:00:58,"""Revolutionize voice cloning technology with OpenAI's Voice Engine - generate realistic speech from any 15-second voice sample.

Are large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT really as accurate as they claim to be? While these AI systems have been making waves in recent years for their ability to write papers, answer questions, and even solve math problems, they suffer from one significant drawback: their results need to be manually checked for accuracy.

This is where a new AI-based system developed by a team of researchers at Google's DeepMind comes in. Called SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator), this system can automatically check the accuracy of LLM responses and highlight any inaccuracies.

The SAFE system works by breaking down claims or facts in an answer provided by the original LLM and then using Google Search to find relevant sources for verification. It then compares the two answers to determine their accuracy.

To test the SAFE system, the research team verified approximately 16,000 facts contained in answers given by several LLMs. They compared their results with human (crowdsourced) fact-checkers and found that the SAFE system matched their findings 72% of the time. In cases of disagreements between SAFE and the human checkers, the researchers found that SAFE was correct 76% of the time.

The code for the SAFE system is now available for anyone to use on the open-source site GitHub. This means that anyone can take advantage of its capabilities and make the process of fact-checking LLM responses more efficient and accurate.

The paper describing the SAFE system, ""Long-form factuality in large language models,"" is available on arXiv, and the code release can be found on GitHub.

In conclusion, the SAFE system developed by the team at DeepMind is an exciting new development in the world of AI and language models. By automating the fact-checking process, this system can help to ensure that LLM responses are accurate and reliable, making them more valuable to users.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/iron-sheepdog-is-fixing-short-haul-trucking-from-the-bottom-up/,Iron Sheepdog is fixing short-haul trucking from the bottom up," Revolutionizing Short-Haul Trucking: Iron Sheepdog's Software Simplifies Hiring, Boosts Efficiency ","Introduction:

Iron Sheepdog, a Williamsburg, Virginia-based technology company, is revolutionizing the short-haul trucking industry with its software. The company's platform streamlines the process of hiring short-haul truckers, making it more efficient and transparent for companies and truckers alike. This blog post explores Iron Sheepdog's approach to building software for the short-haul trucking industry, its growth since its founding, and its recent $10 million Series B financing round.

Body:

Iron Sheepdog's software is designed to simplify the short-haul trucking industry, which involves outsourcing short-haul jobs to truckers booked through brokers. The company's software enables companies to track their contracted trucks, giving them more transparency into where trucks are, how long a job takes, and how much to pay. The truckers themselves receive an easy-to-use app that helps them accept jobs and get paid online.

Iron Sheepdog's success can be attributed to its bottom-up approach to building software for the short-haul trucking industry. Instead of focusing on contractors to drive adoption, the company started with the short-haul truck drivers themselves. The company made a simple app for the subhauler (the short-haul truck driver) that was tied to 24-hour pay. This approach encouraged truckers to adopt the app, and the brokers who supplied their jobs followed suit.

Iron Sheepdog's growth has been impressive, with the company's revenue doubling each year since its founding. The company's focus on adoption has been a key factor in its success. Van Sickel, Iron Sheepdog's co-founder and CEO, emphasizes the importance of trust in the industry and the need for software solutions to be embraced by all stakeholders.

Iron Sheepdog's software has the potential to revolutionize the short-haul trucking industry by reducing the number of trucks needed to complete jobs. For example, a company could hire a truck to do two jobs on the same day or drop off material at two sites, reducing the number of trucks needed. This, in turn, could help reduce emissions.

Iron Sheepdog's recent $10 million Series B financing round stands out for several reasons. Firstly, investment in construction tech startups has grown in recent years, but this part of the system has not seen the same attention. Secondly, innovation around trucking has largely overlooked this area, and Iron Sheepdog is one of the few, if not the only, venture-backed startup tackling this problem.

Conclusion:

Iron Sheepdog's bottom-up approach to building software for the short-haul trucking industry has been a key factor in its success. The company's focus on adoption has been a critical element in its growth, and its software has the potential to revolutionize the short-haul trucking industry. The recent $10 million Series B financing round highlights the growing interest in construction tech startups and the need for technology solutions to be embraced by all stakeholders in the industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ISD_broker-truck.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 16:00:39,"Optimize your fleet with Iron Sheepdog's innovative trucking software—efficient, transparent, and trusted.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-openai-unveils-voice-cloning-tool.html,OpenAI unveils voice-cloning tool,Voice Technology: Balancing Innovation and Ethical Use,"

The Evolution of Voice Technology: Balancing Innovation with Ethical Use

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the development of voice-cloning technology has marked a significant milestone. This innovation, which allows for the replication of a person's speech with just a brief audio sample, has opened up a world of possibilities in various fields, from entertainment to education. However, it also brings forth a myriad of ethical considerations, particularly in the realm of consent and misuse.

Recently, a leading AI research organization introduced a cutting-edge voice synthesis model, aptly named ""Voice Engine."" This tool demonstrated its prowess by accurately mimicking speech patterns based on a mere 15-second clip. The implications of such a capability are profound, offering a glimpse into a future where digital voices are indistinguishable from their human counterparts.

The organization's announcement was met with a mix of excitement and concern. The potential for misuse is not lost on the developers or the broader community, especially in light of the upcoming election cycle—a time when the integrity of information is paramount. To address these concerns, the organization has engaged with a diverse array of global partners, spanning government agencies, media outlets, and civil society organizations, to gather insights and feedback on the responsible deployment of this technology.

The conversation around voice cloning is particularly relevant in the context of disinformation. As AI tools become more accessible and difficult to detect, the risk of their exploitation in spreading false narratives increases. This concern was underscored by a recent incident involving a deceptive robocall that mimicked a prominent political figure's voice, urging voters to abstain from participating in a primary election. The event served as a stark reminder of the potential for deepfake technology to disrupt democratic processes.

In response to these challenges, the organization has taken a measured approach to releasing the Voice Engine. Partners involved in testing the tool have agreed to stringent guidelines, including obtaining explicit consent from individuals whose voices are replicated and ensuring transparency with audiences regarding the use of AI-generated voices. Additionally, the organization has implemented safety features such as watermarking to trace the origins of synthesized audio and proactive monitoring of the tool's application.

As we navigate the complexities of synthetic voice technology, it is crucial to strike a balance between harnessing its benefits and safeguarding against its risks. The collaborative efforts of researchers, policymakers, and society at large will be instrumental in shaping a future where innovation coexists with ethical responsibility.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/tiktok-ban-implication-amazon/,TikTok ban could harm Amazon sellers looking for alternatives, TikTok Shop grows as Amazon alternative for sellers despite ban risk ,"TikTok a viable alternative to Amazon for sellers looking for new channels. In recent months, merchants from China have flocked to the app to sell their products to U.S. buyers through TikTok Shop. However, the interplay of tech giants and geopolitics is making it difficult for smaller merchants to expand their businesses on the platform.

Despite the geopolitical tensions and potential ban, TikTok Shop has already gained traction, with 200,000 merchants on board. However, the app has not provided any updated numbers on how many merchants are currently on the platform, nor how much they sell there, nor how many sell elsewhere (and where else that might be). Research from Jungle Scout suggests that 20% of Amazon sellers, brands, and businesses have plans to expand to TikTok Shop this year.

The rise of TikTok is not the only platform on the list for merchants looking for more channels beyond Amazon. Its focus on branded goods and curation, as well as its ability to generate massive engagement, make it a direct competitor to Amazon. TikTok has also been offering incentives to merchants to sell goods at a steep discount during the Black Friday sales period.

Merchants have been interested in selling on TikTok simply because the app generates massive engagement. According to a survey from Tabcut, nearly 70% of sellers reported an increase in sales year-over-year for the first 11 months of 2023. Additionally, nearly 20% of consumers began their search for products on TikTok in the first quarter of 2023, up 44% from a year ago.

TikTok has the opportunity to reshape how America's younger generations shop online. With 52% of TikTok's U.S. users aged 18-34, the app can appeal to a younger demographic that is more likely to use social media for shopping.

In conclusion, TikTok is growing its focus on e-commerce and has become an attractive alternative to Amazon for sellers looking for new channels. Despite the potential ban, the app has gained traction and has the opportunity to reshape how America's younger generations shop online. However, the interplay of geopolitics and tech giants is making it difficult for smaller merchants to expand their businesses on the platform.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=1200,669",2024-03-30 17:00:02,"""Sell your products on TikTok: A viable alternative to Amazon for merchants looking to reach new audiences.

In a major security breach, AT&T has reset millions of customer account passcodes after a cache of sensitive customer data was leaked online earlier this month. The U.S. telco giant initiated the mass-reset after TechCrunch informed it that the encrypted passcodes in the leaked data could be used to access customer accounts.

AT&T has confirmed that the leaked data belongs to its customers, three years after a hacker claimed to have stolen 73 million AT&T customer records. The source of the leak remains inconclusive, but the leaked data includes personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

Security researcher Sam ""Chick3nman"" Croley analyzed the leaked data and found that each record contains the encrypted password in an easily decipherable format. By correlating encrypted passwords to surrounding account data, such as customer dates of birth, house numbers, and partial Social Security numbers and phone numbers, Croley was able to reverse-engineer which encrypted values matched which plaintext passwords.

AT&T will contact all of the 7.6 million existing customers whose passcodes it reset, as well as current and former customers whose personal information was compromised. It is important for customers to change their account passwords and be cautious of potential phishing attacks.

This breach highlights the importance of strong and unique passwords, as well as the need for companies to take cybersecurity seriously and implement robust measures to protect customer data.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/x-confirms-plans-for-nsfw-communities/,X confirms plans for NSFW Communities, X Confirms Plans for NSFW Communities: Embracing Adult Content on Twitter ,"X, the company formerly known as Twitter, has made a significant change to its Communities feature by allowing community admins to set an ""Adult Content"" label in their settings. This change is intended to avoid having community content auto-filtered and to directly embrace the adult content that has long been present on the platform. NSFW content, which plays a major role on X and has been a primary advertising venue for sex workers and home to a large amount of adult content-focused bots and spam, has been a significant factor in the platform's growth and success.
It's worth noting that X's Communities feature is a relatively new product that has been promoted by owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino as a key component of the platform's growth plans. According to a transcript obtained by The Verge, Musk explained that the product was growing fast but needed more work to make it compelling. He also shared that X was seeing ""rapid percentage growth"" in Communities and had been adding new features, like the ability to include any X account's feed in the Community feed.
While the inclusion of adult content may raise some ethical concerns, it's important to recognize that this is a significant change that reflects the platform's recognition of the role that adult content plays in its user's experiences. As such, X has made a number of other updates to its Communities feature to make it more user-friendly and engaging. These updates include the ability for admins to add topics to their communities, as well as the introduction of tools to sort posts by trending, most recent, and most liked.
Musk also commented on the updates, saying ""Many upgrades to X Communities!"" The post suggests that these updates are not limited to just the inclusion of adult content and that the platform is working to make Communities a successful product, potentially serving as a competitor to larger forum sites like Reddit and hosting training data for Musk's xAI-run chatbot Grok.
Overall, the changes to X's Communities feature reflect the platform's ongoing efforts to adapt to the needs and preferences of its users. While the inclusion of adult content may raise some ethical concerns, the platform has also made significant updates to its Communities feature to make it more user-friendly and engaging. As such, it's important for users to be informed of these changes and to use the platform in a responsible manner.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 16:07:11,"X has updated its Communities feature by allowing community admins to set an ""Adult Content"" label in their settings, embracing the role of adult content in its user's experiences.

This is where Space and Time comes in. The web3 startup aims to be the verifiable computing layer for the future of AI and blockchain technology.

Scott Dykstra, CTO and co-founder of Space and Time, discussed the importance of data transparency and web3 technology on TechCrunch’s Chain Reaction podcast. According to Dykstra, the FTX collapse is a prime example of the need for data transparency in the financial industry. When organizations are incentivized to manipulate their records, it can become problematic, and this issue transcends beyond the fintech industry.

The solution to this problem is through verification of data and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs), which are cryptographic actions used to prove something about a piece of information without revealing the origin data itself. ZK proofs can be used to verify and retrieve data, making it possible to verify and retrieve information without disclosing the exact number.

Space and Time aims to be that verifiable computing layer for web3 by indexing data both off-chain and on-chain, but Dykstra sees it expanding beyond the industry and into others. The startup has indexed from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, Sui, Avalanche, Sei, and Aptos and is adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

One of Dykstra’s recent concerns is that AI data isn’t really verifiable. He believes that there needs to be a decentralized, but globally, always available database that can be created through blockchains. Everyone needs to access it, and it cannot be a monopoly.

In a hypothetical scenario, Dykstra suggests that OpenAI itself cannot be the proprietor of a database of a journal for which journalists are creating content. Instead, it has to be something that’s owned by the community and operated by the community in a way that’s readily available and uncensorable.

In conclusion, Space and Time is an innovative web3 startup that aims to be the verifiable computing layer for the future of AI and blockchain technology. The company is addressing the need for data transparency and web3 technology by indexing data both off-chain and on-chain and believes that everyone needs access to a decentralized, but globally, always available database that can be created through blockchains.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1828490321.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 17:00:55,"Space and Time is a web3 startup that aims to be the verifiable computing layer for the future of AI and blockchain technology.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/supaglue-stripe-acquire-acquisition/,"How a tiny 4-person startup, Supaglue, caught Stripe’s eye"," Stripe Acquires Supaglue for $50M Annually, Boosts Revenue and Finance Automation Unit ","Stripe's annual letter revealed several areas of fast growth for the payments giant, including the ""Revenue and Finance Automation"" unit. Stripe's RFA unit is expected to reach a $500 million annual run rate this year. To support this growth, the company completed an ""acqui-hire"" of a four-person team from Supaglue, an open-source developer platform for user-facing integrations.

Supaglue, formerly known as Supergrain, was founded by George Xing and Thomas Chen in 2021 after working on data teams at Lyft and Uber. They noticed that managing data and business metrics across teams was inconsistent and fragmented, which could lead to bad decisions and even worse business outcomes. Supaglue built a product that helps companies import and centralize customer data from third-party data sources like Salesforce or other customer relationship management systems into their own applications.

Stripe's acqui-hire of Supaglue is one of many exciting developments for the company so far this year. Supaglue's unified data platform, which reconciles data from each of Stripe's products and surfaces relevant insights to end-users via dashboards, alerts, customer reporting, and real-time analytics, is a perfect fit for Stripe's RFA suite. This acquisition is likely to quickly lead to new partnerships and growth opportunities for both companies.

Stripe has been busy this year, securing partnerships with companies like authentication startup Clerk and electric boat startup Navier, and also completing an employee stock sale deal. With this growth and expansion, Stripe is well-positioned to continue leading the payments and financial technology industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1110.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 13:30:19,"Learn more about Stripe's ""Revenue and Finance Automation"" unit and their recent acqui-hire of Supaglue in this insightful article.

As the founder of FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and a key player in the industry's political sphere, SBF seemed untouchable. However, after a lengthy trial and conviction, he will now be behind bars for up to 25 years.
The crypto industry is no stranger to scandal and controversy, and SBF's downfall is just one example of the risks that come with investing in this high-risk, high-reward space. Despite the recent surge in token prices and trading volume, many in the industry are eager to put the past behind them and move forward.
As we reflect on SBF's fall from grace, it's worth taking a closer look at the circumstances that led to his conviction. From his early days at MIT to his founding of FTX, SBF's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies was marked by ambition, innovation, and a willingness to take risks. However, his actions during the FTX hack in 2021 and his subsequent attempt to cover up the incident ultimately proved to be his downfall.
The FTX hack was one of the most significant events in the history of cryptocurrencies, as it led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets. SBF's attempt to cover up the incident and mislead investors only made matters worse, ultimately leading to his arrest and conviction.
As we look to the future of the cryptocurrency industry, it's clear that SBF's downfall serves as a cautionary tale for those who are willing to take risks in this high-stakes space. While the industry is still in its early stages, it's important for investors and entrepreneurs to be aware of the potential dangers and to take steps to mitigate them.
In the end, the crypto industry will likely move on from the SBF saga, but the memory of his downfall will serve as a reminder of the importance of transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior in this rapidly evolving field.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SBF-TC-Minute-YT.png?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 16:00:11,"Meta Description: ""Learn about the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX and key player in the cryptocurrency industry, after his conviction for covering up an FTX hack.

Get ready for a big change in the world of podcasting! Google is shutting down its popular Podcasts app in the US. The app, which has been around for over a decade, has been a go-to destination for podcast lovers. But, as of April 2, users in the US will need to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music.

The Google Podcasts app has been a simple and streamlined platform for discovering, following, and listening to podcasts, as well as tools to add podcasts by RSS feed. Unfortunately, Google announced last September that they would begin to wind down the app as part of their plan to centralize their audio services under YouTube.

YouTube Music, which has been around for a few years now, has been supporting podcasts globally since the end of 2023, and they now have the ability to upload their RSS feeds. The move to shift podcasting over to YouTube could help Google become a bigger player in the space. Not only will they be able to combine their efforts and sharpen their focus, but they will also be able to take advantage of the rising popularity of video podcasts, which are already popular on YouTube.

Spotify recently announced a deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) to bring video podcasts to U.S. users of their streaming app after earlier in March announcing tests of video podcasts in 11 other markets around the world. This shows that interest in video podcasts is on the rise.

Google has not yet provided a timeline for the rest of the world, but they have confirmed that users in the US will only be able to use the Podcasts app through the end of March 2024. For those who miss the in-app pop-ups, Google will offer users additional time to save their subscriptions by allowing them to use the app's export feature through July 2024.

In conclusion, the end of the Google Podcasts app is a big change for podcast lovers. But, with the rise of video podcasts and the centralization of audio services under YouTube, Google is positioning itself to become a bigger player in the space. It's important for users to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music to continue streaming their favorite shows.

","Hey there, tech enthusiasts! Welcome to our weekly recap of the latest happenings in the tech world. This week, we've got some exciting news to share with you all.

First off, let's talk about Fisker, the electric vehicle startup that's been making waves in the industry. It was revealed that the company temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries. This led to an internal audit that took months to complete. Unfortunately, this setback has had a significant impact on the company's operations.

Moving on, Facebook has been in the news for a rather disturbing reason. According to court documents, the company was involved in a secret project known internally at Meta as ""Project Ghostbusters."" The goal of this project was to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat's app and its servers. This raises serious concerns about privacy and user security.

Speaking of privacy, Stability AI, the startup behind the popular image generation tool Stable Diffusion, has also been in the headlines. The company's founder and CEO, Emad Mostaque, recently resigned from the company amid an ongoing struggle for stability at the company. With little revenue to show for it, it remains to be seen whether Stability AI can bounce back from this setback.

There was also some exciting news in the world of AI. Google has announced an upgrade to its Search Generative Experience that allows users to ask Google Search to plan a travel itinerary. Using AI, Search will draw on ideas from websites around the web along with reviews, photos, and other details to help users plan their perfect trip.

In addition to these developments, several companies have secured funding this week. Copilot, the budgeting app, raised $6 million in a Series A round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Meanwhile, canned water startup Liquid Death raised a massive $67 million in funding, bringing its total raised to over $267 million.

We also learned about a new venture that aims to help homeowners manage their HVAC and plumbing systems more efficiently. PipeDreams, a startup founded by Dan Laufer, a former Nextdoor exec, has raised $25 million from Canvas Ventures and others to develop software that helps with scheduling and marketing.
