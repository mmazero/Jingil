https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Outdoor Days in 2100: Who Loses the Most?"" ","Introduction

The Earth's climate is a complex and ever-changing system that affects every aspect of our lives. From heatwaves to droughts and storms, the climate is becoming increasingly unpredictable and challenging to navigate. However, a recent development from researchers at MIT may offer some insight into what the future holds.

Outdoor Days

The MIT tool allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked. Outdoor days refer to the number of days each year that a person can spend outdoors without it being too hot or too cold. The results of the study are alarming, with some areas experiencing a significant loss of outdoor days due to rising temperatures.

For people in California, France, Germany, and the UK, the climate will be slightly more clement, with an added few days to nearly a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records. However, some temperate places like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. Elsewhere, the picture looks even more dire. Illinois and Texas will lose a month and a half each for the same reason.

The countries with the most vulnerable populations will suffer the most, with Nigeria's summers growing even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India will lose almost two and a half months, and other regions in Africa and Asia will also experience significant reductions in outdoor days.

Assessing Risk

The MIT tool is a relatable application of a field of study known as climate scenario analysis. This branch of strategic planning seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. The tool helps assess the risk of different climate scenarios and their impact on different regions and populations.

Other startups are also using this predictive capability to help give shape to an uncertain future. Many of these startups are focused on providing solutions for investors, lenders, and insurers. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on these markets, supplying customers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. These startups also determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought and deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains. They can also crank out regulatory disclosures, highlighting relevant climate","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"Meta Description: ""Predict the future of outdoor days with the MIT tool.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork"," AWS, Google, Oracle back Valkey Redis fork: Positive development for open-source community ","The Linux Foundation recently announced that it will host Valkey, a fork of the Redis in-memory data store. Valkey is backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap. This comes as a result of Redis Labs switching Redis away from the permissive 3-clause BSD license and adopting the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL) in March. The new license requires commercial agreements to offer Redis-as-a-service, making it incompatible with the standard definition of “open source.”

Redis is a popular data store that is at the core of many large commercial and open-source deployments. Its history with the open-source community has been turbulent, with licensing disputes and changes in the licensing model. In 2021, Redis Labs changed how it licenses its Redis Modules, which included visualization tools, a client SDK, and more. The change restricted others from selling and hosting these modules, despite Redis Labs stating that the license for open-source Redis remained BSD.

The recent change to the licensing model has opened the door for cloud service providers (CSPs) to establish fair licensing agreements with Redis Inc. AWS, Google Cloud, and other large cloud vendors have rallied behind Valkey, a fork of Redis that is backed by these companies. The community of Redis maintainers, including Olson and Zhao, have also joined the project.

The Valkey community will welcome the maintainers from Redis with open arms, despite their initial reluctance to contribute to the new license. The change has been met with disappointment and frustration from the community, but Redis Inc. is well within its rights to make this change.

Valkey is a viable option for organizations that want to continue using Redis while avoiding the restrictive licensing model. AWS, Google Cloud, and other cloud vendors have recognized the need for a more flexible licensing model that aligns with the needs of the open-source community. Valkey will provide a platform for innovation and collaboration, while still maintaining the core principles of the original Redis project.

In conclusion, the creation of Valkey is a positive development for the Redis community and the open-source movement. It provides a viable option for organizations that want to continue using Redis while avoiding the restrictive licensing model.

The text provided is a scientific article that discusses the development of high-density monolithically integrated vOECT arrays fabricated by e-beam exposure. The text is written in technical language and includes diagrams and figures to illustrate the process.

Rewritten Instructions:

The world of electronics is constantly evolving, and organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are no exception. These transistors are an emerging class of transistors that are made from organic superconducting materials and have the ability to modulate electrical current in response to small changes in the voltage applied to their gate electrode. OECTs have several advantages, including promising amplification and sensing capabilities, low driving voltages, and a versatile structure.

However, despite these advantages, most conventional OECTs developed so far have been found to exhibit various limitations, including limited stability and slow redox processes, which can significantly impair their performance. To address these limitations, researchers at Northwestern University have developed a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs.

Their proposed approach was used to create various electronic components based on OECT arrays and circuits. The researchers used electron-beam lithography (eBL) to pattern both p- and n-channel organic semiconductor films, resulting in ultra-small and high-density well-defined conducting channel regions. The eBL strategy employed by the researchers enabled the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits.

The resulting p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays exhibited transconductances of 0.08–1.7 S and transient times of less than 100 μs, with stable switching properties of more than 100,000 cycles. Furthermore, the researchers successfully used their fabrication strategy to create various vertically stacked logic circuits, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates, which performed remarkably well and maintained excellent operational stability.

In conclusion, this recent study highlights the potential of eBL in enhancing the stability and performance of OECT circuits. The scalable fabrication of OECTs facilitated by this approach could contribute to their integration into electronic devices, paving the way for the development of various brain-inspired and wearable technologies.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/high-density-vertical.jpg,2024-03-31 09:00:01,"High-density and flexible OECT circuits fabricated by eBL: A promising approach for enhancing stability and performance.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/this-week-in-ai-let-us-not-forget-the-humble-data-annotator/,This Week in AI: Let us not forget the humble data annotator,"""Labeling and Annotation: Essential for Modern AI, but Ethical Concerns Persist""","

In the world of AI, keeping up with the latest developments can be a daunting task. With so much happening in the field, it's essential to stay informed and up-to-date. This week, we will turn the spotlight on labeling and annotation startups, which play a vital role in the training of modern AI models.

Labeling and annotation platforms are often overlooked, but they are essential for the development of AI. These platforms help in labeling the data that many models train on, allowing them to understand and interpret data during the training process. For example, labels for image recognition models may take the form of bounding boxes or captions around objects, places, or people in an image.

The accuracy and quality of labels have a significant impact on the performance and reliability of the trained models. Annotation is a massive undertaking that requires thousands to millions of labels for larger and more sophisticated data sets.

However, the treatment of data annotators is often poor, with many being paid low wages and denied basic benefits. An excellent piece in NY Mag highlights the challenges faced by Scale AI, which recruits annotators in countries such as Nairobi and Kenya. The platform pays as little as $10 per hour and requires workers to complete multiple eight-hour workdays with no breaks.

The need to annotate and label data for AI training is not going away. While self-regulation by the platforms is a possibility, policymaking may be the only viable solution to improving the working conditions of data annotators. Policymaking is a complex task, but it is necessary to ensure that the ethical labeling of data is a priority.

Aside from labeling and annotation, there are other AI stories worth noting. For example, SEEDS, a new system developed by MetNet-3 and GraphCast teams, uses diffusion to generate ensembles of plausible weather outcomes for an area. This technology is more efficient than physics-based models and can cover more edge cases.

Fujitsu is also making strides in better understanding the natural world by applying AI image handling techniques to underwater imagery and lidar data collected by underwater autonomous vehicles. This technology can help build a ""digital twin"" of waters that can simulate and predict new developments.

Finally, researchers have found that linear functions can mimic intelligence in LLMs, even though these models are complex and hard to understand. This discovery highlights the simplicity of some mechanisms working within these models. However, these models can still fail if they do not understand context or feedback.

In conclusion, labeling and annotation startups play a vital role in the development of modern AI models. While these platforms are often overlooked, they are essential for the accuracy and reliability of the trained models. Policymaking is necessary to ensure that the ethical labeling of data is a priority. Aside from labeling and annotation, there are other AI stories worth noting, such as SEEDS and Fujitsu's technology for understanding the natural world. With these developments, the future of AI is promising, and we can expect to see many more exciting advancements in the days to come.

This change is a response to changing market dynamics, including the reality of a multi-cloud world, a stricter regulatory environment, and consumer backlash. These companies are beginning to see the error in their ways by easing these fees, albeit with some caveats and friction involved.

The change of heart is an acknowledgement of changing market dynamics, says John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director at Synergy Research, a firm that tracks the cloud infrastructure market. “I think this is a natural progression of the market. As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist,” Dinsdale told TechCrunch.

The shift is partly due to regulatory pressure, but it’s also about the optics of preemptively making a language switch and how Google has used it as a marketing tool against Azure, says Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures. “Metaphorically, the market dynamic is moving away from the stick and back towards the carrot. Cloud customers looking to switch providers will need to be retained through innovative and accessible features now that the punishment of egress fees is being phased out,” Seseri said.

David Linthicum, a longtime cloud consultant, warns that while these recent announcements are a pleasant PR move, customers have to consider the costs holistically. He advises reviewing bills carefully because egress fees aren’t the only problem. “In other words, what are we paying for the services we’re leveraging? What are we paying for the networking fees, the egress fees, all the other hidden fees that come along with what people call junk fees that come from the cloud vendors?”

The experience of startups will certainly improve as providers now must lean further into innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty. However, larger enterprise customers may face more moving parts in a cloud ecosystem than just storage, such as services required for scaling and security.

Graham, whose primary business is helping move data, sees his whole business model affected by these fees. He says the recent changes are a small but important step, but he also sees a future where it’s increasingly difficult to determine what is an egress fee and what’s not, which could lead to the ultimate demise of these fees. That’s because migrations take a long time and the original cloud vendor is working hard to get the customer to change their minds and come back.

The shift towards a more open and less restrictive cloud environment is a positive development for customers looking to switch providers. It’s important to carefully review bills and consider the costs holistically when choosing a cloud provider. However, the experience of startups will certainly improve, and larger enterprise customers will need to adapt to a more complex cloud ecosystem.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738",2024-03-31 16:00:41,"Looking to switch cloud providers?

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/women-in-ai-brandie-nonnecke-of-uc-berkeley-says-investors-should-insist-on-responsible-ai-practices/,Women in AI: Brandie Nonnecke of UC Berkeley says investors should insist on responsible AI practices, Brandie Nonnecke on Responsible AI Development and Governance. ,"The Rise of AI: A Journey Through the Successes and Challenges

As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a vital area of focus. AI is the ability of a machine to mimic or replicate human intelligence, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. But with great power comes great responsibility, and as we continue to advance this technology, we must also ensure that it is developed in a responsible and ethical manner.

One of the key figures driving the responsible development of AI is Brandie Nonnecke. Nonnecke is the founding director of the CITRIS Policy Lab at UC Berkeley, where she supports interdisciplinary research to address questions around the role of regulation in promoting innovation. She is also the co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, where she leads projects on AI, platforms and society, and the UC Berkeley AI Policy Hub, an initiative to train researchers to develop effective AI governance and policy frameworks.

Nonnecke's work in responsible AI governance began nearly a decade ago, driven by her training in technology, public policy, and their intersection with societal impacts. She is passionate about using her skills to meaningfully contribute to society's ability to harness AI for good rather than standing on the sidelines.

One of Nonnecke's proudest accomplishments is the establishment of responsible AI principles and a governance structure at the University of California, which was the first university to do so. She also co-chaired the UC Presidential Working Group on AI and its subsequent permanent AI Council, where she gained firsthand experience thinking through how to best operationalize responsible AI principles in order to safeguard the university's faculty, staff, students, and the broader communities it serves.

Another area of focus for Nonnecke is public understanding of emerging technologies and their real benefits and risks. She launched TecHype, a video and podcast series that demystifies emerging technologies and provides guidance on effective technical and policy interventions.

 Navigating the Challenges of the Male-Dominated Tech Industry

As a woman in a male-dominated field like tech, Nonnecke has faced her share of challenges. However, she has found success by being curious, persistent, and undeterred by imposter syndrome. She has also sought out mentors who support diversity and inclusion and offered the same support to others entering the field. Building inclusive communities in tech has been a powerful way to share experiences, advice, and encouragement.

Advice for Women Entering the AI Field

Nonnecke has some advice for women entering the AI field. She encourages them to seek knowledge relentlessly, embrace networking, and advocate for themselves and others. She reminds them that their unique perspectives and experiences enrich the field and drive innovation.

Pressing Issues Facing AI

The development of AI presents several pressing issues that must be addressed in order to ensure its responsible and ethical use. One of the most pressing issues is to not get hung up on the latest hype cycles. While new technologies like generative AI present significant advancements, we must also focus on how and where machine learning is being applied regardless of its technological prowess.

Another issue that AI users should be aware of is data privacy and security, as well as potential bias in AI decision-making. It is important for users to understand these issues in order to demand more accountable and equitable AI systems.

Responsible AI Development

Responsible AI development involves integrating ethical considerations at every stage of development and deployment. This includes diverse stakeholder engagement, transparent methodologies, bias management strategies, and ongoing impact assessments. Prioritizing the public good and ensuring AI technologies are developed with human rights, fairness, and inclusivity at their core are fundamental.

Investors can also play a role in pushing for responsible AI by demanding transparency and accountability from companies developing AI technologies. They can also support initiatives and organizations that prioritize responsible AI development and governance.

Conclusion

The development of AI presents both opportunities and challenges, and it is up to us to ensure that it is developed in a responsible and ethical manner. Brandie Nonnecke is a shining example of a leader who is committed to this cause, and we can all learn from her insights and experiences. By working together to promote responsible AI development and governance, we can ensure that this technology is used to benefit society as a whole.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/women-in-ai-nonnecke.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-31 15:00:48,"Brandie Nonnecke is a leader in responsible AI governance, advocating for interdisciplinary research and ethically responsible development of AI.

The encryption of the passcodes is easy to decipher, and AT&T has initiated a robust investigation to determine the source of the leak. The data set, which contains personal information such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, has affected approximately 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and 65.4 million former account holders. While there is no evidence of unauthorized access to AT&T's systems resulting in the exfiltration of the data set, it is not yet known whether the data in those fields originated from AT&T or one of its vendors.

The data includes AT&T customer names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. A security researcher who analyzed the leaked data found that each record in the leaked data also contains the AT&T customer's account passcode in an encrypted format. The researcher was able to reverse-engineer which encrypted values matched which plaintext passcode by correlating encrypted account passcodes to surrounding account data such as customer dates of birth, house numbers, and partial Social Security numbers and phone numbers. The insufficient randomness of the encrypted data means it is possible to guess the customer's four-digit account passcode based on surrounding information in the leaked data set.

The data breach is the first time that AT&T has acknowledged that the leaked data belongs to its customers, despite denying a breach of its systems in 2019. In 2021, a hacker claiming the AT&T breach posted only a small sample of records, making it difficult to check if the data was authentic. Earlier in March, a data seller published the full 73 million alleged AT&T records online on a known cybercrime forum, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the leaked records. AT&T customers have since confirmed that their leaked account data is accurate.

AT&T said it will contact all of the 7.6 million existing customers whose passcodes it reset, as well as current and former customers whose personal information was compromised. The company has also provided a post on what customers can do to keep","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/att-store-nyc-times-square-breach.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 14:10:39,their personal information protected and has announced that it will be offering free identity theft protection services to affected customers.,Keyphrase: AT&T data breach,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-optimization-based-method-autonomous.html,An optimization-based method to enhance autonomous parking,Optimized Autonomous Parking: OCEAN Planner by Mach Drive,"Title: The Revolutionary OCEAN Planner for Autonomous Parking

Introduction:

Autonomous vehicles have been a long-standing goal of both robotics research and the automotive industry. While several companies have been investing in these vehicles and testing them, they have been deployed in a limited number of settings. Recently, researchers have explored the possibility of ""automated valet parking"" (AVP), a function that would allow a car to drive itself from the entrance of a parking to a free parking spot. However, the realization of this autonomous driving application has proved challenging.

Body:

Recently, researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai have developed OCEAN, an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner for the autonomous parking of vehicles. This planner, introduced in a paper pre-published on arXiv, was found to significantly enhance the ability of cars to safely reach a parking spot, without colliding with objects on the way.

""We propose an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner (OCEAN) for autonomous parking,"" Dongxu Wang, Yanbin Lu, and their collaborators wrote in their paper. ""OCEAN is an optimization-based trajectory planner accelerated by Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) with enhanced computational efficiency and robustness, and is suitable for all scenes with few dynamic obstacles.""

The new planner developed by the researchers was designed to overcome the two primary shortcomings of approaches presented in previous studies tackling autonomous parking. The first of these is the inability to accurately predict collisions, while the second entails poor performance in real-time tests.

The OCEAN planner builds on a previously introduced approach called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA), addressing its primary limitations. Its improved design ultimately improves its ability to avoid collisions, along with its robustness and speed in real time.

""Starting from a hierarchical optimization-based collision avoidance framework, the trajectory planning problem is first warm-started by a collision-free Hybrid A trajectory,"" Wang, Lu, and their collaborators wrote in their paper.

""Then the collision avoidance trajectory planning problem is reformulated as a smooth and convex dual form and solved by ADMM in",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/an-optimization-based.jpg,2024-03-30 09:00:01,"""The OCEAN planner for autonomous parking is a revolutionary approach that addresses the two primary shortcomings of previous studies on this topic.
