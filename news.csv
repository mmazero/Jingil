https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080, Alarming Climate Impact on Outdoor Days ,"The Earth's climate is a complex concept that can be challenging to relate to. However, a tool developed by MIT researchers may help make it more tangible. The tool allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 based on carbon emissions growth.

The results of the study can be both alarming and comforting, depending on where you live. Some regions, such as California, France, and Germany, will experience a slightly more hospitable climate, with a few to nearly a month of added outdoor days compared to historical records. However, other regions, such as New York and Massachusetts, will lose a week or more of outdoor days.

In addition to the impact on outdoor activities, the study also highlights the vulnerability of countries with large populations. For example, Nigeria's summers will grow even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India will lose almost two and a half months.

While it may seem difficult to reduce carbon emissions, it is possible to make progress. Even if the world fails to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but still manages to by 2070, the situation will improve dramatically. For instance, Nigeria and India will only lose one month of outdoor days, and more northerly regions will retain some of their added outdoor days.

The MIT tool is just one example of how climate scenario analysis can help us understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. Other startups are using this predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future.

One such startup, ClimateAI, is targeting agriculture, including agribusiness, lenders, and food and beverage companies. Climate scenario analysis is a key feature of ClimateAI's forecasts, and the startup provides other weather and climate-related data, too. Water risk assessment is also a key feature of ClimateAI's forecasts, as droughts, floods, and storms can decimate crops.

Sensible Weather is another startup that is working on markets that are closer to home for most of us. The company provides insurance for people embarking on outdoor events and activities, such as live concerts, camping, and golfing. Sensible Weather works with campgrounds, golf courses, live event operators, and more, allowing them to give customers an","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,Meta Description under 20 word: Mitigate the impact of climate change on outdoor activities by 2070.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork"," Valkey Redis Fork Backed by AWS, Google, Oracle, and More","Valkey, a new fork of Redis, was announced last week by the Linux Foundation. The project is backed by several major cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, and aims to maintain the open-source nature of Redis while addressing licensing issues. This move comes after Redis Labs switched from the permissive 3-clause BSD license to the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL) on March 20, making it incompatible with the standard definition of “open source.”

Redis has a rich history and has been among the most popular data stores in recent years. The project was launched by Salvatore Sanfilippo in 2009 under the BSD license, which allowed for commercial forks. However, Redis quickly gained popularity, and in 2013, Garantia, the first major Redis service provider, rebranded to RedisDB. Sanfilippo and the community pushed back, and after some time, Garantia eventually changed its name to Redis Labs and then to Redis in 2021.

In 2021, Redis Labs changed the licensing of its Redis Modules, which included visualization tools, a client SDK, and more. The modules were initially licensed under the Apache License with the added Commons Clause, which restricted others from selling and hosting these modules. However, Redis maintained that the license for open-source Redis remained BSD and would always remain BSD. That commitment lasted until a few weeks ago when Redis Labs switched to the SSPL.

Redis Labs CEO Rowan Trollope reiterated that the changes were necessary to allow commercial agreements with cloud vendors and that the major cloud service providers were launching a fork within a foundation. He emphasized that the large cloud vendors profited from the open-source version of Redis and were free to enter a commercial agreement with Redis Inc.

The Valkey community originated at AWS, where longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson initially started the project in her own GitHub account. The project quickly gained support from several other Redis maintainers, and the original Redis private channel included five maintainers, three from Redis, Olson, and Alibaba’s Zhao Zhao. The maintainers from Redis did not sign on, but","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"Optimized Meta Description:

Here's the revised version:

Iron Sheepdog, a Williamsburg, Virginia-based software company, aims to simplify and streamline the short-haul trucking industry by providing a platform for contractors to manage and track their trucks in real-time. The company has secured a $10 million Series B round of funding, led by SJF Ventures, with participation from Grand Ventures, Supply Chain Ventures, and strategic partners.

Iron Sheepdog's software is designed to make the short-haul trucking process more efficient for both contractors and truckers. Contractors can track their contracted trucks through the platform, giving them more transparency into where trucks are, how long a job takes, and how much to pay. The truckers themselves get an easy-to-use app that helps them accept jobs and get paid online.

The company's approach to building software has been different from its competitors. Instead of focusing on contractors to drive adoption, Iron Sheepdog started with the short-haul truck drivers themselves. The company made a simple app for the subhauler, tied it to 24-hour pay, and ensured that it was easy to use.

Iron Sheepdog's focus on adoption has been key to its success. The company's growth has doubled each year since it was founded, and it now has a substantial number of brokers and truckers on the platform. This enables companies to better utilize these resources, reducing the number of trucks needed and cutting emissions.

The investment in construction tech startups has grown in recent years, but this part of the system has not seen the same attention. Innovation around trucking has largely overlooked this area, and Iron Sheepdog is one of the few, if not the only, venture-backed startups tackling this problem.

Iron Sheepdog's focus on adoption is also noteworthy. While it seems obvious that companies should build products that the organizations they are targeting will actually use, this does not always happen, and there are many industries that remain behind technology-wise as a result.

There is nothing good about new tech if no one is using it.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ISD_broker-truck.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 16:00:39,"Iron Sheepdog aims to revolutionize the short-haul trucking industry with real-time trucking management software.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-fabricating-high-density-vertical.html,A new strategy for fabricating high-density vertical organic electrochemical transistor arrays, Vertical OECT Arrays with Excellent Performance and Stability ,"In the realm of electronics, emerging technologies are constantly pushing boundaries and paving the way for new possibilities. Among these, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have gained traction due to their unique properties and potential applications in brain-inspired, wearable, and neuromorphic systems. While conventional OECTs have exhibited limitations such as limited stability and slow redox processes, researchers at Northwestern University have recently proposed a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs. Their work, published in Nature Electronics, showcases the potential of this approach and could significantly impact the field of OECTs.

Organic semiconductors have long been recognized for their versatility and potential in various electronic applications. However, their use in monolithically integrated circuits has been restricted due to micro- and nanopatterning limitations and topological irregularities. The researchers at Northwestern University have addressed these challenges by using electron beam lithography (eBL) to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits.

eBL allows for the direct exposure of both p- and n-channel organic semiconductor films to a direct beam of electrons, resulting in highly defined, conducting channel regions with excellent operational stability. Moreover, this approach enables the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits. The resulting p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays exhibit transconductances of 0.08-1.7 S, transient times of less than 100 µs, and stable switching properties of more than 100,000 cycles.

To further demonstrate the potential of their fabrication strategy, the researchers successfully used it to create various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These circuits performed remarkably well while maintaining excellent operational stability.

This recent study highlights the potential of e-beam exposure as a scalable fabrication approach for OECTs. As a result, it could significantly impact the field by facilitating the integration of OECTs into electronic devices. Future studies could build upon this work to further enhance the stability and performance of OECT circuits, paving the way for their widespread adoption in various applications.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/women-in-ai-kate-devlin-of-kings-college-is-researching-ai-and-intimacy/,Women in AI: Kate Devlin of King's College is researching AI and intimacy, This tech giant's new AI assistant is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines. ,"Introducing the AI Revolution: Interviewing Remarkable Women who are Changing the Landscape

AI is transforming the world around us, and women are playing a vital role in shaping the future of this exciting technology. To highlight the contributions of these women, TechCrunch is launching a series of interviews featuring remarkable individuals who are making a difference in the field.

Kate Devlin is one such woman. As a lecturer in AI and society at King’s College London, Devlin’s research explores how people interact with and react to AI technologies, both past and present. Devlin is also a board member of the Open Rights Group and the director of advocacy and engagement for the Trusted Autonomous Systems Hub.

In this interview, Devlin talks about her background in AI, the most pressing issues facing the field, and advice for women seeking to enter the field. She also discusses the challenges of navigating the male-dominated tech industry and the importance of responsibility and accountability in AI development.

Q&A with Kate Devlin

Q: How did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?

Devlin: I started off as an archaeologist, eventually moving across disciplines and completing a Ph.D. in computer science in 2004. The idea was to integrate the subjects, but I ended up doing more and more on human-computer interaction, and on how people interact with AI and robots, including the reception that such technologies have.

Q: What work are you most proud of (in the AI field)?

Devlin: I’m pleased that intimacy and AI is now taken seriously as an academic area of study. There’s some amazing research going on. It used to be viewed as very niche and highly unlikely; now we’re seeing people forming meaningful relationships with chatbots — meaningful in that they really do mean something to those people.

Q: How do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry, and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?

Devlin: I don’t. We just persevere. It’s still shockingly sexist. And maybe I don’t want to “lean in”; maybe I want an environment that isn’t defined around macho qualities. I guess it’s a two-pronged thing: we need more women in visible, top positions, and we need to tackle sexism in schools and beyond. And then we need a systemic change to stop the “leaky pipeline” — we’re seeing an increase of women in AI and tech due to a rise in home working as it fits better with childcare which, let’s face it, still falls to us. Let’s have more flexibility until we don’t have to do the majority of that caring on our own.

Q: What advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field?

Devlin: You have the right to take up as much space as the men.

Q: What are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?

Devlin: Responsibility. Accountability. There’s currently a fever pitch that hinges around technological determinism — as if we’re hurtling toward some dangerous future. We don’t have to be. It’s possible to reject that. It’s fine to prioritize a different path. Very few of the issues we face are new; it’s size and scale that are making this particularly tricky.

Q: What are some issues AI users should be aware of?

Devlin: Uh… late-stage capitalism.

More usefully: check provenance — where’s the data coming from? How ethical is the provider? Do they have a good track record of social responsibility? Would you let them control your oxygen supply on Mars?

Q: What is the best way to responsibly build AI?

Devlin: Regulation and conscience.

Q: How can investors better push for responsible AI?

Devlin: Thinking of this in purely business terms, you’ll have much happier customers if you care about people. We can see through ethics-washing so really make it matter. Hold the companies responsible for considering things like human rights, labor, sustainability, and social impact in their AI supply chain.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/women-in-ai-devlin.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-30 15:00:56,"Discover the transformative impact of AI on the world as we interview remarkable women shaping the future.

Autonomous vehicles have been a long-standing goal for both the robotics research and automotive industries. While various companies have invested in these vehicles and tested them, they have only been deployed in limited settings. In recent years, researchers have been exploring the possibility of automated valet parking (AVP), a function that would allow a car to drive itself from the entrance of a parking lot to a free parking spot. However, the reliable realization of this autonomous driving application has proven challenging.

Recently, researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai developed OCEAN, an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner for the autonomous parking of vehicles. This planner, introduced in a pre-published paper on arXiv, was found to significantly enhance the ability of cars to safely reach a parking spot without colliding with objects on the way.

The new planner developed by the researchers aimed to overcome the two primary shortcomings of approaches presented in previous studies tackling autonomous parking. The first of these is the inability to accurately predict collisions, while the second entails poor performance in real-time tests.

The OCEAN planner builds on a previously introduced approach called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA), addressing its primary limitations. Its improved design ultimately improves its ability to avoid collisions, along with its robustness and speed in real time.

The planner was tested on hundreds of simulated scenarios and conducted real-world experiments in public parking areas. The results were highly promising, as OCEAN was found to outperform a variety of methods for autonomous parking applications.

The proposed method has better system performance compared with other benchmarks. The method makes it possible to deploy large-scale parking planners on low computing power platforms that require real-time performance.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-gmail-revolutionized-email-years-people.html,Gmail revolutionized email 20 years ago. People thought it was Google's April Fool's Day joke,Gmail: 20 Years of Revolutionizing Email Communication,"

April 1st, 2004: The Unveiling of Gmail - A Game-Changing Email Service

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin loved to pull pranks, so much so that they began rolling outlandish ideas every April Fool's Day. That's why when they unveiled Gmail, a free email service with 1 gigabyte of storage per account, it was no exception. The idea of having so much email storage space was considered preposterous in an age of one-terabyte iPhones, yet Gmail offered 250 to 500 times more email storage space.

But it wasn't just the storage that made Gmail stand out. The service also came with Google's search technology, allowing users to quickly retrieve old emails, photos, and personal information. Gmail also automatically threaded together a string of communications about the same topic, making it easier for users to follow conversations.

The original pitch for Gmail focused on three main aspects - storage, search, and speed. The service was designed to change people's perceptions about what was possible within a web browser. It was such a mind-bending concept that when The Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on April Fool's Day 2004, readers called and emailed to inform the news agency that they had been duped by Google's pranksters.

However, the AP knew that Gmail wasn't a prank because an AP reporter had been abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make the trip worthwhile. After arriving at the still-developing corporate campus, the AP reporter was ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while sitting in front of his laptop computer.

Page, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail's sleekly designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within Microsoft's now-retired Explorer web browser. He also pointed out that there was no delete button featured in the main control window because it wouldn't be necessary, given Gmail had so much storage and could be easily searched. ""I think people are really going to like this,"" Page predicted.

As with so many other things, Page was right. Today, Gmail has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts, each one now offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. Even though that's 15 times more storage than Gmail initially offered, it's still not enough for many users who rarely see the need to purge their accounts, just as Google hoped.

The digital hoarding of email, photos, and other content is why Google, Apple, and other companies now make money from selling additional storage capacity in their data centers. In Google's case, it charges anywhere from $30 annually for 200 gigabytes of storage to $250 annually for 5 terabytes of storage. Gmail's existence has revolutionized email communication, making it faster, more efficient, and more convenient.

The digital age has transformed the way we communicate, and Gmail has played a significant role in that transformation. As we continue to rely more on technology, Gmail's impact will only continue to grow. The service's success is a testament to the power of innovation and the ability to adapt to the changing needs of users.

In conclusion, Gmail's unveiling on April Fool's Day 2004 was a game-changer in the world of email communication. With its sleek design, powerful search functionality, and vast storage capacity, Gmail has transformed the way we communicate and store our digital information. The service's impact will only continue to grow as we continue to rely more on technology, and its success is a testament to the power of innovation and the ability to adapt to the changing needs of users.

Welcome to this week's edition of TechCrunch's Week in Review (WiR), where we round up the most notable happenings in the tech world.

First off, let's dive into the world of electric vehicles (EVs). Fisker, an EV startup, recently faced some financial hiccups. According to Sean O'Kane's report, the company briefly lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that took months to complete. This incident raises concerns about the financial stability of EV startups and their ability to manage customer payments.

Another big story this week involves Facebook's internal snooping on users' Snapchat traffic. Lorenzo reported that the social media giant conducted a secret project known internally at Meta as ""Project Ghostbusters."" The goal was to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat's app and its servers. This revelation raises questions about Facebook's data collection practices and its respect for user privacy.

Manish also covered the resignation of Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque. Mostaque's departure from the company comes amid an ongoing struggle for stability at Stability AI, which was reportedly spending ~$8 million a month as of October 2023 with little revenue to show for it.

Moving on to other news, Fisker's stock trading was halted by the New York Stock Exchange, citing its ""abnormally low"" stock levels. Meanwhile, Google added the ability for users to ask its Search engine to plan a travel itinerary, using AI to draw on ideas from websites around the web along with reviews, photos, and other details.

Robinhood also launched its new Gold Card, powered by X1's technology, with a list of features that could make Apple Card users envious. However, the personal information of some 73 million AT&T customers spilled online this week, and the company won't say how.

In terms of funding, Copilot, a budgeting app, raised $6 million in a Series A round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. The app is benefiting partly from the death of Mint, Intuit's financial management product.

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-has-reportedly-been-blocked-on-all-congress-owned-devices-034946166.html,Microsoft Copilot has reportedly been blocked on all Congress-owned devices, Microsoft Copilot Blocked on Congress-Owned Devices: Security Risk Concerns ,"The US Congress has recently prohibited the use of Microsoft's Copilot on government-issued devices. This decision was made by House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor, who deemed the AI chatbot to be a security risk. The Office of Cybersecurity has expressed concern that Copilot could leak House data to non-House approved cloud services. While there is no ban on the use of Copilot on personal devices, it has been prohibited on all Windows devices owned by Congress.

This move comes almost a year after the Congress banned staffers from using ChatGPT's free version on House computers. However, they were allowed to continue using the paid version for research and evaluation due to its tighter privacy controls. The White House also recently revealed rules federal agencies have to follow when using generative AI, which would ensure that any tool they use does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans.

Microsoft has recognized the need for higher security requirements in government use and has announced a roadmap of tools and services meant for this purpose. The company has also launched an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant. All these tools and services will feature higher levels of security to make them suitable for handling sensitive data.

Szpindor's office will evaluate the Copilot version for government use when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. While this decision may be controversial, it is necessary to ensure the security of sensitive government data.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"""Microsoft's Copilot Chatbot Blocked on Government-Issued Devices: House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor has banned Copilot on government-issued devices due to security concerns.
