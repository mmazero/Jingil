This SEO title highlights the key point of the law being passed in Colorado to protect neural data, emphasizing user privacy and resonating with the topic's urgency in the digital age.","

Are You Ready to Give Away Your Brainwaves?

In today's digital age, we're used to sharing our personal information online, from our fingerprints to our facial images. But with the rise of neurotech wearables, we're now being asked to share our brainwaves too.

On Wednesday, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed a bill expanding the state's existing privacy law to include neural data, or brain activity, under the umbrella of biological data. This includes recordings of our fingerprints, face, and DNA, as well as our brainwaves. Prior to the bill, only fingerprints and facial images were protected in Colorado.

Neurotech wearables use electroencephalography (EEG), a method of measuring brain activity using electrodes. Invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), like Neuralink or Synchron, are implanted in the body and are regulated under higher data protections. However, non-invasive neurotech, like wearables that use EEG, are considered consumer devices and aren't yet regulated.

Consumer products that incorporate EEG have been around for a while, including companies like Emotiv and NeuroSky that have explored the technology for fitness, digital health, and even perfume. Meta, Apple, and Snap are also working on their own devices.

Plenty of unregulated neurotech wearables are now available, from headsets promising better athletic performance to headbands that help you meditate. These devices track, analyze, and, in some cases, record your brain activity.

The Colorado legislation was passed in response to growing concerns about privacy in consumer BCIs. ""Data concerning the activity of the human brain and wider nervous systems, or ""neural data"", is extremely sensitive and can reveal intimate information about individuals, including information about health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive functioning,"" the bill states.

In the wrong hands, that data could be used against individuals by companies or third parties. A report from The Neurorights Foundation found that 29 out of 30 companies surveyed ""appear to have access to the consumer's neural data and provide no meaningful limitations to this access.""

The report also mentions several recent studies that contribute to the ""growing scientific consensus that neural data collected by non-invasive devices can indeed decode human thought,"" a privacy weakness if left unprotected.

As artificial intelligence (AI) - which famously needs lots of data to train on - has exploded into the mainstream over the last two years, general concerns over the collection and sale of user data have, too. AI in the tech industry is still relatively unregulated, and the US has lagged behind Europe in terms of data privacy legislation.

Colorado's move is a small but notable step in the right direction. California and Minnesota are making similar progress, but no policy on neural data exists yet at the federal level.

So, are you ready to give away your brainwaves? It's up to you to decide whether the benefits of neurotech wearables outweigh the potential risks to your privacy.

A recent law passed in Colorado expands the state's existing privacy law to include neural data, or brain activity, under the umbrella of biological data. This law is a small but notable step in the right direction, as the collection and sale of user data, particularly neural data, has become a growing concern with the rise of AI.

The new law, known as the Neural Data Protection Law, aims to protect individuals' neural data from being accessed or used by companies or third parties without their consent. Non-invasive neurotech wearables, such as headsets and headbands that use electroencephalography (EEG) to track brain activity, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, these devices have raised concerns about privacy, as they can record and analyze intimate information about individuals, including their health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive functioning.

The Neural Data Protection Law is a response to these concerns and aims to protect individuals' neural data by regulating non-invasive neurotech wearables. The law states that data concerning the activity of the human brain and wider nervous systems is extremely sensitive and can reveal intimate information about individuals. Plenty of unregulated neurotech wearables are now available, and in the wrong hands, that data could be used against individuals.

The Neural Data Protection Law is a significant step towards protecting individuals' privacy rights in the digital age. The law ensures that individuals have control over their neural data and that companies cannot access or use that data without their consent. This is particularly important as AI continues to explode into the mainstream and the collection and sale of user data, including neural data, becomes increasingly common.

In conclusion, the Neural Data Protection Law is a crucial step towards protecting individuals' privacy rights in the digital age. With the rise of neurotech wearables and AI, it is more important than ever to ensure that individuals' neural data is protected from being accessed or used by companies or third parties without their consent.

In our rapidly evolving world, electronic devices are becoming increasingly complex to accommodate a multitude of functions. From personal devices like smartphones, tablets, and watches to industrial machines, the growing intricacy can lead to performance and safety issues such as overheating and microwave emissions. These problems can not only affect a device's performance but also pose health risks and interfere with other devices.

To tackle these challenges, a team of Chinese researchers from Beijing Normal University and the University of Science and Technology Beijing has developed a groundbreaking solution. They created shielding for electronic devices using multifunctional composite phase change materials (PCMs) to enhance thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption.

PCMs are engineered materials that combine various elements to achieve specific characteristics. In this study, the researchers aimed to improve thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption in electronic devices. To do so, they drew inspiration from biological systems and built a neural network-like aerogel to increase the efficiency of thermal management and microwave emission absorption.

Xiao Chen, a researcher from the Institute of Advanced Materials at Beijing Normal University, explained, ""Our developed functionally integrated composite PCMs provide a prospective application of highly integrated and miniaturized electronic devices in complex and changeable outdoor environments.""

The researchers carefully selected the elements for their new aerogel shield, focusing on improved thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption. They chose PCMs with excellent heat storage capabilities, bacterial cellulose for solar-thermal conversion, and metal-organic frameworks for microwave absorption. The final material was encased in paraffin wax for thermal storage.

The composite hybrid aerogel was then tested for its solar-thermal conversion, thermal storage capacity, and microwave absorption capabilities. The results showed that the aerogel-based composite PCMs absorbed over 90% of broadband and full light spectrum for solar-thermal conversion, converting solar energy into thermal energy with over 95% efficiency. The thermal storage capacity was measured at 122.19 J/g. Furthermore, the incident electromagnetic waves were efficiently absorbed by the aerogel-based composite PCMs.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University are paving the way for a new era of immersive displays, combining the real and virtual worlds in a pair of everyday eyeglasses using high-definition 3D holographic images. This development introduces a virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) display that could potentially offer a truly immersive experience, allowing users to move their heads freely without losing sight of the holographic images.

Holographic images possess a distinctive advantage over traditional monitors, as they have genuine depth, making them seamlessly integrable into our natural view of the real world. In contrast, conventional monitors merely simulate depth on a two-dimensional screen. The potential of holographic images to provide a more organic and immersive visual experience could revolutionize several aspects of our lives, from navigation and healthcare to home repairs and entertainment.

The primary challenge in holographic displays is ensuring high-quality images. Until now, spatial light modulators, the devices responsible for creating holographic images, have been limited by a tradeoff between image size and clarity, resulting in a narrow field of view. A narrow field of view hinders the potential for an immersive experience, as the image may disappear when looking towards the display's corners.

To tackle this challenge, Felix Heide, along with Nathan Matsuda and Ethan Tseng, developed a device that enhances image quality and expands the field of view. By combining a spatial light modulator with a custom-built optical element, the team successfully filtered light to expand the display's field of view while preserving image stability and fidelity. This innovative approach creates a larger image with minimal quality reduction, bringing us one step closer to practical holographic displays.

The new optical element, likened to a tiny piece of frosted glass, scatters light in a precise manner, pushing certain image elements into frequency bands less perceptible to the human eye. This unique scattering pattern significantly improves holographic image quality and expands the field of view.

Despite the progress made, several hurdles must be overcome to create a fully functional holographic display.

Introduction

In an era where circular resources are becoming increasingly vital, a South Korean research team has made significant strides in selectively recovering high-purity gold from electronic waste. This innovative technology, developed by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi and his team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), uses textile materials to recover gold efficiently. This article will delve into the details of this groundbreaking research, highlighting its implications and potential applications in the global circular economy.

The Challenge of Metal Recovery from Electronic Waste

Traditional adsorbents for metal recovery are typically granular, offering high specific surface areas that enhance adsorption efficiency. However, they present several challenges, such as difficulty in controlling underwater, low recovery rates, and potential environmental pollution. Fiber-like materials, on the other hand, offer advantages in terms of underwater control and adaptability to various shapes through weaving processes. Yet, their thinness and low strength make them prone to breaking during gold recovery applications.

The KIST Team's Solution: Alkaline Polymer Fiber (ALPF)

To overcome these challenges, the KIST research team, led by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi, chemically immobilized alkaline molecules on the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers. This method improved both the molecular gold recovery performance and structural stability of the fiber-like materials. The amine-containing polymer fiber boasts a significantly larger surface area, enhancing gold ion (Au) adsorption performance by up to 2.5 times compared to the team's previously developed granular gold adsorption material.

Impressive Results and Applications

The research demonstrates impressive results, with the ALPF showing remarkable Au recovery performance under various conditions. The FESEM images of the ALPF surface after Au recovery reveal the presence of Au(0) particles, while XRD patterns confirm the successful recovery of gold. Furthermore, FESEM-EDS mapping illustrates the distribution of chemical elements on the ALPF after Au recovery.

The ALPF adsorbent also exhibits excellent adsorption selectivity for Au(III) in the presence of coexisting metal ions, showcasing its",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/extracting-high-purity.jpg,2024-04-23 10:28:43,"Groundbreaking textile-based gold recovery technology improves efficiency by 1.5x.

","Title: The Power of Small: Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini Language Model

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, tech companies are in a race to create increasingly large and sophisticated models. However, Microsoft is taking a different approach by focusing on the potential of smaller models. The tech giant has recently unveiled Phi-3 Mini, the first in a series of three compact AI models, and the smallest of the trio.

Phi-3 Mini was trained on 3.8 billion parameters or variables, which enable AI models to provide more accurate and efficient results. Microsoft has yet to announce the release dates for Phi-3 Small and Phi-3 Medium, which will be trained on 7 billion and 14 billion parameters, respectively.

For context, OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo is reported to have been trained on more than 1 trillion parameters, while Meta's final Llama 3 model, launching later in 2024, will have been trained on 700 billion parameters. While larger models can deliver better results for complex queries and critical AI implementations, they require more power and energy.

Smaller AI models, like those Microsoft is developing, are particularly beneficial for lower-powered devices, such as smartphones, where on-device AI performance is limited by chipset power and battery life. Microsoft plans to utilize Phi-3 in mobile devices, leveraging its compact size without compromising performance.

Despite its diminutive scale, the Phi-3 Mini model reportedly performs well. According to Microsoft, Phi-3 Mini offers the same capabilities as models trained on more than 10 times the number of parameters used by Microsoft. Although it cannot compete with GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo, it is as capable as GPT-3.5.

Microsoft achieved this performance by training Phi-3 Mini on a ""curriculum"" that included children's books. The company also employed a larger model to generate AI-created children's books, supplementing its real-world material.

Phi-3 Mini is now accessible for free on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, model collaboration site Hugging Face, and AI model service Ollama, further expanding its potential applications.
