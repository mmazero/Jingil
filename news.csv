Unlocking the Full Potential of Apple's Vision Pro with Splitscreen

Apple's Vision Pro has made waves in the tech world with its ability to transform into a 4K Mac virtual display, extending your desktop into the realm of spatial computing. Now, a groundbreaking new app called Splitscreen takes this experience to the next level, allowing you to effortlessly add a second macOS display to your Vision Pro, even if it's linked to a different Apple ID.

This app is a game-changer for multitaskers who juggle multiple Mac computers and seek a seamless way to utilize their Vision Pro's Mac Virtual Display. Whether you need one display for work and another for personal use, Splitscreen creates the illusion of a multi-monitor setup within the immersive VR/AR environment.

The brains behind Splitscreen, developer Jordi Bruin, acknowledges the challenges in achieving this feat. However, their innovative approach paves the way for future enhancements, including more displays, customizable settings, and improved stability. Bruin promises granular controls and a rock-solid connection in the pipeline.

The team behind Splitscreen is no stranger to groundbreaking apps. Mathijs Kadjik and Tom Lokhorst, the indie developers behind the iPhone-to-Mac mirroring app Bezel, joined forces with Bruin, known for his suite of iOS utilities and apps like Soosee and PosturePal. They've harnessed their collective expertise to bring Splitscreen to life.

Upon launch, Splitscreen automatically connects to the Vision Pro via the optimal network available. Recognizing that performance can vary depending on network conditions, the developers offer a generous 15-minute free session for you to test the app on your own setup. This session can be reset after each use, or you can unlock unlimited access with a one-time in-app purchase of $20 (until the end of March).

Currently, Splitscreen is exclusive to M1 Macs due to its reliance on the HEVC video codec for data transmission. However, an upcoming update promises support for Intel Macs, expanding its compatibility. Additionally, the app currently supports a single resolution (1920×1080), but the developers are actively working on adding more options and the ability to incorporate more than two displays.

Head over to the App Store to download Splitscreen for free and embark on a transformative multitasking journey with your Apple Vision Pro.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/lizcore/,Lizcore's sport tracking system is minimalist enough for indoor climbers to actually use,"

In the world of indoor climbing, Lizcore, a Barcelona-based startup, is making waves with its innovative approach to digitizing and enhancing the climbing experience. Their system seamlessly integrates hardware and software, allowing climbers to track their performance, engage in social gamification, and optimize their training without the hassle of carrying additional devices.

At the heart of Lizcore's system is the Lizy bracelet, a lightweight NFC wearable that pairs with the startup's app. Climbers simply tap the bracelet on the smart base unit at the start of a route, and the app records their attempts, logging sends, red points, and completion times. The system eliminates the need for climbers to carry smartphones or bulky smartwatches, ensuring an unhindered climbing experience.

Lizcore's technology also offers gyms valuable insights into climbing activity and usage patterns. The system provides data on quiet and busy times, route popularity, and member preferences, helping gyms optimize their operations and cater to their climbers' needs. The app also serves as a direct communication channel between gyms and their members, enabling targeted notifications about offers, promotions, and new route information.

The Lizcore system has the potential to revolutionize the indoor climbing experience, making it more engaging, social, and data-driven. With its climber-centric design and focus on enhancing the overall climbing experience, Lizcore is poised to make a significant impact on the climbing community.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/threads-widens-the-gap-with-x-with-triple-the-daily-downloads-on-ios/,"Threads widens the gap with X, with triple the daily downloads on iOS","

In the ongoing battle of social media platforms, Meta's Threads app has emerged as a formidable contender, overshadowing its rival X (formerly Twitter) in terms of daily downloads and user engagement. While Threads initially experienced fluctuations in its popularity, it has consistently outperformed X in recent months, signaling a potential shift in the microblogging landscape.

Meta's dominance in this space is evident in the sheer volume of downloads. On February 25, 2024, Threads garnered nearly triple the downloads of X on iOS and more than double on Google Play. This trend has persisted, with Threads maintaining a significant lead in daily installs.

Threads' success can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, it benefits from the vast user base of Instagram, its parent company. By showcasing popular Threads within the timelines of Facebook and Instagram, Meta has effectively cross-promoted the app and attracted new users. Additionally, Threads' focus on close friends and family resonates with users seeking a more private and intimate social media experience.

While X has a larger monthly active user base, the authenticity of these accounts is questionable. Reports have surfaced of a ""Verified bot problem,"" where automated accounts accidentally reveal their source by posting boilerplate responses that violate OpenAI's content policy. This raises concerns about the integrity of X's user base and the potential for misinformation and spam.

In contrast, Threads appears to have a more genuine and engaged user base. While it's not immune to bot issues, the platform seems to foster more organic interactions and authentic content sharing.

Meanwhile, decentralized X alternatives like Mastodon and Bluesky have yet to make a significant impact. Mastodon's third-party app ecosystem provides some diversity, but its overall user base remains relatively small. Bluesky, a newcomer to the scene, saw a brief surge in downloads upon its public launch, but its momentum has since waned.

As Threads continues to gain traction, it poses a serious challenge to X's dominance in the microblogging realm. Meta's editorial control over Threads could potentially influence the information-sharing ecosystem, raising concerns among journalists, researchers, and news consumers. However, Threads' focus on privacy and its growing popularity suggest that it may become the preferred platform for microblogging in the future.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/as-data-takes-center-stage-codified-wants-to-bring-more-automation-to-governance/,"As data takes center stage, Codified wants to bring flexibility to governance","

In the realm of enterprise software, data has surged in prominence over the past decade, and its significance has only intensified with the advent of large language models. However, this rise has been accompanied by a surge in regulations governing data usage, making compliance a critical and intricate challenge.

Enter Codified, an innovative startup founded by data veteran Yatharth Gupta. Recognizing the pivotal role of data in modern technology and the struggle companies face in controlling access to it, Gupta embarked on a mission to solve the data compliance conundrum. Today, Codified proudly announces its $4 million seed funding round.

Gupta observed that numerous large organizations author policies and attempt to implement them through various means. However, he identified a gap in software solutions that are sufficiently flexible for contemporary use cases, leaving companies vulnerable, particularly when policy adjustments are required.

Codified aims to transform this landscape by translating policies into code. This code can be implemented in diverse ways, seamlessly integrated with various applications seeking data access, and effortlessly modified to accommodate new customers or user categories.

""We empower your company's innovation by ensuring easy and compliant access to data within your organization,"" Gupta stated.

Codified's solution allows customers to establish conditions, such as mandatory security training within the past year or membership in a sensitive project team. This enables companies to define data access rules based on employee identity, applications used, and project involvement, eliminating reliance on group-based rules that often fail to keep pace with employee movement and job changes.

Gupta's extensive background in data-centric roles, including 15 years at Microsoft and a stint at Singlestor, fueled his passion for addressing the challenges he now tackles with Codified.

The product is currently under development, with Gupta collaborating with design partners to refine the concept. A team of five full-time employees and six contractors is dedicated to bringing the product to fruition, targeting a release candidate later this year.

Codified's seed funding round was backed by notable investors, including Vine Ventures, Soma Capital, and Madrona Venture Labs, where the startup was incubated last year.

PlayStation Cuts: A Strategic Restructuring for Long-Term Growth

In a significant move, Sony recently announced layoffs affecting approximately 900 employees within its PlayStation division. This decision, impacting 8% of the division's global workforce, reflects the company's commitment to long-term sustainability and delivering exceptional experiences to its gaming community.

PlayStation Chief Jim Ryan explained the rationale behind this strategic restructuring. He emphasized the need to adapt to evolving industry dynamics and ensure the company's continued growth and success. Ryan stressed the importance of taking a holistic view of the business and prioritizing the long-term viability of PlayStation.

The layoffs will affect various studios under the PlayStation umbrella, including Insomniac Games, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite. Head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst confirmed that the cuts would impact employees across the Americas, Japan, EMEA, and APAC regions. Unfortunately, some ongoing projects in various stages of development will be discontinued as a result of these changes.

This news comes shortly after Sony revised its sales forecast for the PlayStation 5, acknowledging a decrease in demand. The company now expects to sell 21 million units of the console in its fiscal year, down from its previous projection of 25 million.

Sony's decision to restructure its PlayStation division is not an isolated incident. The gaming industry has witnessed a wave of layoffs in recent months. Microsoft, Unity, Google, Snapchat, eBay, PayPal, DocuSign, Okta, Block, Discord, Twitch, and Duolingo are among the companies that have conducted sizable layoffs.

Despite the layoffs, Sony remains committed to delivering high-quality gaming experiences to its loyal fanbase. The company's focus on long-term sustainability and strategic restructuring is a testament to its dedication to maintaining its position as a leader in the gaming industry.

In a world where digital photography has become synonymous with instant gratification, Lapse, a novel smartphone app, is taking us back to the nostalgic charm of analog cameras. It offers a unique experience that harks back to the days when taking a picture was a deliberate act, and the anticipation of seeing the developed results was part of the thrill.

Lapse has garnered significant traction, boasting millions of users, capturing over 100 million photos monthly, and securing a coveted spot among the top 10 photographic apps in the U.S. app store. Now, with a fresh round of funding amounting to $30 million, Lapse is poised to elevate its ambitions.

The funding round was co-led by Greylock, a renowned consumer app investor with a track record of backing tech giants like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn, and DST Global Partners, another iconic investment firm. Previous supporters, including GV, Octopus Ventures, and Speedinvest, also participated in this funding round.

With this latest infusion of capital, Lapse's total funding has surpassed $42 million, propelling its valuation to an impressive $150 million. The company plans to utilize these funds to enhance the ""unedited"" photo experience, introduce new features that enrich the overall photography journey, and eventually venture into the realm of video.

While monetization is a potential avenue for the future, Lapse CEO and co-founder Dan Silvertown emphasizes their commitment to avoiding the traditional advertising-driven model that plagues many social media platforms. Instead, they aim to explore alternative revenue streams that align with their ethos of authenticity and user privacy.

Lapse's philosophy is rooted in the desire to recapture the simplicity and freedom of analog photography in the digital age. It was born from the longing for a camera that liberates users from the constant need to check likes and notifications, allowing them to focus on capturing genuine moments without the pressure of social validation.

Behind the scenes, Lapse employs a sophisticated processing pipeline that enhances the captured photos. This involves a series of steps, including computer vision algorithms and proprietary techniques, designed to optimize the composition and overall aesthetics of the images. However, it's important to note that editing and retaking photos are not permitted within the app, preserving the essence of the analog experience.

While Lapse's unique approach has garnered praise, it has also faced scrutiny for its initial growth tactics, which involved growth-hacking and forced invites. Silvertown acknowledges these missteps, emphasizing that the company has learned from them. He maintains that forced invites were a necessary measure to kickstart the platform, given its reliance on a critical mass of users for organic growth.

However, Lapse has since moved away from this practice, and Silvertown claims that the app has gained traction through word-of-mouth and its journaling features, which allow users to create private or shareable albums with select friends.

Despite these improvements, some users, particularly those wary of sharing personal data on social apps, may find it challenging to navigate Lapse's interface and avoid sharing their contacts. This friction could hinder the app's broader adoption.

In today's digital landscape, consumers are increasingly aware of the trade-offs involved in using popular social media platforms. They are yearning for simpler alternatives that prioritize genuine connections and authentic experiences. While some competitors in this space have faltered, Lapse remains optimistic about the potential for its unique take on social sharing.

Jacob Andreou, a general partner at Greylock, shares his perspective on the market opportunity: ""Many of the large-scale platforms started as places where we could keep up with our friends, but they've evolved into something else. There's a void for a platform that focuses solely on sharing with close friends, and Lapse has the potential to fill that gap.""

Lapse's journey is a testament to the enduring appeal of simplicity and authenticity in the digital age. As it continues to refine its platform and explore new avenues for growth, it will be fascinating to see how it navigates the challenges and seizes the opportunities that lie ahead.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/asymmetrical-financial-is-betting-big-on-the-bitcoin-defi-space-with-new-dedicated-fund/,Asymmetric Financial has a plan to unlock Bitcoin's trillion-dollar potential with dedicated DeFi fund,"

In the burgeoning world of digital assets, a new crypto fund, Asymmetric Financial, is setting its sights on the untapped potential of Bitcoin's DeFi space. Led by Dan Held, a seasoned Bitcoiner and former growth director at Kraken, the fund aims to raise $21 million to invest in startups pushing the boundaries of DeFi on the Bitcoin blockchain.

DeFi, short for decentralized finance, leverages blockchain technology to facilitate direct transactions between market participants and retail investors, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This opens up a world of possibilities, such as decentralized lending and borrowing platforms that offer access to capital without traditional credit checks.

Held, a staunch advocate for DeFi in the Bitcoin ecosystem, believes that Bitcoin's vast user base, liquidity, and value make it the ideal platform for DeFi innovation. He sees immense opportunities in layer-2 (L2) networks, which offer faster speeds and higher throughput than Bitcoin's base layer, and in meta-protocols like NFT-like Ordinals.

While the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem is still in its infancy, it has already shown signs of explosive growth. In the past 30 days alone, Bitcoin's blockchain recorded over $279 million in NFT sales volume, with Ordinals contributing a significant $54.7 million. This surge in activity suggests that Bitcoin's blockchain has the potential to become a major player in the NFT market.

Despite the excitement surrounding Bitcoin DeFi, Held acknowledges the challenges that developers face in building on the Bitcoin blockchain. The L2 infrastructure is still in its early stages, and the pool of developers focusing on the ecosystem is relatively small. However, he believes that the increased expressivity of L2s on Bitcoin makes them even more compelling than their Ethereum counterparts.

Asymmetric Financial has already garnered significant interest from ultra high net worth individuals and funds of funds, but the team declined to disclose the amount raised to date. The fund will primarily invest in tokens but will also consider equity deals. Beyond providing financial support, Held plans to leverage his expertise as a Bitcoin marketer and operator to help portfolio projects with brand positioning, customer acquisition, and market expansion.

Held predicts that the next ""DeFi summer,"" a period of explosive growth in the DeFi space, will take place on Bitcoin in 2025 or even sooner if developers can rapidly build out the necessary infrastructure. He believes that the unlocking of Bitcoin's value through DeFi represents the greatest opportunity in the history of cryptocurrency.

With its focus on Bitcoin DeFi, Asymmetric Financial is poised to capitalize on the untapped potential of this emerging sector. Led by a team of experienced investors and operators, the fund aims to drive innovation and unlock the full potential of DeFi on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Title: Garmin Forerunner 165 vs 265: A Tale of Two Running Watches

In the realm of running watches, Garmin's Forerunner series stands tall. Among them, the Forerunner 165 and 265 have sparked curiosity, especially for those seeking a balance between affordability and advanced features. Let's delve into the key differences between these two compelling options.

Music and Storage:

The Forerunner 265 offers music support as a standard feature, allowing you to stream tunes from your watch to wireless earphones. The 165, however, requires the ""With Music"" edition for this capability, which comes at an additional cost. Additionally, the 265 boasts double the storage capacity, providing more space for your favorite playlists.

Multi-band GPS:

The Forerunner 265 introduces multi-band GPS, a feature that enhances signal strength by operating on two frequency bands. While not always necessary, it proves invaluable in challenging environments like dense urban areas or under heavy tree cover.

Display and Durability:

At first glance, the 165 and 265 appear similar, with plastic casings and 5ATM water resistance. However, the 265 employs Gorilla Glass 3 for its display, while the 165 uses an unspecified ""chemically strengthened glass."" This difference may impact scratch resistance, though both fall short of the durability offered by Sapphire crystal.

Performance Metrics:

The 165 offers a range of fitness features, including route creation and on-wrist navigation. However, it lacks two crucial metrics found in the 265: performance condition and training load. These metrics provide valuable insights into your overall fitness and help you optimize your training routine.

Accessory Support:

The Forerunner 265 excels in accessory connectivity, with support for smart turbo trainers. This allows you to control your bike's resistance directly from your watch, enhancing your training experience. The 165, unfortunately, lacks this feature.

Battery Life:

The 265 boasts a longer battery life compared to the 165. While Garmin claims up to 11 days for the 165 and 15 days for the 265, real-world usage may result in shorter durations, particularly with continuous tracking and an always-on display.

Workout Animations:

The Forerunner 265 offers workout animations and muscle maps, providing visual guidance for various exercises. This feature caters to beginners seeking guidance on proper form and muscle engagement.

The Verdict:

The Forerunner 165 offers excellent value for budget-conscious shoppers, packing advanced features typically found in more expensive models. However, if you seek deeper stats, longer battery life, enhanced GPS, and compatibility with turbo trainers, the Forerunner 265 is worth considering.

Ultimately, the choice between these two Garmin watches depends on your individual needs and budget. Whether you're a seasoned runner or just starting out, both the 165 and 265 offer reliable performance and a wealth of features to help you achieve your fitness goals.

Navigating the Crossroads of Textile Recycling: A Deeper Dive

In the realm of sustainability, opinions often clash with scientific facts, leading to heated debates. The recent bankruptcy of Renewcell, a pioneer in textile-to-textile recycling technology, has sparked a flurry of questions and discussions. While the science behind their advanced recycling process is solid, the path to profitability remains elusive.

Renewcell's technology has proven effective, but a fundamental question lingers: why are these recycling facilities located in Europe and the U.S., far from the textile supply chain in Asia, where the vast majority of textiles are produced? The answer lies in a combination of factors, including investor preferences, brand presence, and renewable energy availability.

The absence of infrastructure and supply chain integration poses a significant challenge for advanced chemical recycling technologies. The majority of the world's textiles are made in Asia, and consumption in mature fashion markets is stagnating. Conversely, markets in Asia are poised for rapid growth, particularly in China and India.

The viability of textile circularity hinges on the economic feasibility for each stakeholder along the supply chain. Brands, typically removed from fiber sourcing and manufacturing processes, rely on garment manufacturers to handle material procurement and costings. In a challenging economic climate, brands prioritize cost-effective sourcing over sustainability, leading to a lack of orders for recycled fibers like Renewcell's Circulose.

The absence of a compelling business case for recycled fibers has far-reaching consequences, affecting not only Renewcell but also its supply chain partners, such as waste handlers and factories. The search for alternative markets for their waste adds to their economic woes.

A viable solution lies in integrating advanced recycling technologies into the existing supply chain in Asia, where infrastructure and operational data can be leveraged to evaluate the business case without relying solely on sustainability narratives. Countries like India and Bangladesh, with established mechanical textile recycling supply chains, are well-positioned to lead this transformation.

The next phase of textile-to-textile recycling holds promise in Asia, where recent initiatives like Fashion for Good, Canopy, and India's Re-START Alliance are fostering a circular textiles economy. By embracing innovation and collaboration, the industry can move towards a more sustainable future.

Introduction:
Windows 11, the latest operating system from Microsoft, has been the talk of the tech world since its release. While many users have praised its sleek look and user- friendly features, others have experienced issues that have left them frustrated and annoyed. One of the most common problems users face is the forced use of a Microsoft account, which is required in order to access certain features. This has led to concerns about data security and the potential for Microsoft's Artificial Intel (AI) program, Co-pilot, to access personal information.

Body:

1. Elon Musk's Grumble:
Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, known for his outspoken nature, recently voiced his dissatisfaction with the forced Microsoft account on Windows 11. He expressed concerns about the potential for Co-pilot to access his personal data and the lack of control over the program.

2. Microsoft's Reluctance:
Microsoft's decision to make a Microsoft account compulsory has been met with resistance from users who feel that their autonomy is being compromised. The lack of transparency regarding the data collected and the purposes for which it is used has further escalated user concerns.

3. Disgruntled Windows User:
A Windows user, echoing Musk's sentiments, expressed their indignation towards Microsoft's pushy tactics. They emphasized the need for Co-pilot to be an ""OPTION"", not a forced imposition.

4. Turning Off Co-pilot:
While Microsoft has made Co-pilot an unchangeable feature, it is still possible to disable it through a series of intricate steps. This process, however, is not without its challenges and can be risky for inexperienced users.

5. Alternative Methods:
For those who prefer a more direct approach, there are other options available. One can create a local account instead of a Microsoft account, or switch to a different operating system like linux.

Conclusion:
Windows 11 has undoubtedly brought about positive changes, yet its forced Microsoft account policy has left a bad taste in the mouths of many users. While Microsoft may have its reasons for implementing such a policy, it is essential for them to strike a balance between user autonomy and the need for data collection. The ability to choose whether or not to use Co-pilot would be a welcome step towards restoring user confidence and strengthening the relationship between Microsoft and its customers.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/c49efe39af0fc50e483b98831b66ff29e9ff8508/2024/02/27/5fec40d8-23b5-4eee-be85-e480b0548f4c/gettyimages-645605098.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-02-27 00:00:00

https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-ramps-up-efforts-to-combat-disinformation-ahead-of-crucial-eu-elections/,Meta ramps up efforts to combat disinformation ahead of crucial EU elections,"

As the European Parliament elections loom, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is taking proactive steps to combat misinformation and manipulation on its platforms.

Meta's head of EU affairs, Marco Pancini, outlined a comprehensive plan to ensure the integrity of the upcoming vote. This plan involves setting up an EU-specific Election Operations Center, expanding the network of fact-checking partners, and developing tools to detect and label AI-generated content.

The stakes are high, as the June elections will shape the future of the European Union at a critical juncture. Voter manipulation tactics could sway results, especially with the increasing sophistication of disinformation campaigns.

Meta has faced scrutiny over election interference since 2016, when Russian trolls exploited the platform to sow discord in the U.S. presidential race. Since then, the company has invested heavily in safety and security measures, including transparency measures for political ads.

However, experts caution that Meta's plan may have limitations. Recent reports indicate that the company failed to detect coordinated influence campaigns originating from China targeting Americans ahead of the 2022 midterms.

Critics argue that Meta's efforts lack teeth, despite expanding its fact-checking network to cover all 24 official EU languages and requiring disclosures for AI-generated content. They point out the absence of a reliable system to authenticate images and videos depicting violent confrontations between groups, making it challenging to debunk compelling fake footage.

The addition of only three more fact-checking partners is also seen as inadequate given the scale of the threat. The entire network of 29 organizations across Europe may struggle to keep up with the expected flood of misinformation surrounding such a crucial vote.

Furthermore, experts question the effectiveness of Meta's planned transparency labels for AI content. Currently, no reliable technology exists to detect AI forgeries with complete accuracy.

Past influence operations have exploited authentic voices like politicians, journalists, and influential individuals to amplify divisive narratives. As high-stakes elections unfold across 80 nations this year, even small-scale disinformation attempts may gain traction if amplified by public figures.

Meta's global threat intelligence lead, Ben Nimmo, acknowledges that covert influence campaigns often penetrate mainstream political discourse by co-opting reputable influencers. This remains a major vulnerability, as even a few shares by someone credible can lend legitimacy to false narratives linked to foreign interference.

As the EU elections approach, Meta remains vigilant. However, the evolving nature of deepfake technology adds complexity to the frontlines of information warfare. Meta's plan is a step in the right direction, but protecting democracy in the social media era remains an ongoing challenge. Authentic voices with power and influence will continue to be prime targets for manipulation.
