In the era of AI, data has become the new oil. Companies are licensing vast amounts of data from brokers to train their AI-powered products. However, the individual creators and owners of this data rarely see any financial benefits. A startup called Vana aims to change this narrative by allowing users to monetize their own data.

Vana is a platform co-founded by Anna Kazlauskas and Art Abal in 2021. Kazlauskas, with a background in computer science and economics, had previously launched a fintech automation startup. Abal, a corporate lawyer by training, worked as an associate at The Cadmus Group and headed up impact sourcing at Appen. 

Vana's mission is to build a platform that lets users ""pool"" their data, such as chats, speech recordings, and photos, into datasets for generative AI model training. The platform also aims to create more personalized experiences by fine-tuning public models on that data. In essence, Vana is creating a user-owned data treasury, allowing users to aggregate their personal data in a non-custodial way and own AI models for use across applications.

The Vana API connects a user's cross-platform personal data to allow developers to personalize their applications. The API provides instant access to a user's personalized AI model or underlying data, simplifying onboarding and eliminating compute cost concerns.

Users can create an account with Vana, attach data to a digital avatar, and explore apps built using Vana's platform and data sets. The app selection includes ChatGPT-style chatbots, interactive storybooks, and a Hinge profile generator.

But why would users volunteer their personal information to Vana in an age of increased data privacy awareness and ransomware attacks? Kazlauskas emphasizes that Vana's goal is for users to reclaim control over their data. Users have the option to self-host their data and control how their data is shared with apps and developers. Vana makes money by charging users a monthly subscription and levying a ""data transaction"" fee on developers, disincentivizing the exploitation of user data.

Ad Blockers: Unlikely Guardians Against Government Spyware","Title: Using Ad Blockers As A Shield Against Government Spyware: An Unlikely Hero

In today's digital age, we find ourselves grappling with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, one of which comes in the form of government spyware distributed via online ads. While ad blockers may initially appear to be an unusual line of defense, recent reports shed light on how spyware manufacturers utilize online advertisements to enable targeted surveillance. This revelation underscores the importance of incorporating ad blockers into our security strategies.

Spyware developers, such as the European company Intellexa, have devised methods to locate and covertly infect particular targets with tools like Predator spyware, granting them unfettered access to the entire contents of a compromised device in real time. According to information obtained by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Intellexa demonstrated a concept system named Aladdin in 2022, showcasing the ability to surreptitiously install phone spyware via online advertisements. By posing as potential employers offering job opportunities tailored to specific interests (e.g., graphic design, activism), attackers could discreetly introduce spyware to unsuspecting victims' devices. Although it remains uncertain whether Aladdin reached fruition or found buyers among government clients, another Israeli firm, Insanet, successfully created an ad-based infection mechanism capable of pinpointing individuals within an advertising network.

The pervasive nature of online advertising significantly expands the reach available to government entities seeking to surveil targets—including their detractors—through clandestine spying programs. Malware distribution via malicious online ads (malvertising) occurs when threat actors embed harmful code into the advertisements appearing on websites across various desktop and mobile browsers. Traditionally, many malvertising campaigns necessitate user engagement, such as clicking links or downloading infected files; however, given the extensive scope of internet advertising, even a single misleading ad could potentially impact countless users.

Fortunately, employing ad blockers provides an efficient countermeasure against malvertising and ad-based malware intrusions. These applications inhibit the display of advertisements within web browsers, obstructing the initial stage of malicious payload delivery. Moreover, ad-blocking solutions offer additional benefits concerning user privacy, as they hinder the capacity of ad networks to track site visits and monitor user activity throughout cyberspace. It is worth noting that similar protective measures exist for mobile platforms as well.

Cybersecurity professionals have consistently advocated for integrating ad blockers into personal and professional security protocols. In 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a Public Service Announcement endorsing the use of ad blockers as part of enhanced online safety practices. Renowned researchers investigating government espionage tools, like John Scott-Railton, a Senior Researcher at Citizen Lab, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the necessity of utilizing ad blockers to maintain safety in the face of evolving cyberthreats.

To recap, while ad blockers may not represent a comprehensive solution to protecting oneself from all forms of cyberattacks, they serve as valuable weapons in mitigating risks associated with malvertising and ad-based malware distributions. Bolstering your defenses by implementing reputable ad-blocking technology equips you with increased resiliency amidst the expanding landscape of cyber threats. With diligent vigilance and proactive measures, you contribute to safeguarding both your data and personal privacy, ensuring safer surfing experiences now and into the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/data-flowing-through-phone.jpg?resize=1200,638",2024-04-13 13:05:32,Protect yourself from government spyware - Utilize ad blockers!
