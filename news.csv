Summary: NPCI works towards balancing power in India's UPI ecosystem by engaging with various fintech companies and considering measures such as capping market shares and promoting indigenous ventures.","Title: NPCI's Initiative to Balance Power in India's UPI Ecosystem

Introduction

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is taking steps to address the rising market domination of PhonePe and Google Pay in the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) ecosystem. With plans to meet several fintech startups, including CRED, Flipkart, Fampay, and Amazon, NPCI aims to bolster UPI transaction volumes on their platforms and comprehend the support they need. This decision follows recent concerns voiced by legislators and industry stakeholders regarding the increasing control exercised by these two giants in India's digital payment landscape.

Current Market Scenario

UPI, developed through collaboration between Indian banks, has gained immense popularity as the primary method for online transactions in the country, processing over 10 billion monthly transactions. Alarmingly, Google Pay and PhonePe—with Walmart owning more than three-quarters of PhonePe—account for approximately 86% of all UPI transactions by volume. In comparison, Paytm, the third-larged UPI player, saw its market share drop to 9.1% by March 31st, down from 13% at the end of 2023 due to regulatory actions taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Growing Concerns & Proposed Solutions

Acknowledging the ""displeasure"" conveyed by the RBI concerning the deepening duopoly in the payments sector, the NPCI remains tight-lipped about potential solutions. Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee called upon the Indian government earlier this year to encourage indigenous fintech enterprises capable of providing alternatives to PhonePe and Google Pay. Moreover, the NPCI seeks to impose a cap of 30% on each UPI provider's market share; however, owing to technical constraints, it postponed the enforcement date to December 2024. To create a fairer competitive environment, India's central bank contemplates implementing incentive schemes designed explicitly for upcoming UPI participants. Additionally, reports suggest that the NPCI encourages fintech businesses to lure customers with rewards when performing UPI transactions via their applications.

Conclusion

As the battle against mounting concentration in India's UPI ecosystem unfolds, the NPCI plays a pivotal role in fostering healthy competition while maintaining innovation and customer satisfaction. By nurturing collaborations with diverse fintech entities, addressing regulator discontent, advocating for local competitors, and exploring novel ways to empower burgeoning UPI players, the NPCI strives to preserve a balanced and dynamic digital payments domain.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1213174164.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-17 04:27:55,"""NPCI meets fintech startups to balance UPI ecosystem; mulls 30% market share cap for providers""

Google's Jigsaw aims to enhance online dialogue through innovative AI tools targeting toxic commentary, fostering healthier conversations (Perspective API). The API evaluates comments using experimental bridging attributes, gauging nuance, curiosity, personal stories, reasoning, and respect towards others. However, understanding context remains crucial for optimal functionality.","Title: Harnessing AI to Enhance Online Dialogue: Google's Jigsaw Unveils New Tools

The internet is a melting pot of users, opinions, and conversations. Regrettably, not all interactions are positive or constructive. Google's subsidiary, Jigsaw, has recently introduced new tools to tackle toxic online commentary, aiming to foster healthier and more engaging discussions.

Jigsaw's Perspective API, an AI-powered tool, has been designed to identify and highlight comments that contribute positively to conversations. The API can be integrated into existing platforms, such as comment systems, websites, apps, and more. Its latest improvements include the addition of ""experimental bridging attributes,"" which evaluate comments based on several new criteria. These attributes include assessing whether a comment demonstrates nuance, curiosity, personal storytelling, reasoning, or shows deference or appreciation for others.

When a comment is analyzed by Perspective, it is evaluated across a range of attributes, including toxicity, insults, profanity, sexual explicitness, and the newly-added curiosity and nuance indicators. The API then assigns a score to each attribute, estimating the likelihood of a person perceiving the comment as toxic, profane, or abusive. As an example, Jigsaw explains that a comment like ""You are an idiot"" may receive a toxicity score of 0.8, indicating that 8 out of 10 people would view it as toxic.

Once a comment has been scored, users of the API must decide how to handle it. Jigsaw envisions a scenario where moderators could promote or demote comments based on their scores or set up custom filters to automatically remove comments deemed abusive by the AI.

Sadly, online platforms often become breeding grounds for unproductive debates, profanity, and harassment. While various services have attempted to address these issues with tools like user upvoting, filters, or disabling comments altogether, progress has been limited.

Jigsaw's new tools may help improve online discourse, but their effectiveness remains to be seen. Although Jigsaw's researchers have long advocated for their technology, challenges in understanding context still exist. While Perspective can objectively assess a comment's abusiveness, context often plays a critical role in determining whether a comment is toxic.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/f66ea6a4095e9db8780165564cd126f71a002168/2024/04/16/8d28ca32-ae43-4a21-8117-bf6c7a8527a3/puzzle-pieces-circle-jigsaw.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"""Google's Jigsaw introduces AI tools to combat toxic online commentary.

In response, NASA has invited the space community, including commercial providers, to propose alternative architectures for a Martian sample return mission, aiming for completion in the 2030s and a lower cost, risk, and mission complexity. This announcement could potentially result in a significant shift in the space industry, as companies like Intuitive Machines, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and SpaceX position themselves to secure multi-billion-dollar contracts.

Private industry has already demonstrated an ability to achieve more with fewer resources compared to traditional organizations. As a result, even if NASA allocates only half or a quarter of the original budget to a commercial mission, these companies are likely to deliver impressive results.

The new mission timeline also benefits launch companies, as heavy launch vehicles like Blue Origin's New Glenn, Rocket Lab's Neutron, and SpaceX's Starship may be operational by the time the mission is ready to proceed. This opens up the possibility of using these advanced launch systems for Mars exploration.

NASA's decision to rely more heavily on commercial services and hardware reflects the growing capabilities of the private space sector. This shift may encourage new commercial ambitions for Mars, similar to what was seen with the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. This initiative has led to the development of various spacecraft, vehicles, and landers by both established and emerging companies.

While no funds have been allocated yet, the promise of repurposing resources from the Mars Sample Return mission indicates that commercial involvement in Mars exploration will be more significant than ever before.

Innovative Firm Repurposes Aluminum Smelting Waste for Sustainable Solutions

New Breakthrough Turns Aluminum Waste into Steam & Hydrogen Power Source","Title: From Space Robots to Sustainable Energy: The Unconventional Journey of Found Energy

Found Energy, a groundbreaking startup, didn't begin in the typical garage or dorm room. Instead, its roots lie in a space robot designed to consume itself for fuel. The company is now harnessing that technology to revolutionize aluminum smelting and long-haul shipping industries. Here's the story of how a self-cannibalizing robot became an innovative solution for Earth's energy needs.

Peter Godart, Found Energy's co-founder and CEO, was once a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Alongside colleagues, Godart pondered how to power a probe that might journey to Jupiter's moon, Europa. The team debated the energy density of suitable batteries when Godart experienced an epiphany. Aluminum, the spacecraft's primary material, contained over ten times the energy of cutting-edge batteries. This revelation led Godart to propose using the spacecraft's components as fuel, birthing the 'self-cannibalizing robot lab' concept.

However, Godart's interests shifted towards addressing Earth's problems. At the time, Congress reduced funding for the Europa missions, and JPL allowed Godart to take the intellectual property to MIT. Here, he continued exploring the potential of aluminum energy storage during his doctorate.

Aluminum offered several clear benefits, including abundance in the Earth's crust, high energy storage capacity, and the ability to recover 70% of the original electrical energy used for smelting as heat. Godart realized the potential of his discovery and began working on a method to release the energy stored in refined aluminum.

Godart's technique overcomes aluminum's natural resistance to oxidation. When water is added to aluminum coated with Found Energy's catalyst, the surface quickly begins to bubble, releasing heat and hydrogen gas. The aluminum expands, forming a gray powder—a process referred to as 'fractal exfoliation.' The resulting steam and hydrogen can be used for various industrial processes, including the generation of heat across a wide temperature range.

The byproduct, aluminum trihydrate powder, is not waste. It can be smelted again to create metallic","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gadi-Ruschin-found-energy.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-17 13:00:54,"Discover Sustainable Aluminum Smelting & Shipping Solutions with Found Energy!

In the realm of aluminum production, traditional methods require large amounts of electricity and emit greenhouse gases. By contrast, Found Energy's novel approach promises sustainability without sacrificing efficiency. Using their proprietary catalyst, the reaction between water and aluminum could potentially replace the need for carbon electrodes entirely. Moreover, it recycles spent aluminum while producing valuable byproducts like hydrogen and steam. In essence, Found Energy is poised to transform the pollutive aluminum industry into one focused on recycling and renewables.

Similarly, the maritime sector faces increasing pressure to reduce emissions. Long-haul ships rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global warming. Hydrogen fuel cells offer promising alternatives; however, they are expensive and challenging to scale due to low availability and purity concerns. Found Energy's innovation provides an opportunity to tackle both issues simultaneously. Their cost-effective aluminum reactors produce hydrogen locally, ensuring consistent quality and affordability. Integrating these systems into marine vessels would lead to substantial reductions in harmful exhaust fumes, helping the world meet climate goals.

In conclusion, Found Energy has evolved from developing self-cannibalizing robots for interplanetary travel to providing revolutionary solutions for Earth's most pressing challenges. Through ingenuity and determination, Peter Godart and his team have unlocked new possibilities for sustainable energy usage in heavy industries such as aluminum smelting and long-haul shipping.

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a cornerstone of technological innovation, powering various applications across industries. However, a recent report by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence raises concerns about the escalating costs and inconsistent risk assessment methods associated with developing advanced AI models. This article delves into these critical issues, exploring the implications for the future of AI development.

The Surge in Training Costs

One notable revelation from the report is the exponential increase in the cost of training large language models. Foundation models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini Ultra, require astronomical computational resources. According to the report, GPT-4 consumed approximately $78 million worth of computing power during its training phase, while Gemini Ultra gobbled up a staggering $191 million. These figures represent a massive leap from previous generations of AI models—for instance, the original Transformer model, launched in 2017, cost only around $900 to train.

This surge in training costs can be attributed to the growing complexity and scale of AI models. Modern AI systems demand substantially larger computational resources compared to their predecessors. For example, the original Google Transformer required roughly 10,000 petaFLOPs (10,000 trillion floating-point operations), whereas the latest iterations approach nearly a hundred billion petaFLOPs. Consequently, the financial burden imposed by AI model training will likely continue to rise, potentially creating barriers to entry for smaller organizations and startups.

Fragmented Responsible AI Benchmarks

While the monetary aspect presents a considerable challenge, another pressing concern revolves around ensuring the safety and ethical use of AI models. Evaluating AI programs based on aspects such as transparency, explainability, and data privacy remains challenging due to the absence of uniform standards and benchmarks. Although several tests exist to gauge 'Responsible AI,' developers employ varying metrics, making consistent evaluations and cross-comparisons problematic.

Standardizing Responsible AI Metrics

The Stanford HAI report highlights the need for standardized benchmark reporting to ensure transparent and accurate assessments of AI models' safety features. Currently, when examining five prominent AI model developers—OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google, and Mistral AI—no universal set of responsible AI benchmarks exists. While certain commonalities appear among the general capability evaluation criteria employed by these entities, discrepancies arise regarding responsible AI measurements.

Conclusion

As AI continues to evolve and permeate diverse sectors, addressing the challenges surrounding ballooning training expenses and fragmented safety assessments becomes crucial. Standardizing responsible AI benchmarks and promoting collaboration between stakeholders could help alleviate some of these concerns. By fostering open dialogue and cooperation, we can build a safer, more inclusive AI landscape capable of driving meaningful progress without compromising ethics or affordability.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/cc9017c6b0db4453826780898e3d6005fadece54/2024/04/16/007e1ffe-3799-4883-a57e-02882b52f4a5/ai-chatbot2-gettyimages-1995269744.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"""Explore rising costs & fragmented safety measures in AI models.

","Title: A Monumental Discovery: The Largest Stellar Black Hole in the Milky Way

In the heart of our Milky Way galaxy resides a supermassive black hole, but orbiting around it are smaller stellar black holes. These are remnants of massive stars that have reached the end of their life cycle and undergone gravitational collapse. Scientists estimate that our galaxy harbors around 100 million of these stellar black holes, yet only a fraction have been identified.

Recently, the European Space Agency's Gaia mission has led to an unprecedented discovery. A team of ESA scientists, while sifting through Gaia data, identified a colossal stellar black hole in our very own galaxy. Dubbed Gaia BH3, this behemoth is 33 times the mass of our sun, surpassing the previous record of 21 solar masses. Furthermore, it is located a mere 1,926 light-years away, making it the second-closest known black hole to Earth.

Gaia BH3 proved to be an elusive discovery. Its inconspicuous nature is attributed to the absence of nearby celestial bodies that could provide matter and emit X-rays, making it difficult to detect with current telescopes. This recent revelation also marks the first time we have discovered a black hole of such immense size within the Milky Way; previously, comparable black holes had only been identified in distant galaxies.

The team utilized data from ground-based observatories such as the European Southern Observatory to confirm the size and location of Gaia BH3. The star orbiting this behemoth has an exceptionally low abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Given that binary star systems often share similar compositions, scientists speculate that Gaia BH3's progenitor star could have been similarly deficient in heavy elements.

The formation of high-mass black holes has long been associated with metal-poor stars. Due to their reduced mass loss throughout their lifetimes, these stars retain more mass by the time they collapse, making it possible for them to form massive black holes. Gaia BH3 serves as the first concrete evidence linking metal-poor stars to the creation of massive stellar black holes, further solidifying our understanding of how older giant stars differ from their younger",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yAmL17Kezyz5jOyjxfMV2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODQ-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/e6fd2750-fc8e-11ee-ade6-22992fce4792,2024-04-17 08:57:53,"Discover the largest stellar black hole in the Milky Way, Gaia BH3, at 33 solar masses.
