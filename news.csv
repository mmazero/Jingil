In a world where everyone has a story waiting to be told, a startup named Inkitt is revolutionizing the publishing industry with its AI-powered platform. Inkitt believes that the best stories deserve to be discovered and shared with the world, and it's using technology to make that happen.

Inkitt's journey began with its eponymous app, where aspiring writers can self-publish their stories. The app's AI and data science algorithms analyze these stories, identifying the most compelling ones. These selected stories are then refined, distributed, and sold on Inkitt's second app, Galatea.

The platform has already garnered immense popularity, boasting 33 million users and numerous bestsellers. With its Series C funding of $37 million, Inkitt aims to expand its content offerings, venturing into AI-generated stories, personalized fiction, games, audiobooks, and video content.

Inkitt's vision is to create a multimedia empire centered around its vast content library, akin to a modern-day Disney. CEO and founder Ali Albazaz envisions Inkitt as ""the Disney of the 21st century,"" a hub of captivating stories brought to life across various mediums.

The investment, led by Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, brings Inkitt's total funding to $117 million. Despite the challenging economic climate, Inkitt's impressive growth and potential have attracted investors, with rumors of another funding round in the works.

Inkitt's success stems from its innovative approach to storytelling. In an era where attention spans are shrinking, Inkitt focuses on delivering books in engaging formats, with shorter chapters, dynamic effects, and personalized content.

Through A/B testing and data analysis, Inkitt tailors its stories to readers' preferences, optimizing titles, storylines, and cliffhangers. This data-driven approach has resulted in a 20x higher success rate for publishing best-selling books compared to traditional publishers.

Inkitt's revenue has doubled in the past year, and its newer ventures, like Galatea TV, are generating substantial returns. The company is nearing profitability, and it offers higher royalties to writers, particularly those with less established profiles.

Despite its focus on undiscovered talent, Inkitt has faced challenges in collaborating with renowned authors who may be resistant to AI-suggested edits. However, Albazaz remains optimistic about the potential of AI in storytelling, aiming to incorporate AI-generated stories and personalized narratives into Inkitt's offerings.

Inkitt's experiments with various LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI, have shown promise in narrative construction. The company also utilizes DeepL for multilingual translations, ElevenLabs for audiobooks, and Leonardo for cover art.

Inkitt's cautious approach to IP rights ensures that it doesn't rely heavily on any single LLM, avoiding potential legal complications. This strategy aligns with Inkitt's mission to create a diverse and captivating content library.

Vinod Khosla, Inkitt's lead investor, believes that AI has the power to transform entertainment, making it hyper-personalized and meaningful. Inkitt's success in creating engaging stories that resonate with readers reinforces this vision.

As Inkitt continues to navigate the ever-changing landscape of storytelling, its commitment to innovation and its focus on delivering exceptional content position it as a trailblazer in the entertainment industry.

In a world where everyone holds a story within them, Inkitt, an innovative startup, aims to transform the most captivating of these narratives into blockbusters, shaping a 21st-century ""Disney"" around this wealth of content. With a recent funding boost of $37 million, Inkitt embarks on an ambitious journey to expand its horizons.

Through its eponymous app, Inkitt empowers aspiring writers to self-publish their stories. Employing AI and data science, the platform identifies the most compelling tales, refines them, and distributes them on a second app called Galatea, where readers can purchase and enjoy these literary gems. This unique approach has already garnered 33 million users and produced numerous bestsellers.

The fresh infusion of capital, secured in a Series C funding round, will fuel Inkitt's expansion into diverse content formats. The company envisions AI-generated stories based on original ideas, personalized fiction tailored to individual readers, a foray into games and audiobooks, and captivating video content adapted from its platform's stories. While humans currently produce these videos, AI will eventually take the reins.

CEO and founder Ali Albazaz harbors a long-term vision of expanding Inkitt's content library and establishing a multimedia empire, akin to a modern-day Disney. This aspiration sets Inkitt apart from competitors like Wattpad, propelling it towards becoming the ""Disney of the 21st century.""

The $37 million Series C funding round was led by Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, with participation from previous backers NEA, Kleiner Perkins, Redalpine, and undisclosed investors. This latest investment brings Inkitt's total funding to $117 million, positioning the company at a valuation of approximately $400 million post-money.

Inkitt's ambitions stand in stark contrast to the prevailing trend of declining reading habits. With the rise of mobile devices and apps that fragment consumers' attention, the average American adult now spends a mere 15 minutes reading per day, down from 20 minutes just a few years ago. The average number of books read and completed has also dwindled to around 5.

Defying this trend, Inkitt believes it can capture more significant reading time and engagement by innovating the book experience. The company focuses on shorter, mobile-friendly chapters, incorporating dynamic effects like sounds to enhance the reading experience, and tailoring books to readers' preferences through extensive A/B testing.

This data-driven approach has proven successful. Inkitt, Galatea, and the recently launched Galatea TV have all witnessed a surge in engagement time, even as other services that thrived during the Covid-19 pandemic have experienced a decline.

Inkitt claims to rank as the number 11 best-selling publisher globally, surpassing established names like Penguin Random House. Albazaz attributes this success to their algorithms, which he claims yield a 20-fold higher chance of publishing a bestseller compared to traditional publishers.

Revenues have doubled in the past year, and newer projects like Galatea TV are generating substantial returns. A TV series based on the Galatea book ""Beautiful Mistake"" alone has raked in $500,000 in revenue. The company is edging closer to profitability, and royalties for writers are reportedly higher than those offered by traditional publishers.

Inkitt's focus is firmly on fiction, but the company steers clear of literary fiction. Albazaz prefers to avoid the headaches of working with established authors and their egos, instead choosing to nurture undiscovered talent.

AI-generated stories, based on captivating treatments crafted by talented humans, are a key part of Inkitt's future plans. The company is also exploring personalized stories using AI algorithms, though this remains a work in progress.

To realize this vision, Inkitt collaborates with various LLMs, including APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI. They customize these LLMs and combine them with other AI tools for narrative construction, automatic translation into 10 languages, audiobook generation, and cover art creation.

Inkitt's approach is driven by the belief that LLMs alone cannot create best-selling content. The company's data, gathered over years of experience, plays a crucial role in refining and personalizing these AI-generated stories.

This strategic approach has attracted the attention of prominent investors like Vinod Khosla, who believes that the future of entertainment lies in hyper-personalized experiences. Inkitt's mission and early success align perfectly with this vision.

As Inkitt navigates the ever-changing landscape of AI and content creation, it remains committed to its goal of building an AI-powered content empire, transforming captivating stories into blockbusters and creating a multimedia universe that rivals the likes of Disney.

In the realm of photography, the allure of the past has found a new expression in Lapse, a smartphone app that transports users back to the days of analogue cameras. This innovative platform offers a unique blend of nostalgia and modern technology, allowing users to capture and share photos with a distinctive old-school charm.

Lapse has gained significant traction, boasting millions of users and capturing over 100 million photos each month. Its popularity has earned it a coveted spot among the top 10 photographic apps in the U.S. app store. Recognizing its potential, Greylock and DST Global Partners, renowned investors in the consumer app sector, have joined forces to lead a new round of funding worth $30 million. This investment will fuel Lapse's ambitious plans to elevate the photo experience and venture into the realm of video.

The app's ethos is rooted in the belief that the unedited, spontaneous moments hold a special charm. Lapse embraces this philosophy by eliminating the ability to edit photos or retake shots, encouraging users to embrace the imperfections and authenticity of the moment.

Behind the scenes, Lapse employs a sophisticated processing pipeline that enhances the captured photos. This process involves a series of steps, including computer vision algorithms and proprietary technology, to optimize the composition and enhance the overall aesthetics of the images.

However, Lapse's growth strategy has faced some scrutiny, with concerns raised about its use of growth-hacking techniques and forced invites to expand its user base. While these tactics may have contributed to the app's initial surge in popularity, the company acknowledges the need for a more sustainable approach that focuses on delivering genuine value to users.

Lapse is at a crossroads in the ever-evolving landscape of consumer apps. While dominant platforms like Instagram and Facebook have shifted their focus beyond sharing with small groups of friends, Lapse sees an opportunity to fill this void by providing a space where users can reconnect with their close circles and share authentic moments without the pressure of social validation.

Investors share Lapse's vision, recognizing the potential for a platform that fosters genuine connections and celebrates the beauty of unedited moments. Jacob Andreou, a general partner at Greylock, believes that Lapse can capture the essence of early social media platforms, where users could simply keep up with their friends' lives without the distractions of news, entertainment, or influencer culture.

As Lapse continues its journey, it aims to strike a balance between preserving the charm of analogue photography and embracing technological advancements to enhance the user experience. With a dedicated team and a supportive investor group, Lapse is poised to make a lasting impact on the way we capture and share our memories.

In the realm of artificial intelligence, a new player has emerged, aiming to challenge the dominance of ChatGPT in the enterprise sector. Glean, a brainchild of Arvind Jain, the co-founder of Rubrik, seeks to revolutionize the way employees access and utilize information within their organizations.

Driven by the observation that employees often struggle to find the information they need to perform their jobs, Jain envisioned Glean as a custom ChatGPT for enterprises. Glean connects to a company's first- and third-party databases, enabling employees to pose plain-English queries and receive relevant answers.

Glean's journey began as an AI-powered search app, similar to Microsoft's SharePoint Syntex and Amazon Kendra. However, it has evolved into a platform that analyzes a company's databases and data stores to provide insightful answers to employee inquiries. Glean ingests information from various sources, including support tickets, chat messages, and customer relationship management platforms, and applies generative AI to extract meaningful insights.

One might question the security implications of connecting proprietary data to a generative AI platform. However, Jain emphasizes that Glean respects the permissions set in a company's data sources, ensuring that employees only receive answers based on the data they are authorized to access. Additionally, Glean employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground its responses in external knowledge sources, making every answer fully referenceable.

While generative AI is prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies, Glean employs several strategies to mitigate these risks. The platform is trained on customer data to learn industry-specific jargon and allows customers to switch among various open-source generative AI models to enhance reliability.

Glean's business model revolves around a monthly per-seat subscription, and despite competition from tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI, the company has experienced remarkable growth, with annual recurring revenue quadrupling in the past year. This success story has attracted investors, resulting in a recent $200 million Series D funding round led by Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

The funding will fuel Glean's expansion plans, including team growth, product enhancement, and a robust go-to-market strategy. Jain believes that Glean is poised to transform the way people work, empowering knowledge workers with the information they need to excel in their roles.

The Displace Wireless TV: A Revolutionary Viewing Experience

In a world of sleek, modern technology, the Displace wireless TV stands out as a remarkable innovation. This unique television system, showcased at CES 2023 and now unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, is set to redefine the way we experience visual content.

The Displace wireless TV, spearheaded by founder and CEO Balaji Krishna, is a 55-inch 4K OLED TV that boasts a revolutionary mounting system, eliminating the need for traditional mounts or stands. With its vacuum suction technology, the Displace TV seamlessly attaches to any wall, window, or even a curved surface, transforming any room into a home theater.

The Displace TV's innovative features extend beyond its mounting system. The company is actively developing new models, including the smaller 27-inch 'Display Mini', designed for kitchens and bathrooms. Additionally, Displace is exploring the integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as an AI-powered shopping engine and a payment reader, into its devices.

The AI-powered shopping engine will allow viewers to purchase products directly from on-screen advertisements, while the payment reader will enable secure transactions without the need for additional devices. Displace is also incorporating a thermal camera into its devices, which has potential applications in healthcare, such as detecting inflammation by reading body heat maps.

The Displace wireless TV is a testament to the company's commitment to innovation and its dedication to enhancing the viewing experience. The company is currently fulfilling pre-orders and aims to commence shipping in mid-2023. Displace is also planning a ""small series A"" fundraising round of $5 million to further fuel its growth.

The Displace wireless TV has generated significant interest from art studios, museums, and even embassies, owing to its versatile mounting options and its ability to transform any space into a captivating display. While traditional TV setups suffice for most consumers, businesses and organizations seeking unique display solutions have found Displace to be a compelling choice.

The Displace wireless TV utilizes a vacuum suction system to adhere to various surfaces, including dry walls, without the need for drilling or nails. It is powered by swappable batteries that provide up to 10 months of viewing time. If the vacuum system fails, the TV gradually lowers itself using a zipline-like mechanism, ensuring the safety of both the device and the wall.

The Displace wireless TV is a groundbreaking product that seamlessly blends form and function. Its innovative mounting system and cutting-edge features make it a compelling choice for those seeking a truly immersive viewing experience.

Superhuman's AI-Powered Instant Replies: Revolutionizing Email Communication

In the fast-paced world of today, email has become an essential tool for communication. However, managing a cluttered inbox can be overwhelming, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress. Superhuman, an innovative email startup, is introducing a game-changing feature that aims to transform the way we interact with emails: AI-powered instant replies.

Superhuman's instant replies feature provides users with three contextual response options when composing an email. These options are designed to be relevant to the content of the received email, allowing users to respond quickly and efficiently. Unlike other AI-powered email assistants, Superhuman's feature is more contextual and personal, taking into account the sender's name and the overall tone of the email.

To use the instant replies feature, simply hit the reply button in an email. Superhuman will then generate three potential reply options. Clicking on any of these options will display a full-sentence reply, which can be further customized or sent directly. This feature is particularly useful for responding to common inquiries or scheduling requests, saving users valuable time and effort.

Superhuman's commitment to AI-powered features doesn't stop at instant replies. The company has already launched several other AI-driven products, including Superhuman AI, which helps users draft better emails, and an auto-summarize feature that provides a one-line summary of emails. These features are designed to streamline the email workflow and make communication more efficient.

Superhuman's AI-powered features set it apart from competitors in the email space. The company's focus on stickiness, with users utilizing AI an average of 25 times per week, demonstrates the effectiveness of its AI-driven solutions. Superhuman's roadmap includes further advancements in AI, aiming to automate certain aspects of a user's daily workflow, such as scheduling and email composition.

While Superhuman has maintained its $30 per month pricing since its launch, the company is considering revisiting its pricing strategy later this year. Additionally, Superhuman is exploring the development of special edition email clients tailored to specific professions, such as sales executives and customer managers, with integrations for popular tools like Salesforce and Hubspot.

Superhuman's mission is to transform email from a mere productivity tool into a platform for smart collaboration. The company envisions a future where email threads can be shared internally, allowing teams to add comments and reactions, fostering a more collaborative and efficient work environment.

Superhuman's AI-powered instant replies and its commitment to innovation are poised to revolutionize the way we communicate via email. By providing users with contextual and personalized response options, Superhuman is empowering individuals and teams to manage their inboxes more effectively and communicate more efficiently.

Humane Expands Horizons: South Korea to Embrace the Ai Pin

Humane, the AI-powered wearable device company, has set its sights on global expansion, beginning with South Korea. This move comes after the company's initial plans for a March release in the U.S. market were pushed back to mid-April.

The Ai Pin, Humane's flagship product, is a wearable device that combines sensors, generative AI capabilities, and a mini projector to display information on any surface. It's a unique form factor that aims to revolutionize how we interact with information.

To power the Ai Pin, Humane offers a subscription plan that includes a phone number and unlimited data for AI-powered queries. This positions Humane as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in partnership with T-Mobile in the U.S.

Despite delays in the U.S. launch and a recent round of layoffs, Humane's partnership with SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile provider, signals a positive trajectory for the company. This strategic investment opportunity extends beyond a simple MVNO tie-up, as SK Telecom plans to license Humane's CosmOS, the AI-enabled operating system that powers the Ai Pin.

SK Telecom has been actively bolstering its AI offerings, launching its own ChatGPT competitor called A.Dot and expressing ambitions to become a global AI company through strategic partnerships. This partnership with Humane aligns with that goal, as the two companies aim to collaborate on new subscription offerings and revenue opportunities for an app-less OS and ecosystem in the Korean market.

While the exact timeline for the Ai Pin's South Korean launch remains uncertain, given the delays in the U.S., it's likely to take some time. Nevertheless, this expansion marks a significant step for Humane as it seeks to establish a global presence and revolutionize the way we interact with information.

In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), a new player has emerged, ready to challenge the dominance of established giants like OpenAI. Mistral AI, a Paris-based startup, has unveiled its latest creation: Mistral Large, a cutting-edge large language model (LLM) poised to rival the likes of GPT-4 and Claude 2.

But this announcement was accompanied by another significant development: a strategic partnership with tech giant Microsoft. This alliance marks a major milestone for Mistral AI, bringing not only financial support but also access to Microsoft's vast resources and customer base.

Microsoft's investment of €15 million in Mistral AI is a testament to the startup's potential. This investment will be converted into equity during Mistral AI's next funding round, indicating Microsoft's long-term commitment to the company's growth.

The partnership extends beyond financial investment. Mistral AI's flagship LLM, Mistral Large, will now be available to Azure customers through Azure's model catalog. This integration opens up new avenues for developers and businesses to leverage the power of Mistral AI's language processing capabilities.

This move is particularly significant in light of the ongoing scrutiny that Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI has attracted from regulators in Europe and the UK. By investing in Mistral AI, Microsoft is diversifying its portfolio of AI partnerships, ensuring continued access to cutting-edge language models for its customers.

The European Commission has taken notice of this investment, indicating that it will closely examine the deal as part of its ongoing monitoring of interactions between large tech companies and generative AI firms.

While Mistral AI has positioned itself as a European AI champion, its recent moves towards a closed-source approach and its growing list of American backers have raised questions about its commitment to European values.

As the AI landscape continues to evolve, Mistral AI's partnership with Microsoft marks a pivotal moment. It remains to be seen how this alliance will shape the future of AI development and whether Mistral AI can maintain its identity as a European AI leader.

The Art of Retention: AI-Powered Platform Helps Businesses Keep Subscribers Engaged

In today's digital landscape, subscription-based business models are all the rage. From streaming services to digital publishing and beyond, companies are vying for a slice of the recurring revenue pie. But with the cost of acquiring new customers skyrocketing, businesses are increasingly turning their attention to retention strategies.

Enter Subsets, a Danish startup that's using AI to help companies reduce churn and keep subscribers engaged. Founded in 2022, Subsets has already gained traction with notable clients like the New York Times-owned Athletic and Danish newspaper Børsen. Now, the company has secured $1.65 million in pre-seed funding to fuel its growth.

The Power of Explainable AI

Subsets' secret weapon is its explainable AI platform. Unlike traditional AI systems that often operate as black boxes, Subsets' AI is designed to provide clear and understandable explanations for its recommendations. This makes it easier for businesses to understand why certain subscribers are at risk of churning and what actions they can take to prevent it.

Tailored Experiments for Maximum Impact

Subsets doesn't just analyze data; it also empowers businesses to take action. The platform allows non-technical teams to run targeted retention experiments on subsets of their subscriber base. These experiments can range from personalized push notifications to exclusive discounts or free upgrades.

The results of these experiments are then analyzed to identify the most effective retention strategies. These strategies are then automated, ensuring that businesses can continuously optimize their retention efforts.

A Focus on Digital Media

While Subsets can be applied to any subscription business, the company is currently focused on the digital media vertical. This includes digital publishers, streaming platforms, subscription apps, and telecoms.

Subsets connects to a company's internal systems to gather subscriber data points such as demographics, content consumption patterns, and customer interactions. This data is then used to identify subscribers who are at risk of churning.

A Promising Future

With its AI-powered platform and a fresh infusion of funding, Subsets is poised for growth. The company plans to expand its reach beyond digital media and explore other subscription categories such as mobility, banking, and food delivery.

As more and more businesses embrace subscription-based models, Subsets is well-positioned to become a key player in the retention game. By helping companies keep their subscribers engaged and satisfied, Subsets is paving the way for a future where recurring revenue reigns supreme.

This collective support underscores the confidence in Shadowfax's mission to streamline logistics operations and address the challenges of India's fragmented last-mile delivery infrastructure.

India's consumer delivery networks often grapple with inefficiencies, complex urban environments, and inconsistent service quality. Small businesses, in particular, face the brunt of these challenges, lacking the resources to establish sophisticated delivery capabilities. Shadowfax steps in to bridge this gap by unifying disparate elements in the last-mile ecosystem, bringing much-needed efficiency and reliability to the delivery process.

With its extensive network reaching over 2,500 cities and 15,000 zip codes, Shadowfax has become an indispensable partner for numerous businesses, including Flipkart, Meesho, and various direct-to-consumer brands. The company's unwavering commitment to quality has resulted in an impressive track record of customer retention, with not a single customer lost in the past five years.

Shadowfax's remarkable growth is largely attributed to the burgeoning quick-commerce sector in India. The company's hyper-local arm has forged strategic partnerships with leading quick-commerce firms, enabling same-day and next-day deliveries for brands across the country.

Since its inception in 2015, Shadowfax has raised over $220 million in primary and secondary transactions, a testament to its unwavering commitment to innovation and operational excellence. Amit Gupta, Partner and Head of India and Southeast Asia at TPG NewQuest, hailed Shadowfax as a revolutionary force in India's e-commerce logistics sector.

Mirae Asset Venture Investments, which participated in each subsequent round of funding, recognizes the fundamental role logistics plays in the growth of e-commerce and hyperlocal commerce. Ashish Dave, CEO of Mirae Asset Venture Investments (India), commended Shadowfax's scalable platform and its ability to deliver exceptional results even during challenging times.

Shadowfax's unwavering focus on network expansion, organizational growth, and financial discipline has positioned the company as a trailblazer in India's logistics industry. The company's commitment to innovation and customer-centricity will undoubtedly continue to drive its success in the years to come.

In the digital age, the relationship between tech giants like Google and news publishers has come under scrutiny. South Africa has joined the growing chorus of countries demanding transparency from Google regarding its dealings with news organizations.

Caxton, a prominent media organization in South Africa, along with the Centre for Free Expression, has taken legal action against Google, seeking answers to a series of questions about the information and revenue generated from news publishers.

The crux of the matter lies in the nature of programmatic advertising, which, according to Caxton chairman Paul Jenkins, fails to distinguish between genuine news and disinformation, or real users and click farms. This indiscriminate approach has led to concerns that journalism is under threat, as news organizations struggle to compete with clickbait and fake news for advertising revenue.

Jenkins emphasizes the importance of news as a public good and freedom of expression, likening the current situation to a tipping point similar to the climate crisis. He argues that the lack of transparency from Google and other tech platforms hinders media organizations' ability to protect these rights.

Studies have estimated that Google and Meta owe US publishers billions of dollars annually for the news content they distribute. However, tech giants have resisted paying traditional licensing and copyright fees, often providing meager payments or private deals to a select few large news operations.

This lopsided arrangement has contributed to the decline of local media, particularly in South Africa, where the cost-per-impression for programmatic ads is extremely low, leaving publishers with a tiny fraction of the advertising revenue.

The reliance on programmatic advertising has also raised concerns about the accuracy and validity of metrics used by platforms like Facebook and Google. Instances of inflated or misrepresented metrics have surfaced, leading to questions about the effectiveness of these ads and the value they provide to advertisers.

To address these issues, countries like Australia and Canada have introduced legislation requiring tech platforms to compensate media organizations for the news content they distribute. While such measures have shown some success, the battle for transparency and fair compensation continues.

Caxton's legal action against Google reflects the growing frustration among media organizations worldwide, who are grappling with the challenges posed by the digital revolution and the dominance of tech giants. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the future of journalism and the relationship between news publishers and digital platforms.

A significant portion of these accidents stems from lane departures, highlighting the crucial role of clear and visible roadway markings in ensuring driver safety.

Governments across the nation are responding with initiatives to enhance the visibility of paint lines and roadway striping. However, the current metric used to assess roadway markings, known as retro-reflectivity, focuses solely on nighttime performance, ignoring the equally important daytime visibility.

This narrow focus on nighttime conditions overlooks the fact that human drivers and vehicle cameras rely on paint lines in various lighting conditions, including daytime glare, rain, and fog. As a result, we often encounter signs that appear reflective at night but are barely visible during the day, or brand-new paint lines that vanish in wet weather.

To address this discrepancy, we need to embrace a more comprehensive approach to roadway safety by incorporating daytime visibility metrics. One promising technology that can revolutionize paint line assessments is computer vision, which simulates the human eye and is widely used in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

Computer vision offers a more accurate representation of how humans and autonomous vehicles perceive the roadway, enabling us to evaluate paint line performance under various conditions. By leveraging this technology, we can identify areas where markings need improvement, ensuring better visibility for all road users.

The adoption of computer vision for roadway assessments requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, roadway authorities, and technology providers. Partnerships like the one between Mobileye, a leading ADAS provider, and 3M, a manufacturer of roadway striping materials, demonstrate the potential of this approach in enhancing roadway safety.

As we strive towards Vision Zero, a world with zero fatalities, it's imperative that we evolve our measurement of roadway success. By embracing full-time visibility metrics and leveraging computer vision technology, we can create safer roadways for human drivers and autonomous vehicles alike.

The 2026 FHWA paint line visibility rule presents an opportunity to usher in this new era of roadway safety. By adopting a forward-thinking approach, we can transform our roadways into safer spaces, reducing fatalities and supporting the growing adoption of driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technology.

Title: ""A New Era of Sustainability: Embracing the Multi-Solve Approach""

In today's rapidly changing world, businesses face a unique challenge: achieving sustainability while maintaining growth and profitability. For many years, these two objectives were often seen as conflicting, leading to a sense of tension between environmental responsibility and economic success. However, a new approach is emerging, one that offers a path to both sustainability and prosperity: the multi-solve approach.

The multi-solve approach recognizes that sustainability can bring multiple benefits to a business, beyond just reducing environmental impact. By integrating efficiency, electrification, and digitalization, companies can unlock new opportunities for cost savings, revenue generation, and improved resilience.

Katie McGinty, Chief Sustainability Officer of Johnson Controls, shared a compelling example of this multi-solve approach in action. A hospital in Alabama implemented a comprehensive sustainability program that resulted in a remarkable 78% reduction in natural gas usage, a 34% decrease in carbon emissions, and a 32% drop in electricity bills. Additionally, the program enabled the hospital to detect and resolve maintenance issues swiftly, minimizing disruptions and costs.

This multi-solve approach is gaining traction among forward-thinking businesses. A recent study by PWC revealed that 58% of CEOs recognize climate change as a pressing issue that demands action. However, a smaller study by Accenture and the World Economic Forum indicated that many CEOs still struggle to reconcile sustainability with growth.

Despite the challenges, there is a growing momentum towards climate action. California recently enacted two Climate Laws that require businesses operating within the state to disclose climate-related risks. Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to release climate risk disclosure rules soon. These developments underscore the increasing importance of climate risk management for businesses.

The trifecta of electrification, digitalization, and decarbonization offers a path to sustainability that can also drive business success. McGinty shared the inspiring story of a brewery that transformed its wastewater challenge into a revenue stream by converting it into renewable natural gas. This innovative solution not only reduced the brewery's environmental impact but also created a new source of income.

Businesses are driven to adopt sustainable solutions by both push and pull factors. On the push side, there's pressure to reduce costs, attract top talent, and mitigate financial risks associated with climate change. On the pull side, governments worldwide offer financial incentives, grants, and tax credits to encourage businesses to invest in sustainability initiatives.

The time is ripe for businesses to embrace the multi-solve approach and reap the benefits of sustainability. By aligning with their environmental-social-governance (ESG) values, companies can attract top talent, reduce costs, and unlock new revenue streams. The Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provide significant financial support for businesses to accelerate their progress towards sustainability.

As Katie McGinty aptly stated, ""It's never been a better time to say, 'let me avail myself of the hand up I have here in grants and low interest loans and other incentives that have been put in place to really try to accelerate progress in this regard.'""
