Introduction

In a remarkable breakthrough, researchers from Meta AI, Stanford University, Technische Universität Dresden, and the German Cancer Research Center (DFKZ) have developed DIGIT Pinki, a miniature tactile sensor designed to mimic human touch capabilities. Based on previous sensor designs like DIGIT and OmniTact, DIGIT Pinki incorporates concepts from older research to create a vision-based tactile sensor that can be integrated into new medical technologies and robotic systems. This groundbreaking invention could revolutionize fields such as robotics, healthcare, and medical diagnostics.

Building a Better Tactile Sensor

DIGIT Pinki is a vision-based tactile sensor that uses images from a miniature camera to detect tactile information, similar to a human fingertip. The sensor utilizes a transparent gel fingertip that deforms upon contact with objects. An internal camera with lights captures images of these deformations, and a machine learning algorithm processes the image data, accurately interpreting tactile information such as contact forces with an object.

To create this innovative sensor, the researchers revisited older design ideas from the 1980s, like those outlined in a seminal paper by S. Begej. By integrating fiber optic bundles to relay images to a remotely located camera, they were able to shrink the gel fingertip significantly, making it non-magnetic and devoid of electronics. This design makes DIGIT Pinki an attractive option for medical applications, such as use within the human body or in an MRI machine.

A New Frontier in Medical Applications

One potential real-world application for DIGIT Pinki is cancer diagnostics in constrained spaces. By accurately detecting subtle differences in tissue stiffness, the sensor could potentially differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissue during routine rectal or cervical exams. The researchers have already demonstrated DIGIT Pinki's ability to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy tissue on medical-grade phantoms and ex vivo posterior prostate tissue.

Introduction

Muscles, being nature's perfect actuators, are incredibly powerful and precise for their size. Engineers have long sought to harness this potential to power robots, with some successful demonstrations of ""biohybrid"" robots utilizing muscle-based actuators for movement. However, there hasn't been a consistent blueprint for maximizing muscle power and precision in different robotic designs. A new development from MIT engineers may change that.

A New Spring-Like Device for Muscle-Powered Robots

MIT engineers have designed a spring-like device, or ""flexure,"" that could serve as a basic skeleton-like module for various muscle-bound bots. This new spring is specifically designed to get the most work out of any attached muscle tissues, maximizing the amount of movement that muscles can naturally produce.

The researchers discovered that when they fit a ring of muscle tissue onto the device, the muscle pulled on the spring reliably and repeatedly, stretching it five times more compared to previous designs. This consistent, predictable movement allows for greater control and precision in various applications.

A New Building Block for Artificial Skeletons

The flexure design is seen as a new building block that can be combined with other flexures to build any configuration of artificial skeletons. By fitting these skeletons with muscle tissues, engineers can create powerful, precise muscle-powered robots capable of performing a wide range of tasks.

Unlocking Muscle Potential

When left unattached in a petri dish, muscle tissue will contract, but not in a predictable or useful manner. By attaching muscle tissue between two small, flexible posts, engineers can create a muscle actuator. However, existing designs have shown limited movement due to the variable nature of muscle contractions.

The MIT team aimed to design a skeleton that could efficiently use the force generated by muscles, regardless of where and how they were placed on the skeleton. They theorized that if a muscle was to pull two posts together along a specific direction, the posts should be connected to a spring that only allows them to move in that direction when pulled.

The result is a soft and flexible device in one direction, yet stiff in all other directions. This design ensures that when a muscle",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineers-design-flexi.jpg,2024-04-08 14:34:04,"Meta Description: ""Discover a new spring-like device enhancing muscle-powered robots' efficiency & precision!

Blog Post:

Imagine a world where climbing robots can complete maintenance tasks on tall structures, deliver packages to hard-to-reach locations, or even save lives by providing survival kits in disaster-stricken areas. These scenarios are within reach, thanks to advancements in robotics and autonomous systems. However, for these robots to be successfully deployed in real-world settings, they must accurately sense and map their surroundings while predicting their location within these environments.

Researchers from Guangdong University of Technology have developed a new method to improve a bipedal climbing robot's ability to estimate its state and map its surroundings while climbing a truss. The proposed method, presented in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, is based on a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, specifically designed for a biped climbing robot (BiCR) developed by the team's Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab.

Biped Climbing Robot (BiCR)
BiCR is an electromechanical system that moves via grippers at both ends and rotates with multiple joints. It can be used for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and high-risk environments, such as construction site scaffolding and power towers.

BiCR-SLAM: A Novel SLAM Approach
The primary objective of the study was to enable a bipedal climbing robot to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures. The team's SLAM-based approach, called BiCR-SLAM, fuses robot joint information and environmental information to improve the localization accuracy of the BiCR.

The BiCR-SLAM framework consists of four components:
1. Encoder dead reckoning
2. LiDAR odometry estimation
3. Pole landmark mapping
4. Global optimization technique

BiCR-SLAM uses the BiCR robot's configuration, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras to localize the robot and map the truss it is climbing. This system can determine the pose of the robotic gripper and create a map of poles surrounding the gripper, allowing it",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-fusion-slam-system-t-1.jpg,2024-04-08 07:50:01,"Meta Description:

The realms of music and technology have always been intertwined, with the music industry continuously evolving to adapt to new technological advances. As we enter the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the industry must once again reinvent itself to address the latest challenges and opportunities.

One significant issue is the use of training data for large language models (LLMs). Paul McCabe, Vice President of R&D at Roland, emphasized the importance of responsible and equitable data usage, including appropriate compensation for the use of such data. While regulators will play a crucial role in enforcing compliance, it is equally important to garner grassroots support and advocate for updated copyright laws. This will ensure that GenAI and music can coexist harmoniously without stifering the adoption of new technology.

Throughout history, new technology has not replaced human involvement in music. Drum machines, for example, did not diminish the appeal of live drumming performances. Similarly, track recording did not replace orchestras, and music sampling has become an integral part of creating new sounds. GenAI holds the potential to benefit both musicians and the general public. Songwriters can explore new creative possibilities, and beginners can learn new instruments more easily with the help of natural language processing and conversational prompts.

Roland, a manufacturer of keyboards and drum machines, aims to create an AI-driven environment where music creators are equitably recognized and compensated for their work. In partnership with Universal Music Group, they have released ""Principles for Music Creation with AI,"" outlining a responsible approach to AI use in music creation, production, composition, and songwriting. These guidelines encompass seven core principles, emphasizing the importance of transparency and human creativity in AI.

Introduction

Green hydrogen has emerged as a promising clean energy carrier, attracting significant attention as a sustainable solution for the future. Among the various renewable energy sources available, solar energy has a distinct advantage due to its widespread availability and minimal reliance on natural topography. However, fluctuations in solar output and generation, resulting from factors like weather and season, can lead to repetitive power increases and decreases, potentially damaging the components of production devices.

To address this challenge, it is crucial to develop precise evaluation techniques for the durability of devices under power fluctuations, enabling optimal timing for component replacement and the advancement of new materials. In this article, we delve into a groundbreaking durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices, utilizing actual solar irradiance data with step durations as short as one second.

Evaluation Technique for Green Hydrogen Production Devices

The research team, led by Dr. Bora Seo from the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), has developed a cutting-edge durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices. This technique, applied with the shortest step duration among developed methods, accurately simulates fluctuations in actual solar energy output by using real solar irradiance data.

Until now, existing durability evaluation methods have not adequately reflected solar output variability, primarily relying on simple techniques like periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Moreover, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions.

The KIST research team has developed a simulation method that converts irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data obtained from solar panels and water electrolysis stack data. This innovative approach has dramatically shortened the step duration from 10 seconds to 1 second, allowing fluctuations in solar output to be accurately reflected.

In a groundbreaking study, a team of researchers led by Professor Sung-Kyun Jung from the School of Energy and Chemical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) has developed a novel method to enhance the stability of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). This breakthrough could pave the way for the creation of safer battery systems, addressing the long-standing issues of fire and explosion risks associated with conventional lithium-ion batteries.

The conventional lithium-ion batteries, which rely on organic liquid electrolytes, have been known to pose significant safety hazards due to their flammable nature. To overcome these challenges, the scientific community has been exploring ASSBs, which utilize non-flammable inorganic solid electrolytes. Among the promising materials for next-generation solid-state batteries are sulfide solid electrolytes. However, these materials have been plagued by thermal instability issues, which result from exothermic reactions and explosive decomposition products at the interface between sulfide solid electrolytes and electrode materials.

To tackle these challenges, the research team led by Professor Jung investigated the use of halide-based solid electrolytes as an alternative. By replacing sulfide solid electrolytes with halide counterparts, such as Li3InCl6, the team observed improved oxidation stability and reduced oxygen evolution from the cathode.

The team created a composite material combining Li3YCl6 (LIC) with a charged cathode material (Li1-xNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2), known as NCM622. The results showed that the halide-based solid electrolyte contributed to delaying the decomposition of NCM622 and suppressing combustible oxygen-gas evolution through an endothermic phase transition process.
