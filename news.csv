In the modern world, humans spend more time indoors, limiting their exposure to the sun's natural benefits. This has led to increased awareness of the sun's impact on serotonin production in the brain and its effects on our overall well-being.

Light therapy lamps have gained popularity as a way to mimic the sun's effects for those with limited sun exposure. However, these lamps often rely on the visible light spectrum, which may not be the most effective approach.

Recently, there has been growing interest in the use of near-infrared (NIR) light as a potential alternative to visible light therapy. NIR light falls between infrared and visible light on the spectrum and has shown promise in various medical applications.

At MWC, a Dutch company called Seaborough showcased small devices that utilize NIR light to combat seasonal affective disorder (SAD). These devices are designed to replace large SAD lamps, with one sitting next to the computer and the other clipping above the display.

These devices are still in the proof-of-concept stage, and the company is seeking partnerships to license the technology. The potential for integrating NIR light into laptops and webcams is being explored.

As someone who has struggled with depression, I am intrigued by the potential of NIR light therapy. While anecdotal evidence can be subjective, research suggests that NIR light may have positive effects on mood, drowsiness, and resting heart rate, particularly during winter months.

However, it's important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and applications of NIR light therapy.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/25/heck-might-as-well-put-the-back-of-your-phone-to-work/,"Heck, might as well put the back of your phone to work","

Have you ever thought about how much of your phone's back is just empty space? It's a vast, untapped canvas just begging to be utilized. Sure, there are the cameras, but what about the rest of that blank real estate? It's time for the back of our phones to start pulling its weight.

The idea of a secondary screen on the back of a phone isn't new. Yota Phone tried it a few years back, but the company sadly declared bankruptcy in 2019. Foldable devices have since taken center stage, making the dual-screen concept seem like a passing fad.

Enter the Infinix E-Color Shift, a phone that takes the dual-screen idea and adds a splash of color to the mix. But hold your horses, it's not quite the full-fledged secondary display we were promised. Instead, it's more of a fun aesthetic addition that's often hidden by a case, your hand, or a table.

The E-Color Shift's back panel isn't true e-ink, but it's close. Infinix describes the technology as a process where different voltages change the electric field within the microstructure, causing color particles to move and display desired colors. This allows the phone's back to change ""skins"" at will, all without consuming power.

I had a chance to play around with the E-Color Shift prototype at MWC in Barcelona. It's worth noting that this is still very much a work in progress. Not only is it not a finished product, but the tech Infinix was showcasing required the phone to be hooked up to an external battery pack.

Despite its limitations, the E-Color Shift's back panel does have one major advantage: it can hold a static image even when the battery isn't providing power. This means you can set a custom design or message on the back of your phone and it will stay there until you change it, even if your phone is turned off.

Whether this technology will ever make it to a commercial device remains to be seen. Infinix is likely hoping for the latter, but it's hard to imagine too many people buying a smartphone based solely on this feature. After all, it doesn't really do much beyond displaying a static image.

For now, the E-Color Shift remains a curiosity, a glimpse into what the future of phone design might hold. Will it ever become a mainstream feature? Only time will tell.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/26/a-psychologist-explains-the-beautiful-mess-effect-in-relationships/,A Psychologist Explains The ‘Beautiful Mess Effect’ In Relationships,"

In a world where perfection is often idealized, we tend to shy away from showing our vulnerabilities, fearing that they may be perceived as flaws. However, research reveals a fascinating phenomenon called the ""beautiful mess effect,"" which highlights the paradox of our vulnerability.

The beautiful mess effect suggests that while we may cringe at our own displays of vulnerability, others often view them positively. This discrepancy arises because we focus on the immediate discomfort and self-criticism associated with vulnerability, while observers see the courage, authenticity, and humility it embodies.

Vulnerability is not about being flawless; it's about embracing the imperfections and complexities that make us human. It's about acknowledging our fears, insecurities, and struggles, and allowing ourselves to be seen as we truly are.

Contrary to popular belief, people are drawn to those who are real and flawed, rather than those who project an illusion of perfection. Vulnerability and openness are essential for fostering meaningful relationships, as they create a space for emotional connection, acceptance, and growth.

When we are vulnerable, we give our partners the opportunity to witness our genuine selves, rather than a stoic facade. This authenticity deepens romantic bonds, leading to greater trust, satisfaction, and commitment.

Research also shows that vulnerability plays a crucial role in forgiveness. When partners are able to apologize sincerely and acknowledge their mistakes, they are more likely to be forgiven. This open communication fosters personal and relational growth.

Overcoming the beautiful mess effect requires self-compassion, which involves treating ourselves with kindness, understanding, and acceptance. Self-compassion allows us to approach our vulnerability with empathy, mitigating feelings of self-criticism and discomfort.

Self-compassion has three key components: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Self-kindness involves treating ourselves with the same care and compassion we would offer a friend. Common humanity reminds us that suffering and imperfection are part of the shared human experience, fostering a sense of connection and belonging. Mindfulness helps us stay present and aware of our thoughts and feelings without judgment.

Embracing vulnerability is not about seeking validation or approval from others. It's about recognizing the beauty in our imperfections and allowing ourselves to be authentically human. It's about creating connections that are built on honesty, acceptance, and mutual understanding.

So, let's shed the masks, embrace our beautiful messes, and allow ourselves to be seen and loved for who we truly are.

In the realm of human curiosity, where the pursuit of knowledge and truth ignites captivating discussions, a peculiar phenomenon emerges: the allure of conspiracy theories. These theories, often shrouded in suspicion and speculation, offer an intriguing glimpse into the darker recesses of our imagination.

Conspiracy theories take various forms, from whispers of shadowy organizations manipulating events to historic occurrences veiled in secrecy. They offer an alternative narrative, a tantalizing glimpse into a world where reality is perceived with a skeptical eye.

Research reveals six commonly believed conspiracy theories:

1. Government Malfeasance: These theories allege covert activities by governments, such as orchestrating attacks or faking disasters, to justify interventions or distract the public.

2. Malevolent Global Manipulation: Proponents argue that powerful groups, like the Illuminati, control world events to further their hidden agendas, such as establishing a New World Order.

3. Personal Well-being Control: These conspiracies suggest that corporations or governments use technologies to manipulate or harm individuals, aiming to control behavior or even alter thoughts and emotions.

4. Extraterrestrial Cover-ups: Believers contend that governments conceal the truth about extraterrestrial life, dismissing or suppressing reports of UFO sightings or alien encounters.

5. Control of Information: Theories suggest that organizations manipulate information to shape public perceptions, suppress dissent, or advance certain agendas, leading to distrust in official narratives and mainstream media.

6. Covid-19: A range of false claims surround the pandemic, including allegations of engineered viruses, bioweapons, or hoaxes for political and economic gain. These theories often question vaccine safety and promote harmful anti-vaccination sentiments.

While some may dismiss conspiracy theories as harmless, research highlights their potential detrimental effects. They can hinder preventive measures and treatment adherence, contribute to declining vaccination rates, and foster social and political disengagement.

To identify conspiracy beliefs, researchers developed the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale, which quantifies agreement with statements such as:

- The government is involved in the murder of innocent citizens and keeps it secret.
- Small, unknown groups control world politics, not heads of state.
- Secret organizations communicate with extraterrestrials but hide it from the public.
- The spread of certain diseases is the result of deliberate efforts by organizations.
- Groups of scientists manipulate evidence to deceive the public.

Understanding conspiracy theories and their potential impact on individuals and society is crucial. By fostering critical thinking and promoting evidence-based information, we can navigate the complexities of truth and reality with greater clarity and discernment.
