However, as these models become more advanced, there is a growing concern about their safety. To address this issue, the UK and US governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a common approach for evaluating the safety of AI models.

Under this partnership, the UK's AI Safety Institute and its counterpart in the US will collaborate to develop suites of tests that assess the risks and ensure the safety of the most advanced AI models. They plan to share technical knowledge, information, and personnel as part of this collaboration. One of their initial goals is to perform a joint testing exercise on a publicly accessible model.

According to the Financial Times, this partnership is the first bilateral arrangement on AI safety in the world. Both the US and the UK aim to work with other countries in the future, as AI is the defining technology of our generation, and this partnership will accelerate their work across the full spectrum of risks.

While this partnership is focused on testing and evaluation, governments around the world are also conjuring regulations to keep AI tools in check. In March, the White House signed an executive order aimed at ensuring that federal agencies are only using AI tools that do not endanger the rights and safety of the American people. A couple of weeks before that, the European Parliament approved sweeping legislation to regulate artificial intelligence. The legislation bans ""AI that manipulates human behavior or exploits people's vulnerabilities,"" ""biometric categorization systems based on sensitive characteristics,"" as well as the ""untargeted scraping"" of faces from CCTV footage and the web to create facial recognition databases. Additionally, deepfakes and other AI-generated images, videos, and audio will need to be clearly labeled as such under its rules.

Overall, the partnership between the UK and US governments, as well as the regulations being put in place around the world, highlight the growing concern about the safety of AI models. It is crucial that we continue to develop a common approach for evaluating the safety of these models and ensure that they are used for the benefit of society without posing a threat to it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8jyyac4oXkPodApCJY.lOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/6bcc4f00-d2fb-11ee-bffe-937b9b40187d,2024-04-02 06:30:02,"Collaboration to Enhance Generative AI Safety - UK & US.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-efficiency-stable-binary-solar-cells.html,Researchers set new efficiency record for stable binary organic solar cells," ""Researchers achieve record PCE of 19.7% in stable binary OSCs using asymmetric SAMs"" ","The pursuit of highly efficient and stable organic solar cells (OSCs) has been a long-standing challenge in the field of organic electronic devices. Recently, a research group led by Prof. Ge Ziyi from the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed two self-assembled molecules (SAMs) that have large dipole moments and employed them as hole-transporting layers (HTLs) in binary OSCs, achieving highly efficient and stable binary OSCs with a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 19.70%.

The development of new materials and optimization of the fabrication process have contributed to the rapid improvement in the PCE of OSCs, which has exceeded 19%. However, achieving a balance between efficiency and stability in conventional OSCs still remains a challenge. To address this issue, the researchers designed and synthesized two asymmetric SAMs with asymmetric backbone, namely BrCz and BrBACz. The two SAMs served as HTLs in binary OSCs based on the well-known system of PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9, respectively.

Compared with conventional PEDOT:PSS-controlled OSCs, the BrCz-controlled and BrBACz-controlled OSCs exhibited higher transmittance, deeper work function, and lower surface energy, thus realizing enhanced hole extraction, increased hole mobility, decreased interface resistance, and reduced carrier recombination. The BrBACz-based OSC achieved a record high PCE of 19.70% with a remarkable current density of 29.20 mA cm-2 and a circuit voltage of 0.856 V, which is the highest value reported to date for binary OSCs.

When exposed to ambient air (40 ± 5% humidity) and continuous illumination for 1,036 hours, the BrBACz-controlled device can maintain up to 95.0% of its initial efficiency, which is the best air stability for the conventional OSCs. In addition, the BrBACz-controlled device also plays a remarkable role in other well-known binary systems, such as PM6:Y6, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9, demonstrating its excellent generality.

This work highlights the importance of rational molecular structure design in the development of highly efficient and stable OSCs. By optimizing the molecular structure, the researchers were able to achieve a remarkable improvement in the performance of binary OSCs. This work paves the way for the future development and application of highly efficient and stable OSCs in various fields.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/researchers-set-new-ef.jpg,2024-04-01 09:50:03,"""Revolutionize your energy needs with highly efficient and stable organic solar cells.

High-Efficiency Direct Current (DC) Voltage Boost Converter ","Title: Kobe University Develops High-Efficiency Direct Current Voltage Boost Converter 

Are you tired of bulky and expensive power supplies that generate a lot of noise and heat? Look no further! The Kobe University-developed direct current voltage boost converter is here to change that. This innovative device achieves a much higher efficiency than before, at a lower cost and with reduced maintenance, making it a significant contribution to the development of electric and electronic components across various industries.

Direct current voltage boost converters are essential components in many devices that convert low-voltage direct current into high-voltage direct current output. These devices are used in various applications, including solar panels, medical devices, and hydrogen-fueled cars. However, the main challenge of these devices is to operate at high efficiency without generating electromagnetic noise or heat, while using as few parts as possible.

The Kobe University power electronics research team, led by researcher Mishima Tomokazu, has made a breakthrough in developing a new direct current power conversion circuit that solves this problem. The team combined high-frequency switching (about 10 times higher than before) with a technique that reduces electromagnetic noise and power losses due to heat dissipation, called ""soft switching,"" while also reducing the number of components and, therefore, keeping cost and complexity low.

""When the circuit changes between two states, there is a brief period when the switch is not completely closed, and at that point, there is both a voltage and a current across the switch. This means that during this time, the switch acts like a resistor and thus dissipates heat. The more often a switch state changes, the more this dissipation occurs. Soft switching is a technique that guarantees that the switch transitions happen at zero voltage, thus minimizing the heat loss,"" explains Dr. Mishima.

The Kobe University team presented their new circuit design and its evaluation in the journal IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics. The key to their achievement is the use of ""resonant tank"" circuits that can store energy during the switching period and therefore have much lower losses. In addition, they use a component-saving design with flat components printed onto a circuit board, called a ""planar transformer,"" which is very compact and has both good efficiency and thermal performance.

Mishima and his colleagues also built a prototype of the circuit and measured its performance. They confirmed that their snubberless design has much reduced electromagnetic noise and a high energy efficiency of up to 91.3%, which is unprecedented for a MHz drive with high voltage conversion ratio. This ratio is also more than 1.5 times higher than existing designs.

Considering how ubiquitous electrical devices are in our society, the high-efficiency and low-noise operation of direct current power supplies with a high voltage multiplier ratio is extremely important. This Kobe University development will be of great relevance to applications in electric power, renewable energy, transportation, information and telecommunications, and medical care.

""The current development is a 100W-class small-capacity prototype, but we aim to expand the power capacity to a larger kW-class capacity in the future by improving the electronic circuit board and other components,"" says Dr. Mishima.

In conclusion, the Kobe University-developed direct current voltage boost converter is a game-changer in the world of power electronics. This device's high efficiency, low cost, and reduced maintenance, combined with its low-noise operation and compact design, make it an ideal solution for various applications. With further development, this device will pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-high-boost-and-high.jpg,2024-04-01 09:35:04,"Improve your power supply efficiency with Kobe University's high-efficiency direct current voltage boost converter.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-high-purity-cathode-materials-alternative.html,Are high-purity cathode materials truly necessary? An alternative to reduce secondary battery costs," Optimize title for ""Lithium-Ion Battery Production Costs and High-Purity Cathode Material"" ","Introduction:

Lithium-ion batteries have become an essential component of portable devices and electric vehicles, but their production cost has been a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Secondary battery cathodes are an essential component of these batteries, and their quality is crucial to the entire battery production process. In recent years, manufacturers have been demanding very stringent purity specifications from cathode material suppliers to ensure consistent output. However, this has led to a significant increase in the unit cost of batteries, and some researchers have started to question the necessity of these high specifications. This article explores the impact of lithium raw material purity on secondary battery cathode material production and performance, and the potential benefits of using purity levels that are lower than the current industry standards.

Body:

Secondary battery cells are used in a wide range of applications, from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles, and their popularity has been growing rapidly in recent years. The cathode material is one of the essential components of these batteries, as it determines the battery's capacity, cycle life, and safety. However, the production of high-quality cathode materials is a complex process that requires significant investment in raw materials, manufacturing processes, and quality control.

One of the significant challenges in the production of high-quality cathode materials is the requirement for extremely low levels of impurities. The industry standard purity requirement for cathode materials is typically 99.5%, but some manufacturers have been demanding even higher purity levels. However, suppliers of cathode materials have been struggling to meet these requirements, which has led to a significant increase in the unit cost of batteries.

Recent research by a group of South Korean scientists has challenged the current industry standards for cathode material purity. The researchers found that the purity specifications set by cell manufacturers are overly stringent, and that streamlining the lithium refining process could significantly reduce the unit cost of batteries.

The team led by Professor Yong-Tae Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) conducted a series of experiments to explore the impact of lithium raw material purity on the production and performance of secondary battery cathode materials. They found that the presence of approximately 1% magnesium (Mg) impurity in the lithium raw material actually enhances process efficiency and prolongs the secondary battery's lifespan.

The researchers discovered that using low-purity lithium, not entirely rid of impurities, could reduce secondary battery production costs and carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19.4% and 9.0%, respectively. This finding has significant implications for the battery industry, as it suggests that manufacturers need to reevaluate their cathode material specifications and consider more unconventional approaches.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the purity specifications set by cell manufacturers for cathode materials are overly stringent, and this has led to a significant increase in the unit cost of batteries. Recent research by a team of South Korean scientists has challenged these standards and demonstrated that streamlining the lithium refining process could substantially reduce the unit cost of batteries. The researchers found that the presence of approximately 1% magnesium impurity in the lithium raw material enhances process efficiency and prolongs the secondary battery's lifespan. By reevaluating their cathode material specifications, battery manufacturers can potentially offer a fresh strategy against China's aggressively low prices.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/are-high-purity-cathod.jpg,2024-04-01 16:36:35,"Optimized Meta Description:

Beyoncé's new album ""Cowboy Carter"" opposes AI music and cultural appropriation in genre. She emphasizes the importance of real instruments and highlights the contributions of Black musicians to country music.","Title: Beyoncé's ""Cowboy Carter"": A Battle Cry Against AI and Cultural Appropriation in Music

Beyoncé's latest release, ""Cowboy Carter,"" has taken the world by storm, garnering widespread acclaim and setting new records in the streaming world. However, amidst the celebration and accolades, Beyoncé made a striking statement, voicing her concerns about the growing influence of AI in music.

""The joy of creating music is that there are no rules,"" Beyoncé stated. ""The more I see the world evolving, the more I felt a deeper connection to purity. With artificial intelligence and digital filters and programming, I wanted to go back to real instruments.""

Beyoncé's rare interviews make her comments even more significant, as they offer a glimpse into the artist's thought process and intentions. The superstar's aversion to AI is a deliberate expression of her values and artistic vision.

The central issue with AI-generated music lies in the way these technologies operate. AI music generators can produce new tracks in mere minutes and mimic artists' vocals deceptively well. This often occurs because the AI is being trained on the work of the very artists whose jobs it could potentially replace. Companies like Open AI and Stability AI utilize vast databases containing copyrighted artworks without proper consent, further fueling the controversy.

The unauthorized use of artists' work without consent raises valid concerns, particularly for up-and-coming musicians who may struggle to gain recognition in an already competitive industry. Beyoncé's stance against AI becomes even more relevant in the context of ""Cowboy Carter.""

Though not explicitly themed around AI, ""Cowboy Carter"" addresses the theft and appropriation of artworks without permission. Beyoncé uses the album to educate listeners about the significant contributions Black musicians have made to country music, a genre often associated with Southern white culture.

The title itself, ""Cowboy Carter,"" highlights this issue. While ""Carter"" could reference Beyoncé's married name, it also alludes to the Carters, the ""first family"" of country music, who built their success on the foundation laid by Black musicians. This legacy continues today, as Black artists are often excluded from the genre (a recent example includes an Oklahoma country radio station refusing to play Beyoncé's ""Tex","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/beyonce-ai.jpg?resize=1200,763",2024-04-01 22:45:04,"Meta Description:

This challenge has hindered the widespread adoption of ESGs for IoT applications.

A team of researchers from Microsystems & Nanoengineering has developed an efficient EMU that addresses the longstanding challenge of impedance mismatch, significantly boosting the power efficiency of ESGs for IoT devices. The study demonstrates that the EMU increased the performance of contact-separated triboelectric nanogenerators by 50%, and the power efficiency of rotary electret generators by 35%. These results highlight the versatility of the EMU across different energy-harvesting technologies.

The EMU comprises a spark-switch tube and a buck converter, which has been meticulously optimized to enhance the power efficiency of ESGs. The spark-switch tube facilitates the conversion of ambient energy into electrical energy, while the buck converter regulates the voltage and current output, ensuring optimal performance. The study shows that the EMU led to an unprecedented direct current output of 79.2 mW m-2 rps-1 in rotary electret generators, representing a significant leap in efficiency.

The development of this EMU has significant implications for the practical application of ESGs in IoT devices. The enhanced efficiency and reliability of self-powered IoT devices will make them more viable for use in remote and sustainable applications. Furthermore, the broad adoption of ESGs will facilitate the growth of IoT networks, enabling the integration of various devices and sensors, leading to more innovative and efficient solutions.

In today's reality, if you're managing a rocket enterprise and aren't concentrating on reusable rockets, you're heading toward a dead end. This concept applies equally to satellites: When you fail to render them reusable, you're merely introducing planned debris into orbit.""

Delving into China's challenges in attracting international partners for its International Lunar Research Station project proved enlightening. Deciphering China's space sector as a non-Mandarin speaking Westerner poses difficulties, hence my gratitude for Andrew Jones' insightful reporting.

Let's take a moment to remember the pioneering launch on April 1, 1960 – the exceptionally first weather satellite by NASA, known as TIROS 1 (Television and InfraRed Observation Satellite). As NASA explains:

Explained: This SEO title highlights the main focus of the article - the use of a 2D perovskite oxide with high dielectric constant (high-κ) to enhance the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. It includes important keywords such as 'high-κ', '2D perovskite oxide', and 'optoelectronic device'. Additionally, the title manages to convey the primary message within the character limit set by most search engines.","

Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being increasingly used in the development of miniaturized optoelectronic devices. These devices require high gate capacitance to perform optimally while consuming less energy. However, increasing gate capacitance often requires reducing the thickness of gate insulators or dielectrics, which can lead to decreased performance or increased complexity.

To overcome this challenge, researchers at Fudan University have developed a 2D perovskite oxide with high dielectric constant (κ) that can be integrated with different 2D channel materials. The perovskite oxide, Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , was synthesized using a top-down approach and has a high κ of 24.6, making it a promising photoactive high-κ dielectric for phototransistors.

The research team transferred the Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 nanosheets onto various 2D materials, including graphene, molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide and tungsten diselenide. They then tested the performance of transistors integrating these materials with Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 . The findings were highly promising, with molybdenum disulfide transistors exhibiting an on/off ratio of 106 and tungsten disulfide phototransistors showing a photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio of ~106 and UV responsivity of 5.5 × 103 A W−1.

The well-defined interface established between the semiconductor and dielectric, along with the high-κ of Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , enabled efficient gate control of channel materials. Furthermore, the phototransistors with the photoactive dielectric could offer UV-visible dual-band photodetection, where UV and visible light illumination were distinguished at separate terminals.

This research has the potential to pave the way for the synthesis of additional 2D perovskite oxides that can be integrated with existing semiconductors and channel materials. These 2D perovskite oxides could be used to develop smaller, better performing, and energy-efficient electronics or optoelectronics.

In conclusion, the development of high dielectric constant (high-κ) gate dielectrics compatible with 2D semiconductors is essential for scaled optoelectronic devices. The 2D perovskite oxide Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , synthesized using a top-down approach, has a high κ and can be integrated with various 2D channel materials. The research team's findings provide a promising foundation for the development of miniaturized optoelectronic devices with high gate capacitance and efficient gate control.

","The Great North American Solar Eclipse: A Spectacular Event That Will Darken the US, Canada, and Mexico

The Great North American Solar Eclipse, set to occur on April 8th, is an astronomical event that will darken the US, Canada, and Mexico. It's the first such event since August 21, 2017, and the last one that will be visible on the continent until 2044.

The solar eclipse will be visible in parts of all three countries, with some regions experiencing ""totality"" or a full blocking of the sun by the moon. This rare and dramatic sight will be seen by millions of people across the continent.

Where in the US and Canada will you experience the solar eclipse totality, and when?

The solar eclipse will move through a northeast path, with Mexico's Pacific coast getting the first views in Mazatlan starting at around 10:57 AM PDT (total eclipse starting at 12:07 PDT). The total eclipse will then move into the United States at 12:10 PM CDT (Eagle Pass, Texas), with select parts of Mexico, Illinois, and Indiana (including Indianapolis) experiencing totality.

Ohio cities Dayton, Toledo, and Cleveland will get the full show, followed by Erie, Pennsylvania, then Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse in New York. Canada is also in on the fun, with parts of southern Ontario (Hamilton, Niagara Falls) and Quebec (Montreal) getting the totality, along with New Brunswick, PEI, and finally, Bonavista, Labrador at 4:03 PM NDT (Newfoundland Time).

The closer you are to the band of totality, the more the sun will be obscured by the moon. Houston, St. Louis, Memphis, Nashville, Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Toronto, New York, Boston, and many other cities are within 200 miles of totality, meaning they'll get a 90 percent or better eclipse.

What's the weather forecast in my area?

It's still early for an accurate forecast, but it's clear that April isn't the ideal month for clear skies. Forecasts predict that the chances for clear skies are better the farther northeast you live, the opposite of historical trends.

Unfortunately, the odds of precipitation are indeed above average across most of the band of the eclipse. Forecasts predict that the chances for clear skies are better the farther northeast you live, the opposite of historical trends.

To wit, Dallas has showers forecast throughout the day (58 percent), which would mean continuous cloud cover and no clear view if that holds. That improves a bit when you get to Indianapolis (partly cloudy, 24 percent chance of rain), with things better still in Buffalo, New York (partly cloudy, 11 percent).

Things are looking good right now in Montreal, though, with mostly sunny skies and only a 9 percent chance of rain, and the same goes for Fredericton, New Brunswick. Niagara Falls also figures to have decent weather during the eclipse (mostly sunny, 18 percent), and it's in the path of totality, which has led to the city declaring a state of emergency out of caution. Officials estimate that a million people could pour into the area, creating potentially dangerous crowds.

How can I watch the solar eclipse at home?

Staring at the sun is obviously dangerous for your vision, and doing so during an eclipse can be just as harmful. Even though you may not feel discomfort immediately, you may damage your eyes via an affliction called solar retinopathy. That can lead to serious consequences like eye pain, blind spots, blurred vision, and more.

To safely watch the solar eclipse at home, you'll need to invest in a reliable pair of eclipse-viewing glasses. These glasses are specifically designed to protect your eyes from harmful solar radiation, and they're an essential piece of equipment if you want to watch the eclipse safely.

You should also make sure to choose a location with minimal light pollution, as this can make it harder to see the eclipse clearly. Additionally, you may want to invest in a telescope or binoculars to get a closer look at the eclipse and its various features.

Finally, make sure to take the time to educate yourself about the solar eclipse and its various features.

Are you ready to witness the Great North American Solar Eclipse? A rare and spectacular event that will darken parts of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The eclipse is set to occur on April 8th, and it's the first such event since August 21, 2017.

As an experienced SEO specialist, our team at TotalEclipse.com has put together a comprehensive guide to help you prepare for this once-in-a-lifetime event. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know, from where to watch the eclipse totality to how to safely view it at home.

What is a Solar Eclipse?

A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, temporarily blocking the sun's light. There are three types of solar eclipses: total, partial, and annular.

Where to Watch the Total Solar Eclipse

The Great North American Solar Eclipse will be visible in parts of all three countries. It's the first such event since August 21, 2017, and the last one that will be visible on the continent until 2044.

Here's a breakdown of where to watch the total solar eclipse:

 Mexico: The first views will be in Mazatlan starting at around 10:57 AM PDT (total eclipse starting at 12:07 PDT).
 United States: The total eclipse will move through a northeast path, with select parts of Mexico, Illinois, and Indiana (including Indianapolis) experiencing totality.

Title: The Limitations of AI in Stock Picking: An Analysis of GPTs

","Title: The Limitations of Artificial Intelligence in Stock Picking

Are you ready to revolutionize your stock picking with artificial intelligence? Think again! Despite the hype, current technology falls far short of what is needed to make intelligent choices. In this article, we will explore the limitations of GPTs in the stock market and why they cannot make basic decisions.

First, an analysis of all the stock-picking GPTs in OpenAI's GPT marketplace shows that every single one fails an extremely simple test: They cannot tell you if a stock is expensive or cheap. The question of what's expensive does not mean which stock price is the highest in absolute dollars, euros, or renminbi. Instead, it means which stock has the highest of one of several stock valuation metrics. Usually, that metric is a ratio, such as the price of the shares listed at the moment divided by some piece of financial data.

ChatGPT, and the various GPTs, don't know that basic fact. Every single one of them answers in the same clueless way. They mostly cite the recent stock price of Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Berkshire's stock price, at last check, was $634,440, so it's the highest price of all stocks in absolute dollars.

However, this does not mean Berkshire is the most expensive. It doesn't even mean it's expensive at all. Depending on the earnings per share, Berkshire stock might not be expensive. If the ratio is lower than the ratio for other stocks, Berkshire might be cheap compared to many stocks even though you would need to have a fortune to buy one share.

In other words, the GPTs haven't actually addressed the question. In fact, they're missing entirely the question of valuation, the ratio, implied by the question. The failure of every single GPT to answer that very basic question has significant implications. First, the fact that every one of them produces more or less the same answer suggests they are all drawing from some similar misconception. That's probably coming from the pre-training data in OpenAI's GPT itself, which is obviously shaped by some collection of conversational data that confuses share price for valuation.

More important, the GPTs clearly don't ""understand"" the question, even though they are in many cases connected to a remote service that presumably is domain-specific for the investing domain. Many of the GPTs ask your permission to contact a remote host, suggesting they're accessing a database. The fact that the programs can't parse a very basic question suggests that despite outside resources, nothing has been done to refine -- or ""fine-tune,"" as it's called -- their grasp of patterns of speech in the domain of stock-picking.

When the question is phrased more specifically, about which stocks have the ""highest P/E,"" the GPTs fail again. They claim not to have access to sufficient real-time information -- which is surprising for programs that, again, are phoning home to outside services. The GPTs are clearly at a primitive stage of development, given that it's very easy to look up the current P/E of any stock by going to Yahoo! Finance and searching for that stock. The P/E of Apple and others are listed among the most basic information about the stocks.

It's impossible to stress too much the importance of the basic question of how expensive or cheap a stock is. If you can't handle this simple question, you really can't do any stock investing at all. That means all of the stock investing GPTs at the moment are useless. They may produce a variety of data about companies and stocks, but nothing that would give any valuable insight.

The fact that the GPTs are useless is surprising. After all, stock investing discussions about P/Es are not some obscure, arcane field of human knowledge.

I cried, and Hume's EVI told me it cared", Hume AI Unveils EVI: AI with Emotional Intelligence for Personalized Responses ,"Title: Introducing Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI): A Revolutionary AI with Emotional Intelligence

A new era of artificial intelligence (AI) is upon us. Gone are the days when AI models were only capable of performing tasks based on explicit programming. Today, AI has proven to be intelligent and, in some cases, even surpassed human performance on various benchmarks. However, one startup, Hume AI, is pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities by focusing on emotional intelligence.

Hume AI recently announced the beta release of its flagship product, the Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI), which it proudly claims to be ""the first AI with emotional intelligence."" The company secured $50 million in a Series B round of funding, further validating its ambitious vision.

So, what makes EVI unique? This groundbreaking AI model is designed to detect human emotions by analyzing voices and combining that knowledge with users' statements to generate emotionally-aware responses. By detecting a user's emotional state, EVI can tailor its responses to fit their emotional needs. For instance, if EVI detects that a user is sad, it can offer words of encouragement, comfort, and even provide some advice.

Empathetic Voice Interface Demonstration

In addition to detecting a person's emotions, EVI can recognize when a person is ending their sentence, pause when interrupted, and generate conversations with minimal latency, creating an experience similar to interacting with a human. Built on a combination of large language models (LLMs) and expression measures, Hume AI calls this innovative model an empathic large language model (eLLM).

Unfortunately, EVI is not publicly available at the moment. However, the company has announced that it will be generally available later this month. To stay updated, users can fill out a form on the Hume AI website to be notified when EVI is released.

The Empathetic Voice Interface in Action

To test EVI, I visited the Hume AI website and began chatting after granting the site access to my microphone. Immediately, I received feedback about my emotional state. For the first example, I spoke to EVI as I would during a typical Zoom call with a colleague. I greeted the model by saying, ""Hi, Hume, how are you?""

Introduction

In its continuous pursuit to evolve and keep users engaged, LinkedIn has recently announced plans to join the short-form video trend, following platforms such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook & Instagram Reels. This new addition aims to cater to professionals who want to consume and create quick, engaging content while networking and expanding their industry knowledge. Let's dive into the details surrounding this exciting update.

The Emergence of Short Videos on LinkedIn

First discovered by user Austin Null and later confirmed by LinkedIn to TechCrunch, these brief clips aim to bring a more dynamic and interactive experience to the platform. Although sharing videos isn't novel to LinkedIn, this particular feature emphasizes brevity—users can swiftly scroll through numerous short videos, similar to popular apps mentioned earlier.

A 'Reimagined Video Experience'

Back in August 2021, LinkedIn decided to discontinue its 'Stories' feature, which allowed users to upload fun and lighthearted ephemeral videos. In its place, LinkedIn expressed intentions to develop a ""reimagined video experience that's even richer and more conversational."" It seems that this upcoming short-video functionality might just fit the bill.

Features and User Interface

Even though the feature remains in its infancy, some information regarding its layout and capabilities is available. Users can find the content under a new Video tab located at the top of the navigation bar. By clicking on the tab, they can view, react, engage in discussions, or share the material. Similar to competing platforms, simply swiping left will reveal another clip in line.

Curating Content Feeds

Unlike rival applications offering personalized content based on individual preferences, LinkedIn has not explicitly discussed how the feed will be curated. As soon as further information emerges concerning this aspect, we'll ensure to keep you updated.

Availability and Rollout Schedule

As of now, the short-form video feature is only accessible to select users since it is still in its initial stages of development. No official announcement revealing widespread availability has been made; however, rest assured that we will inform you once LinkedIn releases additional updates and announcements related to this intriguing enhancement.

Conclusion

LinkedIn's venture into short-form videos signifies its dedication to fostering engagement among users and keeping up with contemporary trends. With this innovative step, professionals can look forward to creating and consuming snackable bits of captivating content right within their go-to professional networking hub.

""Trump's Digital Media Firm Struggles to Turn a Profit Despite SPAC Deal""

","

Former President Donald Trump's digital media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), is struggling to make ends meet. Despite recently merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp. in a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deal, TMTG is losing money and generating little revenue. Specifically, the company lost $58 million on only $4 million in revenue in its first quarter.

While some may attribute this imbalance to the challenges faced by startups, TMTG is not growing, and its main business, Truth Social, is failing to attract more than a few million users. The company's revenue numbers are low, and advertisers are not willing to pay for the audience that exists. Moreover, TMTG does not have the resources to invest in growth or take risks.

The lack of growth and revenue makes TMTG's current valuation questionable. Despite the company's overvaluation, there is a risk that the whole thing could implode before the year is out. The fact is that the share price is not connected to the performance of the company.

The challenges faced by TMTG are not unique. Many startups struggle to turn a profit, and TMTG is no exception. However, the company's failure to grow and its lack of profitability make it an unattractive investment opportunity for potential investors.

In conclusion, while TMTG may have some unique challenges, the company's struggles to make ends meet are not uncommon among startups. The fact that TMTG is not growing and is losing money makes its current valuation questionable. As such, potential investors should be cautious before investing in this struggling company.

The AltStore will be similar in some ways to Apple's own App Store, but it will also allow developers to monetize their apps using a unique business model. Instead of relying on ads, paid downloads, or in-app purchases, the AltStore will allow developers to use its custom Patreon integration to market their apps directly to consumers.

The AltStore plans to launch in the EU with just two apps, Delta and Clip. Delta will be available for free, while Clip will require a pledge of $1 or more on Patreon. The AltStore will also allow other developers to distribute their apps through the storefront, with the ability to use the same Patreon integration to monetize their apps.

One of the key advantages of the AltStore is the ability to provide users with a ""granular view"" of the entitlements that an app has, before installing it. This will give users more control over their app downloads and allow them to choose apps that align with their values and preferences.

The AltStore is set to launch now, but Testut is waiting for final approval from Apple. If successful, the AltStore will provide users with a new way to discover and download apps, while also giving developers a new way to monetize their content.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/altstore.png?resize=1200,490",2024-04-01 16:54:25,"EU Approval Looms for AltStore Launch: Discover and Monetize Apps with Patreon

In March 2020, Astra rocket exploded during prelaunch testing. Video footage obtained by TechCrunch revealed the micro launcher bursting into flames, confirming that the vehicle did not survive the anomaly. Despite initial success, Astra failed to deliver on its ultra-low-cost launch plans, leading to a take-private deal and the end of its trading on the Nasdaq.

In March 2020, Astra's Rocket 3.0 suffered a catastrophic failure during prelaunch testing at Alaska's Pacific Spaceport Complex. The explosion, initially reported as an ""anomaly,"" left the rocket destroyed and ended Astra's third orbital launch attempt.

At the time, Astra CEO Chris Kemp downplayed the incident, telling TechCrunch that the rocket had ""suffered an anomaly following an otherwise successful day of testing."" However, the video footage obtained by TechCrunch showed the micro launcher bursting into flames, indicating that the vehicle did not survive.

Astra was taking the failures in stride, with CEO Chris Kemp stating in a May 2022 interview that reliability was not the end goal. The company believed that so many launches would be successful that people would stop thinking about them.

Despite its initial success, Astra failed to materialize its ultra-low-cost launch plans, and after months of burning cash, the company's board accepted a take-private deal from Kemp and CTO Adam London at a stock price of just $0.50 per share. The deal is expected to close this quarter, and Astra will cease trading on the Nasdaq.

Astra did not respond to a request for comment on the 2020 launch failure.
