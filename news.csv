As Warren explains, ""Our goal is to demonstrate an integrated device that harvests and stores energy efficiently, making it ideal for the Internet of Things and distributed sensor networks."" With no requirement for manual charging, PECs offer distinct advantages over existing batteries.

How It Works:
Pyroelectrochemical cells rely on changing environmental temperatures to produce an electric field. When subjected to fluctuating temperatures—be it indoors, outdoors, underground, or aboard vehicles like cars and airplanes—the PEC generates an electric charge. Within the cell, a proprietary pyroelectric composite material functions as the separator responsible for storing energy in the form of an electric double layer. Ions move between positively and negatively charged layers based on variations in temperature, effectively creating a high-capacity capacitor.

Testing the Theory:
Warren's lab conducted extensive testing to validate their hypothesis regarding the operation of pyroelectrochemical cells. They examined factors such as the impact of altering the separator's orientation and differences between heating versus cooling cycles. These tests confirmed their predictions, paving the way for further optimization aimed at enhancing overall performance.

Future Prospects:
While promising results have emerged from laboratory trials, real-world implementation poses additional challenges. To tackle these obstacles, one of Warren's students is currently engaged in designing a functional prototype using advanced circuit modeling techniques. By adjusting critical parameters, the team aims to maximize the efficiency and reliability of future PEC iterations.

Conclusion:
As the Internet of Things continues to expand, so does the demand for efficient, eco-friendly solutions tailored explicitly for IoT devices. Pyroelectrochemical cells represent a groundbreaking stride towards fulfilling this objective. Drawing inspiration from nature, scientists have created a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional batteries.

Imagine vast, porous sandstone reservoirs, once filled with oil and natural gas, now housing a different kind of carbon-free fuel - hydrogen. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are utilizing computer simulations and lab experiments to determine if depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs can be used for storing this clean fuel.

Hydrogen, a vital clean fuel, can be produced by splitting water using solar or wind power. It can generate electricity, power heavy industry, and fuel vehicles. Moreover, hydrogen can be stored for months and used during periods when energy demand exceeds the supply from renewable energy sources.

Matthew Paul, a Sandia National Laboratories geosciences engineer, works on a gas adsorption system in a fume hood as part of a project to see if depleted petroleum reservoirs can be used for storing carbon-free hydrogen fuel. Credit: Craig Fritz
Tuan Ho, a chemical engineer at Sandia, leading the research, explains, ""Hydrogen would be ideal for seasonal and long-term storage. During summers, excess solar energy can be converted into hydrogen and stored until winter when heating needs are high.""

The challenge lies in the fact that hydrogen contains less energy per volume than carbon-based fuels like natural gas or propane, making it harder to compress. Storing large quantities of hydrogen in surface tanks is unfeasible. Although hydrogen can be stored underground in salt caverns, such geological formations are not widespread in the United States.

Consequently, Ho's team is investigating whether hydrogen stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs will become trapped in the rock, leak out, or become contaminated.

The researchers explored whether hydrogen would adhere to the sandstone or shale forming the bodies and seals of many oil and gas reservoirs or permeate through them. Sandstone is composed of compressed grains of minerals and rocks, with gaps between particles suitable for storing water in aquifers or forming oil and gas reservoirs. Shale, made up of smaller clay-rich mineral particles, can form a seal around sandstone and trap it.

Introduction

Have you ever wondered how your interactions with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, can influence their responses? As users, we often modify our prompts to obtain desired outputs, but what consequences do these changes have on the model's accuracy? A team of researchers from the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute (USC ISI) decided to investigate this intriguing topic. In their study, published on the preprint server arXiv, they discovered that slight modifications in prompts can significantly affect LLM predictions. Let's explore their fascinating findings.

Four Categories of Prompt Variations

The researchers examined four distinct categories of prompt variations:

1. Requested responses in specific output formats (e.g., lists, CSV).
2. Minor perturbations to the prompt itself, such as adding extra spaces or using polite phrases.
3. Jailbreaks, designed to bypass content filters for sensitive topics.
4. Offering tips for improved responses.

Testing Across Benchmark Text Classification Tasks

To assess the impact of various prompt designs, the researchers conducted tests on eleven benchmark text classification tasks. These tasks involved categorizing or labeling text data according to their content or meaning. Some examples include toxicity classification, grammar evaluation, humor detection, sarcasm identification, and mathematical proficiency assessment.

Key Findings

The investigation yielded several noteworthy results:

1. Formatting matters: Altering the output format alone caused a minimum of 10% of predictions to change. Even something as simple as specifying a particular format had a considerable influence on model performance.
2. Subtle adjustments matter too: While less dramatic than output format changes, minor perturbations, such as adding spaces or inserting common greetings, also resulted in numerous prediction shifts.
3. Jailbreaks vary widely: Using jailbreaks produced a higher proportion of changes compared to other methods, albeit with inconsistent outcomes depending on the chosen technique.
4. No one-size-fits-all solution: Accuracy varied among the tasks, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches rather than adopting universal formatting or perturbation methods.
5. Tipping isn't everything: Contrary to popular belief, providing tips barely affected LLM accuracy. Instead, experimenting with jailbreaks proved more influential in terms of performance changes.

Conclusion

These discoveries shed light on the complex interplay between user inputs and LLM responses. By understanding how prompt variations influence predictive outcomes, developers can optimize interaction designs, fine-tune models, and create more accurate LLMs. Future studies may further elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for these phenomena and help identify new best practices for harnessing the potential of advanced AI systems.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/chatgpt-1.jpg,2024-04-08 13:20:02,"""Discover how prompt variations affect large language models; format, subtle changes, & jailbreaks impact predictions.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-bessy-ii-pulsed-batteries.html,BESSY II: How pulsed charging enhances the service time of batteries," Pulsed Current Charging Doubles Lithium-Ion Battery Lifespan, Study Finds ","Title: Revolutionizing Battery Lifespans: The Power of Pulsed Current Charging

In today's world, lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous, employed in everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. Despite their widespread use, these batteries suffer from gradual capacity decline throughout numerous charge cycles. To tackle this issue, researchers delved into the impact of charging protocols on battery lifespan, discovering that conventional charging methods may not be optimal.

Leading this groundbreaking study, Professor Philipp Adelhelm's team at HZB and Humboldt-University Berlin collaborated with experts from the Technical University of Berlin and Aalborg University in Denmark. Their findings reveal that alterations in how we charge our batteries can lead to substantial improvements in longevity—up to twice the standard cycle life in some cases. Let's explore the fascinating science behind this innovation!

Conventional vs. Pulsed Current Charging:

Typically, lithium-ion batteries undergo consistent current flow during the charging process. But, as Adelhelm's research demonstrates, there exists a superior alternative known as pulsed current (PC) charging. When compared to traditional constant current (CC) charging, PC charging results in a thinner solid electrolyte interface (SEI), thereby preserving battery capacity. Additionally, PC charging minimizes destructive cracks in both NMC532 (cathode) and graphite (anode) structures, further enhancing overall performance.

To validate these claims, two sets of batteries were tested at Aalborg University: one using CC charging and another employing PC charging. After multiple charge cycles, post-mortem analysis exposed striking variances. Notably, the SEI layer in CC-charged batteries exhibited significant thickness, hindering efficiency. Meanwhile, those subjected to PC charging displayed diminished cracking and a thinner SEI layer, contributing to better performance.

Illuminating Insights Through Synchrotron Experiments:

Further examination transpired through intricate investigative techniques, including operando Raman spectroscopy and dilatometry, along with X-ray absorption spectroscopy at Humboldt University and BESSY II. These probed the inner workings of lithium-ion cells when utilizing varying charging protocols. Complementary studies took place at PETRA III, bolstering the evidence base.

Dr. Yaolin Xu, leading the experimental efforts, summarized the benefits of pulsed current charging. By promoting uniform lithium ion diffusion across graphite particles, PC charging mitigates mechanical strain and particle fracturing, ultimately fortifying the structural integrity of the graphite anode. Furthermore, PC charging impedes detrimental modifications in NMC532 cathode materials, such as reduced nickel-oxygen bond length variations.

Optimizing Frequency for Peak Performance:

While the merits of PC charging are indisputable, its implementation requires careful consideration. Specifically, the frequency of pulsed current plays a critical role in maximizing benefits. High-frequency PC charging protocols, characterized by square-wave current patterns, yield impressive outcomes. Indeed, in this particular study, a remarkable enhancement occurred: commercial LIBs endured double the typical cycle life when harnessing optimized high-frequency PC charging protocols.

Professor Dr. Julia Kowal, a prominent figure in electrical energy storage technology at TU Berlin, expressed her enthusiasm about the potential advantages of pulsed charging. She noted, ""[It] could offer considerable gains regarding the stability of electrode materials and interfaces, subsequently extending the lifetimes of batteries."" As researchers continue advancing battery technologies, innovations like pulsed current charging will undoubtedly remain at the forefront of scientific discovery.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/bessy-ii-how-pulsed-ch.jpg,2024-04-09 11:04:56,"Optimize Your Batteries with Pulsed Current Charging - Double Cycle Life!

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous, playing a crucial role in various fields, from robotics to economics. However, their inherent complexity makes mathematical modeling and control a challenging task. To address this issue, researchers often turn to the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system, which uses fuzzy logic to approximate nonlinear systems as multiple linear systems, making them easier to manage.

The T–S fuzzy system has paved the way for several nonlinear control methods, with the Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC) method being the most prominent. In an effort to further enhance the T–S fuzzy system, scientists have developed the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS), which combines the T–S fuzzy system with the powerful space-state representation, resulting in a more robust and versatile control method.

Despite extensive research, optimal control strategies in the context of T–S FDSs remain largely unexplored. To tackle this limitation, a team of researchers, led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, developed novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model.

To create these controllers, the team first used the Lyapunov stability theory to establish stability conditions for the FDS mathematical model. However, these stability conditions cannot be directly used for solving. To overcome this hurdle, the researchers transformed the stability conditions into Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), making them more solvable.

Using these modified conditions as a foundation, the team developed three controllers: the stability controller, the optimal controller, and the robust-optimal controller. The stability controller uses PDC to manage deviations, while the optimal controller minimizes a cost function to achieve optimal control. The robust-optimal controller combines the benefits of both, resulting in a more adaptable and efficient control method.

The researchers tested the performance of these controllers in controlling a rotary inverted pendulum, which comprises an inverted pendulum on a rotating base. The goal is to keep the pendulum upright by controlling the rotation of the base.

Simulation results revealed that the stability controller effectively stabil",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-robust-optimal-c.jpg,2024-04-08 11:32:04,"""Discover how Fuzzy Descriptor System improves nonlinear control!
