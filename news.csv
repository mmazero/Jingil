https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Climate change could cost Texans outdoor time by 2080"" - MIT tool ","Climate change is a difficult concept to make relatable, and researchers at MIT might have just the solution. They have developed a tool that allows people to see how many “outdoor days” their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked. The results might be alarming or comforting, depending on where you live.

For people in California, France, and Germany, the climate won’t be quite as hospitable in the summers, but it’ll grow a little bit more clement in the spring and fall, adding anywhere from a few days to nearly a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records. The UK will be even better off, gaining 40 outdoor days by the end of the century.

However, some temperate places like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. Elsewhere, the picture looks even more dire. Illinois will lose more than a month of outdoor days by the 2080s as the summers grow unbearably hot. Texas will lose a month and a half for the same reason.

The countries with some of the most vulnerable populations will suffer the most. Nigeria’s summers will grow even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India will lose almost two and a half months.

Assessing risk

The MIT tool is a relatable application of a field of study known as climate scenario analysis, a branch of strategic planning that seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. It’s not a new field, but as advances in computational power have fostered more sophisticated climate models, it has become more broadly applicable than before.

A range of startups are using this relatively newfound predictive capability to help give shape to an uncertain future. Many startups in the space are focused on tackling that uncertainty for investors, lenders, and insurers. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on those markets, supplying customers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. The startups also determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought, and they’ll deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains. They can also crank out regulatory disclosures, highlighting relevant climate risks.

Investors and insurers are sufficiently worried about how climate change will affect assets and supply chains that these startups have attracted some real cash. Jupiter intelligence has raised $97 million, while Cervest has raised $43 million and One Concern has brought in $152 million.

While major financial institutions are an obvious customer base for climate forecasting companies, other markets exposed to the outdoors are also in need of solutions. ClimateAI is targeting agriculture, including agribusiness, lenders, and food and beverage companies, all of which have watched as droughts, floods, and storms have decimated crops. As a result, water risk assessment is a key feature of ClimateAI’s forecasts, though it provides other weather and climate related data, too. The startup has raised $37 million so far.

Sensible Weather is working on markets that are a little closer to home for most of us. It provides insurance for people embarking on outdoor events and activities, from live concerts to camping and golfing. It works with campgrounds, golf courses, live event operators, and more, allowing them to give customers an option to insure their outing against inclement weather. It’s an approach that’s landed the startup $22 million in funding.

As more businesses and consumers become aware of how climate change is affecting their lives, their demand for certainty will create a wealth of new markets that will offer these startups and their peers ample opportunity to expand. Climate scenario analysis, once a niche limited to academic labs and insurance companies, appears poised to enter the mainstream.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"""Assess your outdoor risks with MIT's climate tool - Get insights on how many outdoor days you'll experience in the future!

This feature is designed to create a personalized feed of Reels for a user and their friend, based on Reels they have shared with each other and their interests. The feature is similar to Spotify's Blend feature, which allows two people to combine their favorite songs into one shared playlist.

The screenshot shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi shows that Blend will be a private feature between the two users and they can leave it at any time. Instagram hasn't shared any specific details about the feature, such as whether it will continuously update with new recommendations or if it will be updated after a certain amount of time.

The goal of the feature is to help users discover new Reels together and boost Reels' discovery and watch time. Since people already send each other Reels via DMs, Instagram is now using that data to proactively recommend and display Reels that it believes a pair of users will enjoy. 

If released, Blend would give Instagram Reels users access to a fun and collaborative feature that isn't available on its rival platform, TikTok. Although the two products are quite similar, the introduction of ""Blend"" could give Instagram a slight competitive edge over TikTok, albeit a small one considering TikTok continues to largely dominate the short-form video market.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-credo-for-the-ai-age-always-be-modernizing/,IT's credo for the AI age: Always be modernizing," ""Modernize IT Infrastructure for AI, Edge, Security and Sustainability""","The world of technology is constantly evolving, and as new innovations emerge, so too must the way we operate and manage our IT systems. One of the latest trends is the move towards hybrid and multi-cloud services, as organizations look to modernize their IT infrastructure to support AI, edge systems, security, and sustainability.

According to a recent survey by Nutanix, adoption of hybrid and multicloud clouds is expected to double over the next one to three years, as CIOs and IT leaders look to reduce complexity and costs while supporting these new initiatives. The survey also shows that IT modernization is a top priority for many organizations, with AI and IT modernization being the top two priorities for the year.

The connection between AI and IT modernization is clear, as AI requires a scalable and flexible infrastructure to support its needs. This is why many organizations are investing in hybrid cloud strategies that allow them to manage and run applications and data across multiple environments, including the cloud, data center, and edge environments.

To successfully navigate this new wave of IT infrastructure modernization, organizations must prioritize collaboration and engagement with their teams. Modernization is not just about adopting new tools and technologies, but about using them to drive value for the business. This means taking a long-term perspective and approaching modernization as an ongoing process that leverages the best of what the organization already has and takes it to the next level.

In addition to AI, edge computing is also taking center stage as a technology investment area in 2024. At least 90% of executives seek to strengthen their edge strategies, and 72% will be pouring more money into related technologies, such as additional server capacity, network gear, readers, or sensors.

However, the challenge to moving to the cloud is that ""lift-and-shift"" approaches can be clunky. More than one third of IT executives, 35%, say workload and application migration is a significant challenge given their current IT infrastructure. To address this, there is an increased demand for application containerization, which can serve as workarounds to supporting both legacy and more modern environments.

In conclusion, the world of technology is changing rapidly, and organizations must adapt to stay competitive. This means investing in the latest trends, such as hybrid and multicloud services, AI, and edge computing, while also prioritizing collaboration and engagement with their teams.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/4a21d44d2c9a7875f214cd3349a207aaea708e1a/2024/03/29/f6628a42-8a5b-480c-ac6e-5fa4c794911a/hongkong-gettyimages-1159521351.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-29 00:00:00,Optimize your IT infrastructure for AI and edge computing with hybrid cloud strategies.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-reversibility-specific-capacity-iron-based.html,"Researchers improve reversibility, specific capacity of iron-based phosphate cathodes for Na-ion batteries",Researchers improve reversibility of iron-based phosphate cathodes for Na-ion batteries.,"

Iron-based phosphate cathodes are a promising option for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) due to their low cost and long lifespan. However, the maricite phase of NaFePO4 (NFP) is usually electrochemically inert due to the absence of effective Na+ ion diffusion channels, while Na 2 FeP 2 O 7 shows open three-dimensional Na+ channels but low theoretical capacity with air instability. In contrast, Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP-4.0) allows a high theoretical capacity of ~130 mA h g-1 and 3.1 V-level output as well as good air stability, making it an attractive option for NIBs. However, the practical reversible capacity of NFPP-4.0 is restricted to the 110 to 120 mA h g-1 range due to structural defects, which is far lower than its theoretical value.

Researchers led by Prof. Zhao Junmei from the Institute of Process Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently reported an effective strategy to improve the reversible capacity and energy density of iron-based phosphate cathodes through the activation of the inert NFP phase. The study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on March 28. The researchers proposed incorporating the maricite NFP phase into the NFPP-4.0 host to create iron-based phosphates with more active Fe2+ contents based on the formation of heterogeneous structure. The final optimized Na 4.5 Fe 3.5 (PO 4 ) 2.5 (P 2 O 7 ) cathode (i.e., NFPP-4.5; the mole ratio of NFP/NFPP-4.0 is 0.5:1) enables full activation of the inert NFP and delivers a reversible capacity of over 130 mA h g-1, thereby increasing the energy density to 400 W h kg-1, which is close to the highest energy density of iron-based polyanionic cathodes used in NIBs.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that NFPP-4.5 is composed of a bi-phase intergrowth heterogeneous structure based on the NFP and NFPP-4.0 phases, in which the NFP nanodomains are distributed in the continuous NFPP-4.0 matrix, thus generating compatible and percolating interfaces. Such two-phase interfaces can trigger Na+ transportation in the NFP nanodomains, contributing to its electrochemical activation in the composite cathodes. In situ XRD also confirmed that NFP undergoes amorphization transition upon its first charging and maintains this amorphous nature in following cycles, which is key to achieving the high capacity of NFPP-4.5 with the activation of inert NFP.

The practical application of NFPP-4.5 was validated by the scale-up synthesis of kg-level products and pouch cells, revealing desirable fast-charge capability and superior cycling performance. When charged at 5 C (i.e., five times the battery charging capacity, implying a relatively high charging current), the reversible capacities of the pouch cells still maintained 80% retention compared to 0.1 C (i.e., 0.1 times the battery charging capacity). The pouch cells demonstrated an excellent capacity retention of more than 88% after cycling at 3 C (i.e., three times the battery charging capacity) 2,000 times, demonstrating huge application prospects.

This work provides guidance on developing low-cost, high-performance polyanion cathodes that can be used in NIBs.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/openai-custom-voice-engine-preview/,"OpenAI built a voice cloning tool, but you can’t use it… yet"," ""OpenAI builds voice cloning tool, but no public release yet""","By OpenAI's standards, the Voice Engine is not a deepfake, it's a tool for synthesizing voice. And while there are no plans to make it available to the public, the tech giant is working hard to ensure it's used responsibly.

For years, OpenAI has been developing its Voice Engine, which allows users to upload any 15-second voice sample and generate a synthetic copy of that voice. But before the model is released to the public, the company wants to ensure that everyone feels good about how it's being deployed, and that they have mitigations in place to prevent abuse.

The Voice Engine model is powered by the same technology that underpins other OpenAI products, such as the voice and ""read aloud"" capabilities in ChatGPT and the preset voices available in the text-to-speech API. Spotify has also been using the technology to dub podcasts in different languages.

But training the model has been a little touchy subject. Harris would only say that the Voice Engine model was trained on a mix of licensed and publicly available data. However, OpenAI has been sued over allegations that they violated IP law by training their AI on copyrighted content, including photos, artwork, code, articles, and e-books, without providing the creators or owners credit or pay.

OpenAI has licensing agreements in place with some content providers and allows webmasters to block their web crawler from scraping their site for training data. However, they do not offer an opt-out scheme for other products. OpenAI suggests that it's ""impossible"" to create useful AI models without copyrighted material, asserting that fair use shields them where it concerns model training.

Surprisingly, Voice Engine isn't trained or fine-tuned on user data. Instead, it generates speech by analyzing speech data and text data meant to be read aloud. The audio that's used is dropped after the request is complete, making it an ephemeral way to generate speech.

The model is not novel tech, as a number of startups and Big Tech incumbents have delivered voice cloning products for years. However, Harris claims that OpenAI's approach delivers overall higher-quality speech.

With rising geopolitical tensions and potential restrictions on Chinese merchants, TikTok's focus on e-commerce and its growing popularity among younger consumers could make it a formidable contender in the space. However, the uncertainty surrounding ByteDance's ability to operate in the US raises questions about the sustainability of TikTok's e-commerce ambitions.

As TikTok continues to grow its e-commerce platform, it's important to note that it's not the only alternative marketplace for sellers to expand their customer bases. Other platforms like Temu are also gaining attention from Chinese e-commerce exporters and merchants. Amazon is reportedly taking notice of these alternatives, further evidence that the e-commerce landscape is becoming more competitive.

While TikTok has already launched its e-commerce platform with over 200,000 merchants on board, it has not provided any updated numbers on its current user base or sales figures. However, Jungle Scout found that 20% of Amazon sellers, brands, and businesses have plans to expand to TikTok Shop this year. Before the current political backlash took off, ByteDance reportedly projected that it could grow its US e-commerce business tenfold to $17.5 billion this year.

Despite these promising figures, the political tensions between the US and China continue to loom over TikTok's e-commerce ambitions.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/att-reset-account-passcodes-customer-data/,AT&T resets account passcodes after millions of customer records leak online, AT&T Resets Passcodes after Millions of Customer Records Leaked Online ,"Phone giant AT&T has recently reset millions of customer account passcodes after a massive data breach that revealed the sensitive information of millions of its customers. The leaked data contained encrypted passcodes that could be used to access AT&T customer accounts.

The U.S. telco giant initiated the passcode mass-reset after TechCrunch informed AT&T on Monday that the leaked data contained encrypted passcodes that could be used to access AT&T customer accounts. A security researcher who analyzed the leaked data told TechCrunch that the encrypted account passcodes are easy to decipher.

In a statement provided Saturday, AT&T said: “AT&T has launched a robust investigation supported by internal and external cybersecurity experts. Based on our preliminary analysis, the data set appears to be from 2019 or earlier, impacting approximately 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and approximately 65.4 million former account holders.”

The leaked data includes AT&T customer names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. The security researcher, Sam “Chick3nman” Croley, discovered that each record in the leaked data also contains the AT&T customer’s account passcode in an encrypted format.

To decrypt the passcodes, Croley took all of the encrypted passcodes from the 73 million data set and removed every duplicate. The result amounted to about 10,000 unique encrypted values, which correlate to each four-digit passcode permutation ranging from 0000 to 9999, with a few outliers for the small number of AT&T customers with account passcodes longer than four digits.

Croley was able to reverse-engineer which encrypted values matched which plaintext passcode by correlating encrypted account passcodes to surrounding account data such as customer dates of birth, house numbers, and partial Social Security numbers and phone numbers.

AT&T said it will contact all of the 7.6 million existing customers whose passcodes it reset, as well as current and former customers whose personal information was compromised. It is essential for AT&T customers to take action and secure their accounts immediately by changing their passcodes to something more secure and unique.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/att-store-nyc-times-square-breach.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 14:10:39,"""AT&T Hacked: Millions of Customer Passcodes Reset after Data Breach"" - Protect Your Account Now", security breach ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Are We on the Brink of a Bull Market?

Investors in the crypto venture landscape have been waiting for the right moment to strike, and that moment may have finally arrived. The first quarter of 2024 has seen a surge in investments, with $2.52 billion in total capital raised across the crypto and blockchain sectors. This represents a 25% increase over the $2.02 billion raised in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The crypto venture capital funding landscape has been cautiously optimistic, rebounding from a challenging two-year period of fundraising difficulties for both companies and managers. Despite a significant year-over-year decrease in both VC and crypto funding in 2023, around 65%, there is a noticeable uptick in deal-making activity.

But why now? There are several factors contributing to the market's recent surge. One significant development has been the positive legal wins last year from Ripple and Grayscale, as well as positive sentiments around decentralized finance (DeFi) on Solana. The demand for the biggest cryptocurrency post SEC spot bitcoin ETF approvals in the U.S. is also increasing.

Another factor that has affected the market is the thought that we wouldn't die. After the collapse of LUNA, BlockFi, FTX, the banking crisis, and the thought was that we would die and we didn't.

The crypto venture capital landscape has heated up in part because of these positive developments. Additionally, the market is seeing a surge in institutional interest, which is starting to convert into real budgets and products. For example, BlackRock is launching its tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain, which could lead to heightened competitive pressure from traditional financial institutions and more adoptions.

In terms of deal flow, the crypto startup landscape has picked up in areas ranging from DeFi to SocialFi to Bitcoin layer-2 growth. SocialFi, which refers mainly to decentralized social media, is currently very hot. Some success in this sector can be attributed to decentralized social app networks like Farcaster, which is using Web 2.0 techniques to adopt new audiences. Web3 gaming is also rapidly expanding, with hundreds of new games expected to go to market later this year.

Crypto and AI, blockchains and anything zero-knowledge related are ""red-hot right now,"" according to Tom Schmidt, a partner at Dragonfly Capital. Given the grandiose expectations for AI's potential to impact the global economy, it is expected that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.

Competitiveness among VCs is creating an environment in which founders have greater leverage in fundraising. There is ""no shortage of hungry money as of recently,"" said Michael Anderson, co-founder of Framework Ventures. Founders now have optionality and the ability to set terms, with competitive rounds filling out before investors have time for intensive due diligence.

In conclusion, the crypto venture landscape is experiencing a surge in investments, driven by a range of factors including legal wins, positive sentiment, and institutional interest. As the market continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how it unfolds and what the future holds for the world of crypto.

Hassabis, born in London in 1976, emerged as a prodigy in a number of disciplines and reached master status at chess by the time he was a teenager. He subsequently became lead programmer at fabled U.K. video game developer Bullfrog Productions; graduated from the University of Cambridge with first-class honors in Computer Science; and worked in various AI and computer science roles before gaining a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from University College London (UCL). Alongside Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, who Microsoft hired from AI startup Inflection AI last week, Hassabis founded DeepMind out of London in 2010.

Hassabis was awarded a CBE in 2017 for ""services to science and technology,"" but the company courted controversy after signing data-sharing deals with the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS).

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-optimization-based-method-autonomous.html,An optimization-based method to enhance autonomous parking,Optimized autonomous parking with OCEAN planner.,"

Self-driving vehicles have been a long-term goal for both the automotive industry and robotics research. While various companies have been investing in these vehicles and testing them, they have only been deployed in limited settings so far.

One of the most exciting areas of research in this field is ""automated valet parking"" (AVP), a feature that allows a car to drive itself from the parking entrance to a free spot. While AVP has garnered substantial research interest, its reliable realization has so far proven challenging.

Recently, researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai have developed OCEAN, an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner for the autonomous parking of vehicles. OCEAN is an optimization-based trajectory planner that uses the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) to enhance computational efficiency and robustness, making it suitable for all scenes with few dynamic obstacles.

The OCEAN planner was designed to overcome the two primary shortcomings of approaches presented in previous studies on autonomous parking: the inability to accurately predict collisions and poor performance in real-time tests.

The OCEAN planner builds on the previously introduced approach called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA), addressing its primary limitations. Its improved design ultimately improves its ability to avoid collisions, along with its robustness and speed in real-time.

""Starting from a hierarchical optimization-based collision avoidance framework, the trajectory planning problem is first warm-started by a collision-free Hybrid A trajectory,"" the authors wrote in their paper.

""Then the collision avoidance trajectory planning problem is reformulated as a smooth and convex dual form and solved by ADMM in parallel. The optimization variables are carefully split into several groups so that ADMM sub-problems are formulated as Quadratic Programming (QP), Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problems that can be efficiently and robustly solved.""

The researchers tested their planner on hundreds of simulated scenarios and conducted real-world experiments in public parking areas. The results were highly promising, as OCEAN was found to outperform a variety of methods for autonomous parking applications.

""Results show that the proposed method has better system performance compared with other benchmarks,"" the authors explained. ""Our method makes it possible to deploy large-scale parking planner on low computing power platforms that require real-time performance.""

The planner developed by this team of researchers could be improved and tested in additional real-world trials. In the future, it could be deployed by automotive companies, contributing to the introduction of automated vehicle parking technologies.

This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Shanghai Municipal Natural Science and Technology Foundation. The researchers at Mach Drive have published their findings in a paper pre-published on arXiv.

Space and Time, a web3 startup, has identified this issue and is working to provide a solution through verifiable computing.

According to Scott Dykstra, the CTO and co-founder of Space and Time, the need for data transparency and verification is critical, particularly in the wake of the FTX collapse, where trust in the crypto exchange was shattered. “There’s an incentive for bad actors to want to manipulate things, and every time there’s a higher incentive, where people would want to manipulate data, records, books, finances, or more, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) can be used to verify and retrieve the data,” said Dykstra.

At its core, ZK proofs work by having two parties, a prover and a verifier, that confirm a statement is true without conveying any information more than whether it’s correct. For example, if someone wanted to know whether someone’s credit score was above 700, a ZK proof could confirm that to the verifier without actually disclosing the exact number.

Space and Time is working to become the verifiable computing layer for web3 by indexing data both off-chain and on-chain. The startup has already indexed data from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others, and is adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

Dykstra sees the potential for ZK proofs to be applied beyond the web3 industry, particularly in other areas where data manipulation is prevalent. For example, in a hypothetical scenario, OpenAI, the owner of a database of a journal, could be forced to create a decentralized, on-chain database that is readily available and uncensorable.

Overall, Space and Time’s verifiable computing layer has the potential to revolutionize the way data is managed and verified, particularly in the world of AI. As Dykstra put it, “We need a decentralized, but globally, always available database that can be created through blockchains, everyone needs to access it, it can’t be a monopoly.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1828490321.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 17:00:55,"Space and Time is working to provide a solution to the need for data transparency and verification through verifiable computing.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-elastic-strain.html,A first-ever complete map for elastic strain engineering, Understand Elastic Strain Engineering with MIT's Map for Crystalline Materials ,"The ""map,"" or the phonon stability boundary, is a visual representation of the stability regions of a crystal as a function of strain. This map helps scientists and engineers determine the conditions under which a material can exist in a particular phase and when it might fail or transition to another phase. By analyzing the phonon stability boundary, researchers can understand material properties at extreme conditions and design new materials with desired characteristics. Without a map, it can be challenging to know not just where you are, but where you're going, especially when it comes to materials properties.

For decades, scientists have known that bulk materials behave in certain ways, but those rules can break down for materials at the micro- and nano-scales, and often in surprising ways. One of those surprises was the discovery that, for some materials, applying even modest strains on materials can dramatically improve certain properties, provided those strains stay elastic and do not relax away by plasticity, fracture, or phase transformations. Micro and nano-scale materials are especially good at holding applied strains in the elastic form.

Recently, a team of MIT researchers has developed the first-ever map of how to tune crystalline materials to produce specific thermal and electronic properties using a combination of first principles calculations and machine learning. Led by Ju Li, the Battelle Energy Alliance Professor in Nuclear Engineering and professor of materials science and engineering, the team described a framework for understanding precisely how changing the elastic strains on a material can fine-tune properties like thermal and electrical conductivity. The work is described in an open-access paper published in PNAS.

""For the first time, by using machine learning, we've been able to delineate the complete six-dimensional boundary of ideal strength, which is the upper limit to elastic strain engineering, and create a map for these electronic and phononic properties,"" Li says. ""We can now use this approach to explore many other materials. Traditionally, people create new materials by changing the chemistry.""

For example, with a ternary alloy, you can change the percentage of two elements, so you have two degrees of freedom. What the team showed is that diamond, with just one element, is equivalent to a six-component alloy, because you have six degrees of elastic strain freedom you can tune independently.

Small strains, big material benefits

The paper builds on a foundation",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-first-ever-complete.jpg,2024-03-29 14:41:04,"of previous work on the use of elastic strains to improve material properties, which has revealed surprising benefits at the micro- and nano-scales. Elastic strains used to fine-tune properties like thermal and electrical conductivity are small, typically on the order of a few percent, but they can have a big impact on a material's properties. For example, applying a modest strain to a diamond film, which is a popular material for high-speed electronics, can increase its electrical conductivity by a factor of 10,000.

The team's approach to elastic strain engineering is based on first principles calculations, which provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of materials under different conditions. The calculations involve solving complex equations that describe the interactions between atoms and molecules in a material. The machine learning algorithms then use this data to create a map of the stability regions of the crystal as a function of strain.

""Machine learning is a powerful tool for analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns or relationships that might be difficult to discern otherwise,"" Li says. ""In this case, we're able to use machine learning to create a map that can be used to predict the properties of a material under different conditions.""

The researchers' work has important implications for materials science and engineering, as well as for a wide range of industries that rely on advanced materials. For example, the ability to tune the properties of materials to specific applications could enable the development of new materials for energy storage, electronics, and aerospace.

""The beauty of this approach is that it's flexible and can be used to explore many different materials and properties,"" Li says. ""We're just scratching the surface, but I'm excited about the potential for this work to have a significant impact on the field of materials science and engineering.""

This week, TC’s auto reporter Sean O’Kane revealed how EV startup Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete.
Elsewhere, Lorenzo reported how Facebook snooped on users’ Snapchat traffic in a secret project known internally at Meta as “Project Ghostbusters.” According to court documents, the goal was to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat’s app and its servers.
And Manish wrote about the resignation of Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque late last week. Mostaque’s departure from Stability AI — the startup known for its popular image generation tool Stable Diffusion — comes amid an ongoing struggle for stability (pun intended) at the company, which was reportedly spending ~$8 million a month as of October 2023 with little revenue to show for it.
Lots else happened. We recap it all in this edition of WiR, providing a coherent and engaging overview of the week’s tech news.
News
Fisker suspended: Fisker’s bad week continued with a halt in the startup’s stock trading. The New York Stock Exchange moved to take Fisker off the exchange, citing its “abnormally low” stock levels.
AI-powered itineraries: In an upgrade to its Search Generative Experience, Google has added the ability for users to ask Google Search to plan a travel itinerary. Using AI, Search will draw on ideas from websites around the web along with reviews, photos and other details.
Robinhood’s new card: Nine months after acquiring credit card startup X1 for $95 million, Robinhood on Wednesday announced the launch of its new Gold Card, powered by X1’s technology, with a list of features that could make Apple Card users envious.
At AT&T, mum’s the word: The personal information of some 73 million AT&T customers spilled online this week. But AT&T won’t say how — despite the hack responsible having happened over three years ago.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/orbit-fab-unveils-30k-port-to-refuel-satellites/,Orbit Fab unveils $30K port to refuel satellites, In-Space Refueling: Orbit Fab Launches $30K Port for Satellites ,"Orbit Fab is revolutionizing the way satellites are refueled in space with its innovative technology. The Colorado-based startup has recently launched its Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface (RAFTI) docking mechanism, which is now flight-qualified and on the market. The RAFTI allows customer spacecraft to receive propellant from an orbital tanker, and the price for each port is just $30,000.

Orbit Fab's CEO and co-founder Daniel Faber has been in the space industry for decades and is best known for his work with Deep Space Industries (DSI), a company that was targeting asteroid mining. The company was eventually acquired by Bradford Space. During an interview, Faber joked that he had ""something that's too early"" and that he believed the next big opportunity was in-space refueling.

Part of the reason for this shift is the simplicity of the architecture. Orbit Fab's technology is straightforward: the company equips customer satellites with a refueling port while the hardware is still on Earth. Once a RAFTI-equipped satellite runs out of propellant, an Orbit Fab tanker can pick up fuel from orbital depots and deliver it directly to the customer's satellite for refueling.

However, this simplicity does not mean that the hardware is easy to develop. There are many variables to consider, including the cost to the customer versus the potential marginal revenue from extra life on orbit, the impact of fueling on the customer spacecraft, and the challenge of developing a docking mechanism that can also transfer propellant.

In addition to these challenges, Orbit Fab had to ensure that its component met stringent standards from NASA, the Space Force, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to ensure safety, reliability, and ability to withstand the harsh environment of space.

One of the significant shifts in the space industry since Orbit Fab's inception has been the standing up of the U.S. Space Force. The company has pivoted much of its attention to addressing the nascent needs of the Space Force, which was very interested in orbital mobility to avoid space debris or rendezvous with other satellites.

Looking ahead, Orbit Fab anticipates the first RAFTIs going to orbit on customers","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An-Orbit-Fab-fuel-shuttle-is-docking-with-an-on-orbit-satellite-equipped-with-a-RAFTI-refueling-port.jpg?resize=1200,817",2024-03-29 18:34:11,"Revolutionize space refueling with innovative technology - Orbit Fab's RAFTI docking mechanism is now flight-qualified and on the market, offering affordable propellant refueling for customer spacecraft.

Orbit Fab's CEO and co-founder, Daniel Faber, believes the future of space exploration lies in in-space refueling, and the company has already shifted its focus to address the needs of the U.S. Space Force, with plans for the first RAFTIs to go to orbit on customer spacecraft.
