Mahbod Moghadam, an entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of Genius and Everipedia, passed away last month due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. He was 41 years old. The news of his demise was announced on Genius's website in a post attributed to his family.

The startup world recently learned about Moghadam's passing, with numerous tributes pouring in on social media platforms, including from former TechCrunch writer-turned-investor Josh Constine, who once interviewed Moghadam and his co-founders at Genius, then known as Rap Genius.

Moghadam had been living in Los Angeles, focusing on finding ways to help creators earn more directly from their work. He recently worked on HellaDoge, a short-lived social media platform that aimed to pay its users in dogecoin for contributing dogecoin-related content.

Moghadam's interest in creators' compensation can be traced back to 2009 when, after graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, he became a lawyer just as the economy was collapsing. Following his dismissal from the law firm, he used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman.

Rap Genius, later rebranded as Genius, started as a platform for users to annotate and explain hip-hop lyrics. Its success attracted rappers like Nas, who became an advisor and an early investor. The company eventually expanded its remit and graced the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2013.

However, Moghadam's tenure at Genius was marked by controversial behavior, leading to his resignation in 2014. Following his departure, he co-founded Everipedia, a decentralized, blockchain-based encyclopedia, and later joined Mucker Capital as an entrepreneur in residence.

Despite his professional ups and downs, Moghadam remained a beloved figure among Genius's most dedicated fans, appearing on various podcasts where he shared",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8698091273_475f659390_b.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-07 01:51:05,"""Co-founder of Genius & Everipedia, Mahbod Moghadam, passes at 41.

Introduction

In the face of escalating energy demand and the urgent need for sustainable solutions, small modular reactors (SMRs) have emerged as a viable contender in the carbon-free power source landscape. Despite setbacks, such as the cancellation of NuScale's project in Idaho, the nuclear industry remains optimistic about the potential of SMRs. This article explores the current state of SMRs, their benefits, and the challenges they face, as well as highlighting some of the key players in the field.

The State of Small Modular Reactors

Numerous nations have considered phasing out nuclear plants, but SMR manufacturers are confident they can win over skeptical customers. The recent cancellation of a next-generation US nuclear plant has not deterred supporters of nuclear power, who remain hopeful that new projects will come online by the end of the decade. For instance, GE Hitachi's new SMR design, the BWRX-300, is expected to start producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, by 2029, pending regulatory approval.

Challenges and Opportunities

One of the main challenges facing SMRs is managing costs. The collapse of NuScale's project in Idaho, which saw costs surge from $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion, has raised concerns about the financial viability of SMRs. However, industry experts argue that this was an isolated incident and that the potential for upside risk was the primary issue, rather than the initial estimated costs. They emphasize the need for improved risk sharing across the first new models to ensure repeatability and lower costs.

Another factor contributing to rising costs is the increased price of commodities like steel, as well as higher uranium prices. Companies like TerraPower, which plans to begin construction on a nuclear reactor in Wyoming in June, are focusing on innovations such as molten chloride technology to increase efficiency and lower costs.

Standardization across multiple projects is another crucial step in reducing costs. Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation's Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) project, slated for completion in Gadsden, Alabama, in 2027, is an example of a standardized design that could help",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/several-nations-have-m.jpg,2024-04-07 13:36:00,"Meta Description under 18 word: Co-founder of Genius Mahbod Moghadam's Legacy & Contributions to the Startup World

The prevalence of autism in the United States is alarming, with one in 36 children affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Early diagnosis is crucial for improved developmental outcomes, and EarliTec Diagnostics is at the forefront of this battle. The Atlanta-based startup has recently secured funding to expand its groundbreaking system that enables clinicians to diagnose children as young as 16 months old.

Revolutionizing Autism Diagnosis

EarliTec Diagnostics' innovative approach involves having children watch short videos and social interactions on a screen for 12 minutes while an AI-powered device tracks their eye movements. The startup's FDA-authorized technology capitalizes on the fact that children with autism focus on videos differently than their neurotypical counterparts.

Raising the Stakes in Autism Diagnosis

EarliTec Diagnostics recently raised a $21.5 million Series B round led by Nexus NeuroTech Ventures and Venture Investors. With only eight clinicians currently using the technology across six states, the startup aims to expand its commercialization and reach more children in need. The company also plans to allocate some of the funds towards research aimed at expanding the age group it can diagnose and improving assessment and treatment options.

The Challenges and Rewards of Fundraising

EarliTec's CEO, Tom Ressemann, has previously led other medical device startups, including Amphora Medical and Entellus Medical. He described this fundraising round as the most challenging yet rewarding. Despite the high prevalence of autism, it has historically been difficult to secure funding in this space, with only certain investors showing interest. However, recent momentum and growing interest from venture capitalists in autism-focused healthcare signal a positive change.

A Wave of Investments in Autism-Focused Healthcare

In addition to EarliTec's successful fundraising round, several other startups in the autism-focused healthcare space have recently raised significant capital. Cortica, a company providing diagnoses and treatment plans, has raised more than $175 million from notable investors.

In the secretive world of vulnerabilities, the price of zero-day exploits has hit record highs. As devices and applications become more secure, the value of these elusive weaknesses has surged, reaching up to $7 million for iOS exploits and $5 million for Android exploits. This modern-day gold rush signals the increased difficulty in hacking products from tech titans such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Once, a single researcher could discover and develop a zero-day exploit for iPhones or Androids. Now, as cybersecurity analyst David Manouchehri explains, ""this is almost impossible."" The escalating landscape demands a team of several researchers to uncover and exploit these vulnerabilities, resulting in exorbitant prices.

Crowdfense, a startup offering some of the highest-known prices for zero-day exploits, currently provides up to $7 million for iOS exploits, $5 million for Android exploits, $3.5 million for Safari exploits, and $5 million for WhatsApp and iMessage exploits. These figures are more than double the previous price list, published in 2019. The surge in prices mirrors the growing challenge faced by attackers as companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft enhance their devices' and apps' security, protecting users.

Shane Huntley, the head of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, notes, ""As more zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered by threat intelligence teams like Google’s, and platform protections continue to improve, the time and effort required from attackers increase, resulting in an increase in cost for their findings.""

The growing complexity of exploitation has led to an increase in the number of zero-day vulnerabilities utilized in the wild. Google reported that hackers employed 97 zero-day exploits in 2023, with 75% targeting Google products and Android, primarily from spyware vendors working with zero-day brokers.

The market's growth has also seen new players entering the scene, such as Operation Zero, an organization that aims to uncover and ethically disclose zero-day exploits to affected vendors. While their mission differs from traditional brokers, the rise in prices has affected their operations, too.

Mechanical keyboards have become increasingly popular in recent years, transitioning from a niche product to a mainstream staple in home offices. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become household names, offering a vast array of layouts and components for enthusiasts to choose from. However, as high-end features have become standard, the market has begun to stagnate, with many keyboards sharing similar features and designs. Enter magnetic switches, the potential catalyst for a new wave of innovation in the mechanical keyboard scene.

Magnetic switches offer a unique advantage over traditional mechanical switches: the ability to quickly change the actuation point, or the point during the keypress where the switch registers your downstroke. This feature allows users to customize their typing experience to suit their specific needs, providing greater flexibility than ever before.

Traditional mechanical keyboards rely on physical contact between two metal leaves to register a keypress. The stem, or the moving part that the keycap is attached to, pushes against these metal leaves, closing the circuit and registering the keypress. The shape and design of the stem, spring, and switch housing can significantly impact the feel and sound of the switch. For example, linear switches like Gateron Reds have smooth stems, while tactile switches like Cherry Browns have a bump that provides resistance during the keypress.

Magnetic switches, on the other hand, rely on magnets and sensors to register keypresses. These switches use a permanent magnet in the stem, and as the key is pressed, the sensor on the keyboard's PCB detects changes in the magnetic field, registering the keypress at a customizable actuation point. This feature allows users to adjust the actuation point to their liking, providing a level of customization that traditional mechanical switches cannot match.

Magnetic switches also offer other advantages over traditional mechanical switches. For example, because the actuation point can be changed, users can register keypresses earlier in the keypress, reducing the amount of force required to register a keypress. This feature is particularly useful for gamers, who can register keypresses more quickly and accurately. Additionally, magnetic switches can detect the release point of a keypress, allowing for even greater customization options.

The High Cost of Electric Vehicles: A Reality Check

As automakers report their Q1 sales, it’s clear that EV pricing is a significant concern. A recent Edmunds survey reveals a discrepancy between consumer preferences and available options. A majority of buyers seek EVs under $40,000, while only four models meet this price. The average EV price in 2023 is $61,702, nearly $15,000 higher than other vehicles.

The pricing issue has resulted in downward pressure on EV prices, forcing automakers like Ford to delay future launches. Even Tesla, a leader in the EV market, fell short of expectations, with deliveries down 20% from Q4 2023. To counteract this, Tesla is planning to slash prices further and capitalize on its Full Self-Driving software, currently offered as a free one-month trial to all customers.

Industry News and Developments

This week, we learned about the closure of Ghost Autonomy, which had raised over $220 million and recently partnered with OpenAI. The company, which pivoted several times since its inception in 2017, reportedly could not secure funding for its urban driving product.

On a brighter note, Maniv, an early-stage investment firm focusing on the intersection of mobility, transportation, and energy, announced a $140 million fund. The firm has expanded its investor base and geographic reach, shifting away from the term “mobility” in favor of “deep tech, decarbonization, and digitization.”
