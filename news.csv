https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork","Redis Fork Backed by AWS, Google, Oracle and More as Redis Labs Switch to SSPL)","The Linux Foundation has recently announced that it will host Valkey, a fork of the Redis in-memory data store. This news comes after Redis Labs, the company behind the open-source Redis project, switched to a more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL) from the permissive 3-clause BSD license on March 20. This change made it incompatible with the standard definition of “open source,” which requires commercial agreements to offer Redis-as-a-service.

Redis, a popular data store that is at the core of many large commercial and open-source deployments, has seen a few licensing disputes throughout its lifetime. In 2009, Salvatore Sanfilippo, the founder of Redis, launched the project under the BSD 3-clause license, which allowed for commercial forks. However, Redis quickly gained popularity, and Garantia, the first major Redis service provider, rebranded to RedisDB in 2013. Sanfilippo and the community pushed back, and Garantia eventually changed its name to Redis Labs in 2015. In 2021, Redis Labs became Redis, and Sanfilippo transferred his IP to Redis Labs/Redis before stepping down from the company in 2020.

In 2021, Redis changed how it licensed its Redis Modules, which include visualization tools, a client SDK, and more. The modules were initially licensed under the Apache License with the added Commons Clause, which restricted others from selling and hosting these modules. However, Redis emphasized that the license for open-source Redis remained BSD and would always remain BSD. That commitment lasted until a few weeks ago, when Redis Labs announced that it was switching to the SSPL.

Redis Labs’ CEO Rowan Trollope emphasized that the large cloud vendors, including AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, profited from the open-source version and were free to enter a commercial agreement with Redis. Valkey, the fork of Redis, originated at AWS and was supported by the other cloud vendors.

Olson, a longtime Redis maintainer who started the Valkey project in her own GitHub account, noted that she always knew that Redis had the right to switch to a new license. “I’m more just disappointed than anything else,” she said. “Redis had been a good steward in the past, and I think the community is kind of disappointed in the change.”

Redis Labs’ decision to switch to the SSPL has sparked a debate about the future of open-source software. While some argue that the SSPL restricts the ability of others to contribute to the project, others say that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the project.

In conclusion, Redis Labs’ decision to switch to the SSPL has created a fork of the project, Valkey, which is backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap. While the SSPL has sparked a debate about the future of open-source software, it is important to remember that Redis Labs has the right to make this change. The open-source community will continue to debate the merits and drawbacks of the SSPL, but one thing is clear: Redis remains a popular and important data store in the world of open-source software.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"Ready to improve your Redis knowledge?

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/iron-sheepdog-is-fixing-short-haul-trucking-from-the-bottom-up/,Iron Sheepdog is fixing short-haul trucking from the bottom up, Revolutionizing Short-Haul Trucking with Iron Sheepdog's Software: Streamlining Adoption and Driving Growth ,"The construction industry is often slow to adopt new technology, but Iron Sheepdog is looking to change that. As a software company that focuses on short-haul trucking, Iron Sheepdog aims to streamline and automate the process of managing short-term truckers, making it easier for companies to track their contracted trucks and ensuring that they can complete their jobs on time and within budget.

Iron Sheepdog's software is designed to be user-friendly for both companies and truckers. Companies can easily track their contracted trucks through the platform, while truckers can use an app to accept jobs and get paid online. This approach has been successful for Iron Sheepdog, which has seen its growth double each year since it was founded.

What sets Iron Sheepdog apart from its competitors is its focus on adoption. Rather than trying to force contractors to use their software, Iron Sheepdog started by engaging directly with short-haul truck drivers. They created a simple app that was easy for truckers to use and tied it to a 24-hour pay system. This approach worked, as truckers were more likely to sign up for the app if they knew they would be paid on time.

As more and more truckers signed up for the app, it became easier for brokers and contractors to adopt the platform as well. This allowed Iron Sheepdog to expand its network of short-haul truckers and create new opportunities for companies looking to hire trucks.

Iron Sheepdog's success has been driven by its ability to solve a real problem in the construction industry. Traditional methods of managing short-haul trucking were inefficient and often resulted in delays and cost overruns. By streamlining the process and providing real-time tracking and payment, Iron Sheepdog has made it easier for companies to complete their jobs on time and within budget.

Investors have taken notice of Iron Sheepdog's success, and the company recently raised $10 million in a Series B round. This funding will be used to continue scaling the platform and expanding Iron Sheepdog's network of short-haul truckers.

Overall, Iron Sheepdog's approach to short-haul trucking has shown that technology can be a powerful tool for improving efficiency and reducing costs in the construction industry. As the company continues to grow and innovate, it will likely remain a leader in this space for years to come.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ISD_broker-truck.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 16:00:39,"Optimize your short-haul trucking operations with Iron Sheepdog's user-friendly software.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-fabricating-high-density-vertical.html,A new strategy for fabricating high-density vertical organic electrochemical transistor arrays, High-Density OECTs: A New Strategy for Fabricating Mechanically Flexible Electronic Components ,"The world of electronics is constantly evolving, and one of the most promising emerging technologies is organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). These transistors are based on organic superconducting materials that can modulate electrical current in response to small changes in voltage, making them ideal for various applications, including biosensors, wearable devices, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their advantages, most conventional OECTs developed so far have been found to exhibit various limitations, such as limited stability and slow redox processes.

Researchers at Northwestern University have recently developed a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs. Their approach, outlined in a paper in Nature Electronics, allows for the creation of various electronic components based on OECT arrays and circuits. The researchers used a method known as electron beam lithography (eBL) to pattern organic semiconductor films, which resulted in ultra-small and high-density vertical OECT arrays and circuits.

Using eBL, the researchers were able to produce a pattern on the semiconducting films without employing masks or chemical solvents that could damage the materials. This made the films electronically inactive (i.e., insulating) without affecting their ability to conduct ions. The patterned films resulting from this process presented well-defined, conducting channel regions, while the eBL strategy employed by the researchers enabled the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits.

The resulting p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays exhibited transconductances of 0.08–1.7 S, transient times of less than 100 µs, and stable switching properties of more than 100,000 cycles. The researchers also successfully used their fabrication strategy to create various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These circuits performed remarkably well while also maintaining excellent operational stability.

This recent study could inform the development of similar approaches to boost the stability and performance of OECT circuits. Moreover, the new e-beam exposure strategy introduced by the researchers could facilitate the scalable fabrication of OECTs, contributing to their integration into electronic devices.

In conclusion, the development of high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs is a significant step",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/high-density-vertical.jpg,2024-03-31 09:00:01,"towards the creation of efficient and flexible electronic devices. With the advancements in fabrication techniques, researchers have successfully created p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays and vertically stacked logic circuits. The resulting devices exhibit stable switching properties and excellent operational stability, making them ideal for various applications. This study highlights the potential of OECTs in the future of electronics and could pave the way for their widespread adoption in wearable devices, biosensors, and other electronic systems.",Keyphrase: Organic Electrochemical Transistor Arrays,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Are you ready to experience the power of 6G vision services? With the advent of cutting-edge technologies like augmented reality (AR) and autonomous driving, it's now possible to capture videos and images quickly and efficiently. However, this requires high-performance processors (GPUs) and accurate learning models.

Professor Jeongho Kwak, from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST, has developed a learning model and resource optimization technology that combines accuracy and efficiency for 6G vision services. He has proposed a new integrated learning model and computing/networking optimization algorithm, VisionScaling, which can reduce energy consumption by at least 30% while maintaining average accuracy compared to current technologies without compromising on average target accuracy or time delay.

The VisionScaling algorithm developed by Professor Kwak's team adapts to constantly changing mobile environments to maintain optimal performance, even without prior knowledge of future conditions. It uses 'Online Convex Optimization (OCO),' one of the latest learning techniques.

Professor Kwak's team implemented and tested the real-world mobile vision service environment using embedded AI devices and connected edge computing platforms. They confirmed that the developed VisionScaling algorithm saves 30% more energy in mobile devices and improves end-to-end latency by 39% compared to previously used algorithms.

According to Professor Jeongho Kwak, ""This research satisfies both the practical contribution of implementing and verifying performance in irregularly changing mobile environments and the mathematical contribution of utilizing dynamic optimization and learning techniques to prove optimal performance. It is significant as it provides a technical foundation for deep learning-based mobile services requiring higher memory/computing resources in the future.""

This research is published in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-gmail-revolutionized-email-years-people.html,Gmail revolutionized email 20 years ago. People thought it was Google's April Fool's Day joke, Gmail: 20 Years of Revolutionizing Email ,"Title: Gmail's Groundbreaking Launch: The Evolution of Email Storage and Management

Google has long been known for its playful and innovative spirit, and what better way to showcase this than on April Fool's Day. In 2004, the tech giant unveiled Gmail, a free email service that boasted an astonishing 1 gigabyte of storage per account - a seemingly impossible amount at the time.

Before Gmail, webmail services such as Yahoo and Microsoft offered only 30 to 60 emails in total, which paled in comparison to the 13,500 emails that Gmail could store before running out of space. This translated into an astounding 250 to 500 times more email storage space.

But Gmail wasn't just about storage. It also came equipped with Google's advanced search technology, allowing users to quickly find specific information within their emails, photos, and other personal data stored on the service. Additionally, Gmail automatically threaded together conversations, making it easier for users to keep track of multiple conversations on the same topic.

Former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who helped design Gmail and other company products, said the original pitch focused on three key features: storage, search, and speed. The mind-bending concept of Gmail quickly gained traction, and it wasn't long before people started wondering if it was all too good to be true.

However, a reporter from The Associated Press was able to verify the authenticity of Gmail when an AP reporter was abruptly asked to visit Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. Upon arrival, the reporter was shown Gmail's sleek inbox and saw how quickly it operated within Microsoft's now-defunct Explorer web browser. Page also highlighted the lack of a delete button in the main control window, as users would rarely need to delete emails with so much storage space and easy search capabilities.

As it turns out, Gmail was a game-changer in the world of email storage and management. Today, it has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts, each offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. While this is still not enough for some users, it is a significant increase from the initial offerings and highlights the evolution of email storage and management.

In conclusion, Gmail's groundbreaking launch on April Fool's Day in 2004 marked a significant moment in the history of email storage and management. With its focus on storage, search, and speed, Gmail quickly became one of the most popular email services in the world, and its influence can still be seen today.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/gmail-revolutionized-e.jpg,2024-03-31 06:31:14,Gmail's Launch: How Google's Email Service Changed the Game and Revolutionized Email Storage and Management,Keyphrase: Gmail Storage,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
