Google has a free solution, Google's Guide to Watching the Solar Eclipse on April 7-8 for Free ,"In 2024, millions of people will have the chance to witness the moon completely covering the sun during the total solar eclipse. However, those who don't live in the path, can't travel to it, or prefer to watch from home can still do so thanks to Google.

On April 7-8, Google will be highlighting a content collection on Google TV that will make it easier for users to find the right channels to live stream the eclipse. All free, ad-supported local channels showing eclipse coverage will display custom-themed title cards that link to the live stream under the Total Solar Eclipse collection on Google TV.

Participating local and regional channels include NBC News Now, Scripps News, Reuters Now, AccuWeather NOW, and NBC affiliates in Dallas Fort Worth, Washington DC, San Diego, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York, Connecticut, South Florida, Boston, Bay Area, and Chicago.

If you don't have a smart TV or streaming device with Google TV built-in or the Google TV mobile app for Android or iOS, there will still be plenty of live streams available for free on YouTube, with some links already live, including the Associated Press's live stream.

Tuning in live from home is still a great opportunity to witness this rare and special occurrence. This marks the first time since 2017 that a total eclipse has been viewable in the US. The next total eclipse visible in the US will be in 2044.

Whether you're an eclipse enthusiast or just curious about this natural phenomenon, Google TV has got you covered. With its easy-to-use interface and custom-themed title cards, finding the right channels to live stream the eclipse has never been easier. So grab your smart TV or streaming device, and get ready to witness history in the making.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ba8168b125269945bdf186980d4fb15e9ca58214/2024/04/07/64e20174-42c1-4976-b56a-76c67236caf2/getty-chicago-tribune-eclipse.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-07 00:00:00,"""Discover the Total Solar Eclipse 2024 on Google TV!

Introduction

In the face of climate change and the need for cleaner energy sources, nuclear power has resurfaced as a viable option. Despite setbacks, such as the cancellation of a next-generation US nuclear plant and the increasing costs of small modular reactor (SMR) projects, the nuclear industry remains optimistic. This article explores the potential of SMRs, their current status, and the challenges they face in a rapidly changing energy landscape.

The State of Small Modular Reactors

Several nations have been phasing out nuclear plants, but SMR manufacturers are working to win over skeptical customers. Although NuScale, a US energy company, recently abandoned its SMR project in Idaho due to soaring costs, other projects are still moving forward. For instance, GE Hitachi's new SMR design, the BWRX-300, is expected to begin producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, by 2029. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned US power company, has also invested in this design.

Improving ""Risk Sharing"" and Standardization

John Kotek of the Nuclear Energy Institute emphasized the importance of improving ""risk sharing"" across initial SMR projects before the industry can build these reactors with more predictability and lower costs. Marcia Burkey, CFO at TerraPower, echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that higher prices for steel and other commodities, as well as increased uranium prices, have contributed to swelling costs. However, she is hopeful that innovation can help address these challenges.

TerraPower is focusing on a novel ""molten chloride"" technology, which can operate at higher temperatures than conventional reactors, enabling greater efficiency. The company plans to begin construction on a nuclear reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming, in June 2024, at a retired coal plant. TerraPower is also working on standardizing its projects to reduce costs.

Another project in development is Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation's Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR), which is expected to go online in Gadsden, Alabama, in 2027.
