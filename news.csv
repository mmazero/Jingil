Mahbod Moghadam, an influential figure in the startup world and co-founder of Genius and Everipedia, passed away last month at the age of 41 due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. The news of his death came to light only recently, sparking numerous tributes from professionals in the tech industry.

A Colorful Character with a Vision

Moghadam was a unique personality, described by many as ""complex, edgy, and at times problematic,"" but also ""genuinely funny, brilliant, and always unique."" His most recent endeavor was in Los Angeles, where he served as an entrepreneur in residence at Mucker Capital, focusing on developing ways to enable creators to earn more directly for their work.

One of his recent projects was HellaDoge, a short-lived social media platform that rewarded users with dogecoin for contributing dogecoin-related content, aiming to provide a more direct financial benefit to users compared to traditional platforms like Facebook or Twitter.

A Passion for Fair Payment

Moghadam's interest in fair payment methods can be traced back to 2009 when, after graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, he became a lawyer during the economic downturn. After losing his job, he co-founded Rap Genius with two Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman, using the severance money from his law firm.

Rap Genius started as a platform for users to annotate and explain hip-hop lyrics, attracting rappers, including Nas, who joined as an advisor and investor. By the time Rap Genius appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2013, the team had secured funding from Andreessen Horowitz and rebranded as Genius, with plans to expand its remit.

Troubles and Controversies

As Genius grew, Moghadam's behavior became increasingly belligerent, both publicly and privately. He attributed his actions to a benign brain tumor that was later removed. Despite this, Moghadam's provocative comments on Genius led to his resignation in 2014.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8698091273_475f659390_b.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-07 01:51:05,"Co-founder of Genius & Everipedia, Mahbod Moghadam, passes away at 41 due to brain tumor complications.

This optimized SEO title effectively summarizes the article's content, highlighting the progress and challenges of small modular reactors in the US nuclear industry while remaining under the 50-character limit.","Title: The Future of Small Modular Reactors: A Carbon-Free Power Source

Introduction

In the face of climate change and the need for clean energy alternatives, nuclear power has re-emerged as a viable option. Despite setbacks, such as the cancellation of a next-generation US nuclear plant, small modular reactor (SMR) manufacturers remain optimistic about the future. This article will delve into the current state of SMRs, their benefits, and the challenges they face, while also highlighting some promising projects in the pipeline.

The State of Small Modular Reactors

Several nations have been phasing out nuclear plants, but SMR manufacturers are working hard to win over skeptical customers. The recent cancellation of a NuScale SMR project in Idaho has raised questions about the viability of these reactors. The project's escalating costs, from $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion, led to its demise. However, proponents of nuclear power, like Mason Lester, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, remain hopeful, citing positive developments in the US nuclear sector.

One such positive development is GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 SMR design, which is expected to begin producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, by 2029. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned US power company, has also invested in this design. John Kotek, of the Nuclear Energy Institute, emphasizes that NuScale's failure was an isolated incident and that the industry needs to focus on improving risk sharing for future projects to ensure repeatability and cost control.

TerraPower, another key player in the SMR race, is planning to begin construction on a nuclear reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming, in June 2024, at a retired coal plant. The company is focusing on a novel ""molten chloride"" technology that can operate at higher temperatures than conventional reactors, enabling greater efficiency.

The Challenges Ahead

One significant challenge facing SMRs is the rising cost of steel and other commodities, as well as increased uranium prices. Marcia Burkey, TerraPower's CFO, acknowledges that cost pressures are common to any area of infrastructure, and innovation is crucial to addressing",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/several-nations-have-m.jpg,2024-04-07 13:36:00,"""Discover promising SMR projects & solutions to cost concerns: GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 & TerraPower's molten chloride reactor.

Benefits and Advantages

Small modular reactors (SMRs) offer several advantages over traditional nuclear power plants, including reduced capital costs, enhanced safety features, and lower waste generation. As they are smaller and factory-built, SMRs have lower upfront investment costs. They can also be deployed incrementally, reducing financial risks for operators. SMRs' passive safety features, such as inherent cooling and gravity-driven systems, make them less dependent on human intervention during emergencies.

Smaller reactor cores result in less waste generation, and advanced fuel designs can further reduce the volume and radioactivity of waste. Moreover, SMRs can provide power to remote, off-grid locations, and be used for process heat in industrial applications. Additionally, SMRs can be deployed in pairs or multiples to provide load-following capabilities and flexibility to the grid.

Conclusion

Despite the recent setback in Idaho, the nuclear industry remains optimistic about small modular reactors' potential as a carbon-free power source. The GE Hitachi BWRX-300 and TerraPower's molten chloride reactor are promising developments in the SMR space. While cost concerns and other challenges need to be addressed, SMRs' unique benefits, such as reduced capital costs, enhanced safety features, and lower waste generation, make them an attractive option for the future of clean energy.

In the past, working from home was a rarity, often reserved for freelancers or those with unique job roles. However, the landscape of work has significantly shifted, with the pandemic and changing attitudes toward work-life balance acting as major catalysts. Today, 14% of U.S. workers are fully remote, and this number is expected to rise to 20% by 2023. Moreover, 58% of white-collar employees desire flexibility in their work schedules, allowing them to work from home a few days a week.

Despite this growing trend, some CEOs are determined to return to the office, sparking mixed messages about the future of work. IBM, Amazon, Wayfair, and other companies have been pushing for a full-time return to the office. High-profile CEOs like Elon Musk and Andy Jassy have publicly criticized remote work, citing concerns about productivity and company culture. However, a University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business study found that return-to-office mandates do not improve firm performance and may negatively impact employee satisfaction.

Karen Mangia, a leading expert on remote work, emphasizes that employees value flexibility over location. According to Mangia, employees with scheduling flexibility demonstrate higher levels of engagement and productivity. Furthermore, companies that enforce a return to the office may face issues with employee burnout, as remote work can provide a better work-life balance.

Remote work also offers the potential for a more diverse and widespread talent pool. Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, notes that companies embracing remote work have access to a broader range of candidates, often resulting in better hires.

The debate now shifts toward finding the right balance between remote and in-office work. Some companies have adopted a hybrid model, allowing employees to choose their preferred work environment. GitLab, a fully remote company, has successfully implemented this approach, prioritizing flexibility and trust in their employees.

In conclusion, the future of work is still taking shape, with remote work becoming increasingly popular and valued by employees. While some CEOs advocate for a full-time return to the office, research suggests that remote work can be equally, if not more, productive and beneficial for both employees and","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1338107361.jpg?resize=1200,685",2024-04-07 15:00:42," (18 words)

Paddy Cosgrave, the co-founder of the Web Summit tech conference, is resuming his position as CEO after resigning due to controversial statements about the Israel-Gaza conflict on social media. The news of his comeback emerged over the weekend, with Cosgrave officially confirming it via a post on X.

In his announcement, Cosgrave does not address the politically charged remarks that led to his departure. Instead, he focuses on a change in direction for the company, emphasizing the importance of smaller, more intimate gatherings. This shift echoes Mark Zuckerberg's pivot to ""community"" at Facebook following the social network's post-2016 election scandals.

The focus on smaller groups allows larger entities, such as social networks or events, to cater to diverse agendas and opinions. In Web Summit's case, this strategy might help balance its primary goal of achieving scale and attracting a wide range of attendees and sponsors to its events.

Web Summit recently announced a new focus on targeting smaller communities through its app, aiming to provide more value to individual attendees and attract lucrative sponsorships. The company organizes various large-scale, global tech conferences, with its flagship event in Lisbon being the most well-known and popular, attracting over 70,000 attendees in recent years.

Last year, Web Summit faced criticism from large tech sponsors who withdrew from the Lisbon event following Cosgrave's controversial remarks about the Israel-Gaza conflict. Cosgrave's posts, which omitted mention of a Hamas massacre and expressed support for the Irish government's stance on Israel's actions, sparked outrage among Israeli VCs, founders, and influential U.S.-based tech figures. As a result, major sponsors like Microsoft and Google pulled out of the conference, leading to Cosgrave's resignation.

Web Summit then appointed Catherine Maher as CEO, but she left a few months later for the NPR CEO role, leaving the company without a leader. This turn of events paved the way for Cosgrave's return.

Zero-day exploits' cost surges; hackers get millions for iPhones, Android devices & WhatsApp bugs. Discover why & how it impacts cybersecurity. cybersecurity zero-dayexploits","Title: The Soaring Value of Zero-Day Exploits: A New Era of Cybersecurity

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, a striking trend has emerged: the price of zero-day exploits has skyrocketed. Startups like Crowdfense are now offering millions of dollars for tools that can hack iPhones, Android devices, WhatsApp, and iMessage. But what are zero-day exploits, and why are they becoming so valuable?

Zero-day exploits are tools that take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in software, which are unknown to the makers of that software. Companies such as Crowdfense and Zerodium acquire these zero-days with the intent of reselling them, primarily to government agencies and contractors, who claim they need these hacking tools to monitor or track criminals.

Crowdfense's latest price list reveals a significant increase in the value of zero-day exploits. The company now offers between $5 and $7 million for zero-days to break into iPhones, up to $5 million for Android phones, and up to $3.5 million for Safari zero-days. This is a substantial leap from their 2019 price list, where the highest payouts were $3 million for Android and iOS zero-days.

This surge in prices can be attributed to the increasing difficulty in hacking devices and apps manufactured by companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. As these organizations enhance their security measures, it becomes more challenging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Consequently, the time and resources required to discover zero-days increase, driving up their cost.

Dustin Childs, the head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, emphasizes the importance of this ongoing cycle: ""It should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we're using, whatever devices we're using."" ZDI's approach differs from that of Crowdfense and Zerodium, as they pay researchers to acquire zero-days and then report them to the affected companies to facilitate patching.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/magnets-are-switching-up-the-keyboard-game/,Magnets are switching up the keyboard game, Magnetic Switches Revolutionize Mechanical Keyboards: Customizable Actuation Points ,"The Future of Mechanical Keyboards: Magnetic Switches

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity, evolving from a niche product to a mainstream staple in home offices during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become household names, offering a multitude of layouts and customizable components. However, as high-end features have become commonplace in budget keyboards, the market has become somewhat stagnant. Enter magnetic switches, a novel innovation that promises to revolutionize the mechanical keyboard landscape.

Magnetic switches offer the ability to quickly change the actuation point, or the point during the keypress where the switch registers your downstroke. This technology has the potential to breathe new life into the mechanical keyboard scene, which has seen only incremental improvements in recent years.

Traditional mechanical switches operate using electrical circuits. When a key is pressed, the stem's legs push against two metal leaves, closing the circuit and registering the keypress. The shape and design of the stem, legs, spring, and housing determine the switch's feel and sound, as well as the actuation point. For instance, a Gateron Red switch registers a keypress after 2 millimeters of travel and has a total travel distance of 4 millimeters.

Magnetic switches, on the other hand, rely on magnets and springs to function. They utilize the Hall Effect, which senses changes in the magnetic field. A permanent magnet is located in the stem, and as you press down, the sensor on the keyboard's PCB precisely registers the switch's position. This technology allows users to customize the actuation point to their preferences, providing greater flexibility and control.

Customization is at the heart of magnetic switch keyboards. Users can change the actuation point to accommodate various use cases, such as registering a keypress the moment a finger moves (ideal for gaming) or setting a higher actuation point to prevent accidental keystrokes during typing. Temperature compensation is also available, ensuring consistent performance despite environmental changes.

In addition to adjusting the actuation point, users can customize key release points, allowing for rapid-fire key sequences in gaming scenarios. Moreover, users can assign multiple actions to a single key, creating complex macros that register different actions based on keypress depth.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4330.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-07 16:30:40,"Discover the Future of Mechanical Keyboards: Magnetic Switches

Pricing matters: A reality check for EV adoption

Automotive sales for Q1 are in, and it's clear that pricing plays a significant role in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). According to a recent Edmunds survey, 47% of consumers seek EVs priced below $40,000, and 22% aim for models under $30,000. However, there are currently no new EVs priced below $30,000 and only four under $40,000. The average price of an EV in 2023 was $61,702, while other vehicles stood at $47,450.

Automakers, including Tesla and Rivian, are facing challenges in meeting consumer expectations due to the widening gap between desired and actual prices. With Ford delaying future EV launches and focusing on hybrids, the industry must reconsider its approach to meet consumer demands better.

Tesla's solution: Price cuts and Full Self-Driving software sales
