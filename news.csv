In our increasingly connected world, access to reliable and fast Wi-Fi has become a necessity. As the number of wireless devices continues to grow, so does the strain on Wi-Fi networks. This has led researchers to explore new methods for optimizing Wi-Fi performance, particularly in congested environments where multiple users are connected to the same access point (AP).

Traditional Wi-Fi networks, based on IEEE802.11 WLAN standards, can suffer from performance issues when slow users join the network. Their slow transmission rates can affect the throughput rate of other users, while users can also interfere with each other when attempting to communicate with the AP. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various strategies to minimize the effects of these problems and improve overall system throughput.

One promising approach is to leverage user cooperation, where users are prompted by the AP to change their position to improve network performance. However, many existing techniques fail to consider the interference between users and the individual transmission rates of each user. Moreover, these techniques often neglect the possibility that some users may be fixed, while others can move.

To overcome these limitations, a team of researchers, including Associate Professor Sumiko Miyata from Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT), developed a novel AP connection method using game theory. Published in the IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society, their paper proposes a potential game model that determines the user position that maximizes system throughput.

Game theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of decisions and decision-making within clearly defined frameworks. In this approach, the user position that maximizes system throughput is determined using a potential game, which condenses the incentives for all users into a single function. This model takes into account the impact of the position of new users joining a WLAN on existing users and inter-user interference by calculating the probabilities of packet collisions.

The researchers tested their proposed AP connection strategy, which was directly based on their potential game model, by comparing it with previous AP connection methods. They analyzed the resulting AP throughput for each method in various scenarios involving different user positions. The results showed that their proposed strategy almost always resulted in a throughput improvement compared to other techniques, with the improvement in system performance reaching up to 6% in some cases.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making significant strides in content creation, particularly in areas like filmmaking and robotics. While AI can already generate realistic images based on textual descriptions, creating moving human figures in response to human instructions has remained a challenge. A promising new framework, however, is tackling this issue head-on.

In a paper presented at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024, a team of researchers from Beijing Institute of Technology, BIGAI, and Peking University introduce a novel approach for language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. Building on their previous work, HUMANIZE, the researchers employ scene affordance as an intermediate representation to improve the model's ability to generalize to new problems.

Language-guided human motion generation poses unique challenges. A successful model must effectively decompose the task into scene grounding and conditional motion generation. Early experiments with HUMANIZE showed that a two-stage framework could enhance motion generation capabilities. The new model, called Move as You Say, Interact as You Can (MYSIAC), unfolds in two stages:

1. Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for affordance map prediction
2. Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM) for generating human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance

The MYSIAC model first predicts the scene affordance map from the language description using the ADM and then generates interactive human motions with the AMDM, conditioned on the pre-produced affordance map. This approach offers several advantages over previous methods.

First, the representations used by MYSIAC clearly define the region associated with the user's descriptions or prompts, enhancing its 3D grounding capabilities. This allows the model to create convincing motions even with limited training data. Additionally, the affordance maps provide a deep understanding of the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, which helps the model generalize across diverse scene geometries.

The researchers' key contribution lies in leveraging explicit scene affordance representation to facilitate language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes.
