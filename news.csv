The Importance of Natural Light: How Near-Infrared Technology Can Help Combat Seasonal Affective Disorder

As we continue to spend more time indoors, we're losing touch with the natural benefits of sunlight. This has led to an increased awareness of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a condition that affects around 5% of the population, or 10 million Americans. SAD is caused by the lack of sunlight during the winter months, which affects the production of serotonin in the brain, leading to feelings of depression, fatigue, and other negative symptoms.

Light therapy lamps have become a popular solution for those who suffer from SAD. These lamps mimic the sun's natural light, providing a much-needed boost to those who spend most of their time indoors. However, recent research has shown that near-infrared (NIR) technology may be a more effective alternative to traditional light therapy.

NIR technology uses a segment of the light spectrum that sits between infrared and visible light, at around 600 and 1000 nanometers. According to the National Institute of Health, low-level light therapy in the far-red (FR) to near-infrared (NIR) range has gained worldwide attention for its therapeutic applications in a variety of medical conditions.

At this year's Mobile World Congress, a Dutch company called Seaborough showcased two innovative devices that utilize NIR technology. The first device sits next to a computer, while the second clips onto a display, looking similar to an external webcam. Both devices plug into a USB port for power and are designed to replace traditional light therapy lamps.

While the technology is still in its proof-of-concept phase, Seaborough is currently seeking partnerships to license the technology. The company hopes to integrate the technology into laptops themselves, although third-party accessories seem more likely.

As someone who has struggled with depression, I'm intrigued by the potential benefits of NIR technology. While the research is still out on the topic, a paper published a decade ago showed that PBM treatment at 6","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-25-at-8.18.54 PM.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-02-25 19:22:59

Why Your Smartphone's Back Should Be More Than Just a Blank Slate

As I gaze upon the back of my smartphone, I can't help but feel a sense of wasted potential. Sure, the cameras are a vital part of the device, but what about the rest of the real estate? It's like having a spacious backyard that's only being used for a single flower pot. It's time to utilize that space and make it work for us.

The idea of a secondary e-ink screen isn't novel. Yota Phone pioneered the concept years ago, but unfortunately, the company didn't quite make it. Foldable devices took center stage, and the innovation became a mere footnote. However, Infinix has taken the idea and tweaked it with their E-Color Shift technology. It's not a full-fledged low-power secondary display, but it's a step in the right direction.

The technology is fascinating. By applying different voltages, the electric field within the microstructure changes, causing the color particles to move and display the desired colors. It's like a mini magic show on the back of your phone. The best part? It doesn't consume much power, and the image remains static even when the battery isn't working hard.

I had the chance to play with a prototype at MWC in Barcelona, and while it's still in its early stages, it's an exciting prospect. The prototype required an external battery pack, but the end result could be a game-changer. Imagine being able to change your phone's ""skin"" at will, without worrying about battery life. It's like having a personal stylist for your device.

It's unclear whether this technology will be licensed by other companies or if it'll appear in future Infinix devices. However, it's a unique selling point that could set Infinix apart from its competitors. Sure, it may not be a must-have feature, but it's a fun addition that could make your phone stand out.

In recent years, the European startup market has gained significant attention from North American venture capital firms. However, setting up a successful strategy in the region has proved challenging for many. Despite the growth potential, several big-name firms have formally pulled out of the region, and those that remain are less active. The challenges facing North American VCs in Europe are numerous, and understanding them is essential for success.

One of the primary challenges is the diverse nature of the European market. Each country has its own language, currency, and cultural nuances, making it difficult for North American investors to navigate. Investing in Romania or Italy is not the same as investing in Texas or California. Additionally, startups and universities in Europe have different networks than those in the US, further complicating the investment landscape.

The European VC market has grown significantly over the last decade, with deal volume more than doubling, according to PitchBook data. This growth has led to increased competition for the best deals, especially at the early stages. As a result, North American VCs struggle to find a secure footing in the market. Local VCs have become more prominent, and startups are now looking to them for funding, rather than defaulting to North American investors.

Another reason for the struggle is the focus on London. Many North American VCs set up shop in London, which is no longer part of the European Union and is only one of the region's startup hubs. Having a presence in London does not provide visibility into other European markets. This focus drives up competition for deals in London, making it harder for North American GPs to get a stake. It also means they might be ignoring opportunities elsewhere.

Despite these challenges, some North American firms are still trying to plant roots in the region. General Catalyst merged with a seed-stage firm in Europe, La Famiglia, to better invest in early-stage opportunities in mainland Europe. Andreessen Horowitz and IVP have also opened offices in London.

The reason for their persistence is regulation. Hot startups in Europe are subject to less scrutiny than their US counterparts, making it easier for investors to take risks. Additionally, European startups are more likely","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-84545203.jpg?resize=1200,803",2024-02-25 15:00:14

As the full Moon sets and the Sun rises, we are reminded of the vastness and beauty of the universe. The Very Large Telescope (VLT) has closed its eyes after a long night of observations, but the image it captured of the Moon remains, a testament to the extraordinary quality of astronomy. The Moon, though 30,000 times farther away, appears to rest on the VLT platform, a reminder of the proximity of the celestial world to our own.

For many, the fascination with astronomy begins with the remarkable efforts of NASA to land Americans on the Moon. However, there is something more profound that connects us to the stars. Growing up in a small town with a clear view of the Moon, Venus, and the brightest stars, I was struck by the sheer wonder of the night sky. This year, I've had the opportunity to spend time in Chile and Argentina, visiting radio telescopes and enjoying the South American summer. The stable and predictable climate of our planet, which allows us to enjoy the beauty of the stars, is a fact that is essential to life as we know it.

People who live in areas with a marvelous view of the sky, such as the deserts of the American Southwest, Hawaii, South Africa, Australia, Chile, and Argentina, may be more interested in astronomy. Chile's northern Atacama Desert, in particular, is a haven for astronomy, with its clear skies and minimal light pollution. The country's location also offers a unique window onto the whole of our Milky Way Galaxy, which is not possible from the Northern hemisphere.

Estela Perez, a professor of biochemistry and chemistry at Andres Bello National University in Santiago, credits her childhood fascination with astronomy to the clear night skies over numerous large lakes in southern Chile. Even in Santiago, people can be found outside their homes or apartments, gazing at the stars and using phone apps to identify constellations. Despite the clear skies, professional astronomers in Chile still face challenges in securing telescope time on international telescopes that operate in the North.

Rainbow Six Siege is set to undergo a transformation in the coming year, with Ubisoft revealing a packed roadmap for Year 9. The game's developer has promised a wealth of exciting changes, including two new operators, two operator remasters, and PC and console cross-play.

First up is Year 9 Season 1, which introduced Deimos, an attacker with a unique ability to track his target's location. Deimos is the first playable villain in the game's history, and his addition is sure to shake up the gameplay dynamic. Alongside Deimos, Season 1 brings significant changes to shields, attachments, and ADS, making them more tank-focused and easier to manage.

Season 2 will see the first remaster of the year, with the Recruit getting an overhaul. While the Recruit has long been considered a basic and somewhat uninteresting operator, the upcoming changes aim to make it more appealing to players. The season will also introduce the full release of the Reputation System, map filters in the Standard Playlist, new maps, and new Target drills in the Map Training Playlist, as well as the full release of Siege Marketplace.

Season 3 will bring the second new operator of the year, hailing from Greece. Although details are still scarce, the operator's reveal is expected to generate a lot of excitement. The season will also feature the Siege Cup, a competitive tournament system in-game that offers unique rewards for top performers. Additionally, there will be improvements to the versus AI mode and the introduction of a badge system to showcase players' skills.

Finally, Season 4 will see a rework of an American operator and the expansion of cross-play between PC and console. This move is expected to create separate queues for controller and keyboard and mouse users, given the significant differences in playstyle.

Throughout the year, the dev team will focus on balancing changes to stop the run-and-gun play style that has come to dominate high-level play. The goal is to return Siege to its roots as a tactical shooter where equipment plays a crucial role.

The Mystery of DNA Repair: Unveiling the Role of PARP1

DNA damage is a constant threat to the integrity of our genetic material, and its accumulation has been linked to aging and various diseases. While we know that our cells have robust repair mechanisms to fix damaged DNA, the precise ways in which they do so have remained largely unknown. A recent study published in Cell has shed light on the process, revealing the crucial role of the enzyme PARP1 in repairing double-strand breaks.

PARP1: The Superglue of DNA Repair

When a strand of DNA snaps in half, PARP1 springs into action. This enzyme patrols the DNA, searching for signs of damage and alerting other repair proteins to join the effort. But how does it keep the broken strands from floating apart? Researchers at the Dresden University of Technology have discovered that PARP1 acts like superglue, connecting to the loose ends of the broken DNA strands and holding them together.

The researchers recreated double-strand DNA breaks in a test tube, allowing them to study the repair process in isolation. They found that PARP1 molecules gather at the site of injury and link up with each other, forming a sticky mass that keeps the DNA strands fixed together. This ""healing zone"" also acts as a barrier, preventing other cellular components from interfering with the repair process.

FUS: The Adhesive Remover

Another protein, FUS, plays a crucial role in the repair process. It helps to ""soften the glue"" created by PARP1, allowing other repair proteins to access the damaged DNA. Without FUS, the PARP1 molecules would continue to hold onto the DNA strands, preventing the repair process from proceeding.

Implications and Takeaways

The study provides valuable insights into the DNA repair process and the role of PARP1. Understanding how PARP1 works may lead to the development of drugs that mimic its activity and stimulate DNA repair. This could have significant implications for aging and age-related diseases, as DNA damage accumulates over time",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ce672e7c8e8bc0cfb0febb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-02-25 14:00:00

The Importance of PACE in Understanding Our Oceans and Combating Climate Change

As a former NASA scientist, I'm always thrilled to see successful missions that advance our understanding of our planet. The recent launch of the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite is no exception. PACE is a significant step forward in studying the complex interactions between our oceans and atmosphere, and its impact on climate change.

Our oceans are facing numerous challenges due to climate change, including marine heatwaves, sea level rise, coral bleaching, and loss of biodiversity. PACE will help researchers study the effects of climate change on phytoplankton, tiny marine plants that play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into their cellular material, making them a vital component in the Earth's carbon cycle.

So, how does PACE work? The satellite's primary instrument, the Ocean Color Instrument, uses different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to measure ocean color. This allows scientists to track the distribution of phytoplankton and identify which communities of these organisms are present on a daily, global scale. This information is not only valuable to researchers but also to coastal resource managers who need to identify bad algal blooms or diagnose the health of fisheries.

PACE also includes two polarimeter instruments, Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter 2 and Spectro-polarimeter for Planetary Exploration. These instruments will provide new information on cloud properties, aerosols, and air quality. Understanding these relationships is crucial in combating climate change, as aerosols, clouds, and phytoplankton interact in complex ways. For instance, aerosols can affect cloud formation, which in turn can impact phytoplankton growth.

PACE is not just a scientific mission; it's also a valuable tool for addressing the challenges our oceans face. With PACE, researchers can study climate change's impact on phytoplankton, which is essential for understanding the Earth system.

In a surprising turn of events, Google has revealed that Microsoft tried to sell its Bing search engine to Apple multiple times, but was rejected due to quality issues. This revelation has sparked questions about the quality of Bing's search results and whether Microsoft's efforts to promote it over Google were genuine or not.

According to court documents filed by Google in its antitrust case against the US Department of Justice, Microsoft approached Apple in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2020 to make Bing the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser. However, Apple declined each offer, citing concerns about Bing's quality.

Eddie Cue, Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, was quoted in Google's court filing as saying, ""Microsoft search quality, their investment in search, everything was not significant at all. And so everything was lower. So the search quality itself wasn’t as good. They weren’t investing at any level comparable to Google or to what Microsoft could invest in. And their advertising organization and how they monetize was not very good either.""

These comments raise questions about the quality of Bing's search results and whether Microsoft's efforts to promote it over Google were genuine or not. It's worth noting that Microsoft has not commented on the substance of Google's filing, so it's unclear what their response to these allegations would be.

The timing of this revelation is interesting, given the current state of the search engine market. Google dominates the market with over 90% share, while Bing lags behind with less than 4%. Additionally, the search industry is undergoing a significant shift with the slow death of tracking cookies and the emergence of AI-based search platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.

In a blog post, the company announced that the app will no longer be available for use starting June 4, 2024, and users will need to transfer their balance to another bank account or use the Google Pay website to manage their funds.

According to Google, the move is part of an effort to streamline its payment offerings, as the Google Wallet app is used five times more frequently in the US. The company is encouraging users to switch to Google Wallet, which offers similar features, such as the ability to store payment cards, loyalty cards, transit passes, and government identification.

However, it's worth noting that Google Wallet does not support peer-to-peer payments or cashback rewards, which were features available on Google Pay. Additionally, users who are waiting for cashback rewards from in-app deals will still receive their rewards according to the usual payment timelines, but they will need to access them through Google Search instead of the Google Pay app.

The decision to discontinue Google Pay in the US comes after the company has experimented with various mobile payment methods over the years. It appears that Google is settling on Google Wallet as its primary and default Android payments app, focusing on its simplicity and ease of use.

While the move may be inconvenient for some users, Google is providing guidance on how to transfer balances and navigate the change. It's unclear what will happen to the Google Pay app after June 4th, but it's likely that it will remain a window to view balances, but will no longer be operational.

The change does not affect users in Singapore and India, where Google Pay will continue to be fully functional.

Imagine a world where healthcare operates like Uber, where individuals and organizations freely transact, seeking better payoffs, and the laws of markets govern every transaction. This is the vision that Onur Ozcan and Benjamin Preston paint in their article, where they highlight the importance of markets in healthcare and how they can benefit society.

The first law of markets, according to Ozcan and Preston, is that market transactions make participants better off. In healthcare, this means that when faced with a last-minute patient cancellation, a physician can turn to virtual care marketplaces like Sesame Health and Amazon Clinic to serve a cash-pay patient during the appointed time. This transaction benefits both the physician and the patient, who can secure a same-day or same-hour appointment at an affordable price. However, for patients and providers prohibited by government regulations or insurance contracts from using such platforms, they lose an option and incur an opportunity cost.

The second law of markets is that market prices reflect collective wisdom and democratic valuation. Market prices incorporate every potential consumer's willingness to pay and every potential seller's willingness to accept, reflecting collective wisdom and valuation fairly and democratically. In contrast, prices set by government agencies are imposed through state power and designed by a small group of individuals with inferior knowledge compared to and self-interest imperfectly aligned with market participants. For instance, Medicare has been paying hospitals and testing labs $51 for a COVID-19 PCR test, which is much higher than its cost, resulting in a windfall for these providers at taxpayers' expense.

The third law of markets is that market signals guide optimal capital allocation. Healthcare AI has attracted enormous financial and human capital due to the strong signals sent by the healthcare AI market, reflecting consumers' high willingness to pay. This attracts entrepreneurs, investors, and talented individuals to enter the market, promoting innovation and competition to deliver better and cheaper products, optimally allocating both financial capital and human capital to advance consumers' collective interests.

Xiaomi's latest flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi 14, has been making waves in the tech community with its impressive camera system and sleek design. As a tech enthusiast, I had the opportunity to try out the device for five days, and I must say, I'm quite impressed.

One of the standout features of the Xiaomi 14 is its camera system, which boasts three 50MP rear cameras, borrowed from last year's Xiaomi 13 Pro. This setup allows for some amazing portrait shots with pleasing bokeh, thanks to the Leica-tuned colors and lenses with four focal lengths – 35mm, 50mm, 75mm, and 90mm. The camera system is so good that it can give even the best smartphone cameras a run for their money.

The 35mm and 75mm portrait shots are my personal favorites, as they capture great skin tones and natural-looking bokeh. However, the camera can struggle with moving subjects, and the edge detection in 50mm portraits isn't always perfect. But Xiaomi has promised to ship the phones with Motion Capture turned on by default, which should help with the former issue.

The ultrawide lens on the Xiaomi 14 is also a pleasant surprise, offering great dynamic range, color accuracy, and detail. It's not often that I use the ultrawide lens on my phones, but the Xiaomi 14 made me want to shoot more in this angle. The front camera, on the other hand, is average, with a 32MP selfie shooter that gets the job done but doesn't stand out from the competition.

In terms of design, the Xiaomi 14 feels premium and dense, with flat sides and subtle curves at the back for better ergonomics. The matte finish on the Black color variant is also a nice touch. The 6.36-inch AMOLED display is a joy to use, with a 2,670 x 1,200-pixel resolution, support for dynamic 120Hz refresh",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d9867476052cea1c69094d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-02-25 11:00:07
