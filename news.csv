In a world where digital photography reigns supreme, a refreshing wave of nostalgia is sweeping through the smartphone era. Lapse, a pioneering app, is rekindling the charm and simplicity of analog cameras, offering a unique experience that harkens back to the days of film photography.

With Lapse, you can capture moments without the instant gratification of editing or retaking shots. Instead, you'll embark on a journey of anticipation, waiting for your photos to ""develop"" before sharing them with a select group of friends.

This unique concept has resonated with millions of users, propelling Lapse to the top ranks of photographic apps in the U.S. app store. The app's popularity has attracted a new round of funding, amounting to $30 million, led by renowned investors Greylock and DST Global Partners.

Lapse's vision extends beyond mere photo-sharing. The app aims to enhance the overall photo experience with behind-the-scenes treatments, leveraging computer vision and proprietary technology to optimize the composition and aesthetics of your shots.

However, Lapse has faced scrutiny for these tactics, prompting a shift towards more user-friendly approaches.

The app's recent evolution has transformed it into a journaling platform, allowing users to create private or shareable albums with their close circle. This pivot has eliminated the need for forced invites, fostering organic growth and a sense of community.

Lapse's journey reflects a growing trend in the consumer app landscape. Users are becoming increasingly wary of the data they surrender to social media giants. This awareness has created an opportunity for apps like Lapse to offer simpler, more private alternatives.

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, Lapse stands as a beacon of authenticity and simplicity. Its success serves as a reminder that in a world saturated with bells and whistles, sometimes the most compelling experiences are the ones that take us back to our roots.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/alibaba-staff-offers-glimpse-into-life-of-llm-researcher-in-china/,Alibaba staffer offers a glimpse into building LLMs in China,"

In the realm of artificial intelligence, a captivating rivalry is unfolding between Chinese tech giants and their Western counterparts, particularly OpenAI. Alibaba, a prominent Chinese e-commerce company, recently unveiled a glimpse into the life of its Large Language Model (LLM) researchers, revealing striking similarities and notable differences in their work routines compared to their OpenAI peers.

Alibaba's Binyuan Hui, a natural language processing researcher, shared his daily schedule, mirroring that of OpenAI's Jason Wei. Both researchers start their day at 9 a.m. and work tirelessly until 1 a.m., dedicating their hours to meetings, coding, model training, and brainstorming with colleagues. Even after returning home, they continue their experiments and ponder over model enhancements late into the night.

Despite the similarities in their work schedules, there are distinct differences in their leisure time choices. Hui spends his free time reading research papers and catching up on global events on X, while Wei enjoys a glass of wine after work.

This intense work ethic is prevalent in China's LLM space, where top university graduates are flocking to tech companies to build competitive AI models. Hui's demanding schedule reflects a personal drive to match or surpass Silicon Valley companies in the AI arena, contrasting with the involuntary ""996"" work hours associated with traditional Chinese internet businesses.

Renowned AI investor and computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee also exemplifies this dedication. During an interview, Lee revealed that late hours were the norm at his newly established LLM unicorn 01.AI, with employees enthusiastically working hard.

The urgency of the tasks assigned by Chinese tech firms has led to a rapid rollout of LLMs. Alibaba's Qwen, for instance, has open-sourced foundation models trained with both English and Chinese data, with the largest model boasting 72 billion parameters. The team has also swiftly introduced commercial applications, integrating Qwen into Alibaba's enterprise communication platform and online retailer.

While no clear leader has emerged in China's LLM space, venture capital firms and corporate investors are spreading their bets across multiple contenders. Alibaba, in addition to developing its own LLM, has invested heavily in startups like Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, Baichuan, and 01.AI.

To differentiate itself from competitors, Alibaba is exploring a multilingual approach. In December, the company released SeaLLM, an LLM capable of processing information in several Southeast Asian languages. This move could become a selling point, leveraging Alibaba's cloud computing business and its acquisition of the e-commerce platform Lazada in the region.

Gene Therapy: A Beacon of Hope for Rett Syndrome

In the realm of rare childhood diseases, Rett syndrome stands out as a formidable challenge, affecting approximately one in 10,000 girls worldwide. This neurodevelopmental disorder disrupts brain development, leading to a range of debilitating symptoms that emerge after a period of seemingly normal growth. Speech, memory, coordination, and motor skills are profoundly affected, leaving individuals reliant on lifelong support and intervention.

While there is currently no cure for Rett syndrome, a glimmer of hope has emerged from the world of gene therapy. Researchers are exploring the potential of direct injection gene therapy to address the root cause of the condition. This approach aims to deliver a functional copy of the mutated gene directly into the brain, thereby restoring the production of essential proteins and alleviating the debilitating symptoms of Rett syndrome.

The Promise of Direct Injection

Conventional gene therapies often involve modifying a patient's cells in a lab and then reintroducing them into the body. However, this method poses several challenges, including the risk of liver toxicity and the high cost associated with cell manipulation.

Direct injection, on the other hand, offers a more targeted and cost-effective approach. By delivering the gene therapy directly to the brain, researchers can bypass the liver and minimize the risk of toxicity. Additionally, this method utilizes the patient's own cells to produce the therapeutic protein, eliminating the need for expensive cell manipulation outside the body.

Preclinical Success: Paving the Way for Human Trials

In a preclinical study, researchers in Shanghai, China, demonstrated the potential of direct injection gene therapy in mouse models of Rett syndrome. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, they simulated the mutated gene expression seen in patients with Rett syndrome. The mice were then treated with a gene therapy packaged into a viral vector and injected directly into their brains.

The results were promising. The treatment partially restored MeCP2 protein levels in the brain, leading to a significant increase in lifespan and improved motor function in the mice. Notably, the researchers found that a specific promoter, cytomegalovirus early enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG), outperformed other promoters in driving gene expression and extending the lifespan of the mice.

A Future Free from Rett Syndrome

While human testing is still needed to fully evaluate the potential of direct injection gene therapy for Rett syndrome, the preclinical findings offer a beacon of hope for patients and their families. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of Rett syndrome, providing a simple, cost-effective, and targeted therapy that addresses the root cause of the condition.

The success of direct injection gene therapy in preclinical studies echoes the promise of this approach in other areas of medicine, including aggressive ovarian treatment and in vivo CAR T therapy for leukemias and lymphomas. As research continues, we can look forward to a future where Rett syndrome is a thing of the past and affected individuals can live full and fulfilling lives.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-and-elon-musk-can-set-up-windows-11-without-a-microsoft-account/,How you (and Elon Musk) can set up Windows 11 without a Microsoft account,"

Elon Musk, the tech tycoon, recently faced a common struggle: installing Windows 11. When prompted to create a Microsoft account, he expressed his discomfort with granting access to his computer to Microsoft's AI program, Copilot.

Musk is not alone in his objection. Many users have voiced their concerns about the mandatory inclusion of Copilot in Windows 11. Prior to the September 2023 update, Copilot was optional, but now it's an integral part of the operating system.

While there are ways to temporarily disable Copilot through settings, it remains embedded within the system. To permanently remove its functionality, users must navigate through the Group Policy or Registry Editor, which can be daunting for those unfamiliar with these tools.

Musk, being the resourceful individual he is, reached out to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for assistance. Alternatively, he could have consulted Windows expert Ed Bott, who has addressed this issue previously. Bott suggests using a dummy Microsoft account like ""no@thankyou.com"" to bypass the mandatory account creation.

However, using a local account instead of a Microsoft account comes with a trade-off: the system's drive will not be automatically encrypted. Users can manually encrypt their drives using BitLocker or other encryption programs, but it's an extra step that some may find inconvenient.

For those already using Windows 11 with a Microsoft account and seeking to switch to a local account, the process is relatively straightforward. Users can navigate to Settings > Accounts > Your Info and follow the prompts to convert to a local account.

If the concerns about Microsoft AI and Windows persist, there's always the option of switching to Desktop Linux. Musk's companies, including X, SpaceX, and Tesla, rely on Linux, so it might be a suitable alternative for his desktop as well.

A word of caution, though: Linux creator Linus Torvalds is known for his aversion to end-user tech support requests.

In the end, the choice between using Windows 11 with Copilot or opting for a different operating system is a personal one. Users must weigh the pros and cons, considering factors like AI integration, data encryption, and personal preferences.

In the realm of artificial intelligence, Google's Gemini AI model has sparked a whirlwind of reactions, ranging from amusement to outrage. The model's controversial outputs, including a bizarre comparison between Elon Musk's tweets and Hitler's actions, have ignited a fierce debate about the ethics and accuracy of AI-generated content.

This backlash stands in stark contrast to the initial excitement surrounding Gemini's release in December, when many hailed it as a potential rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, the model's recent missteps have raised concerns about Google's approach to AI development and its ability to balance innovation with responsibility.

The crux of the issue lies in the inherent tension between Google's desire for speed and its need to appease users. The company's eagerness to compete with OpenAI may have led to a hasty release of Gemini, resulting in the embarrassing blunders that have plagued the model.

Google's cautious approach to AI development, influenced by its massive user base and brand reputation, has been further complicated by the emergence of smaller, more agile startups like OpenAI. These companies, unburdened by the same legacy and expectations, have been more willing to push the boundaries of AI technology, even at the risk of controversy.

The recent issues with Gemini underscore the challenges faced by all LLM (Large Language Model) companies. Hallucinations, or nonsensical outputs, are an inherent limitation of current AI technology. Even ChatGPT, the current darling of the AI world, has been known to generate gibberish responses.

The expectation that Google's LLM outputs should please everyone is unrealistic and unattainable. There is no single, universally agreed-upon set of social, cultural, and political values that an AI chatbot could adhere to. This inherent subjectivity makes it impossible for Google to satisfy all users, regardless of how carefully it fine-tunes its models.

Caught between the need for innovation and the fear of backlash, Google finds itself in a precarious position. The company's massive scale and legacy make it a target for criticism, while its competitors, with fewer constraints, can move more nimbly in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

As the AI revolution continues to unfold, Google must navigate these challenges with wisdom and agility. It must strike a delicate balance between pushing the boundaries of technology and addressing the ethical and societal concerns that arise along the way.
