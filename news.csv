Tesla abandons $25K EV plans, focusing on robotaxis instead. The shift may be due to factory location changes and competitive pricing strategies.","Title: Tesla's Shifting Focus: From Affordable EVs to Robotaxis

Tesla, known for its innovative electric vehicles (EVs), has reportedly abandoned plans to build a more affordable EV, which was expected to be priced around $25,000. According to Reuters, the company will instead concentrate its efforts on a planned robotaxi, sharing the same platform that was initially intended for the budget-friendly vehicle.

Initially, Tesla had been working on both vehicles for a few years. However, CEO Elon Musk has frequently wavered between prioritizing a traditional car or one sans steering wheel or pedals. Despite Musk's initial enthusiasm for an affordable Tesla, the project was reportedly put on hold in early 2022, only to be revived later.

In Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, the CEO expressed his desire to build a clean robotaxi despite his engineers' insistence on referencing a car with conventional controls. Musk declared that the robotaxi would ""transform everything"" and catapult Tesla to a ""ten-trillion [dollar] company."" However, the project's lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, and engineering VP, Lars Moravy, maintained a more traditional car version as a ""shadow project.""

In late 2022, Moravy and von Holzhausen pitched the idea of an affordable, compact car to Musk, asserting that it was essential for achieving the CEO's goal of 50% annual growth. They also proposed using the same platform to develop both models. Despite Musk's lukewarm response, he eventually agreed to the plan in 2023.

However, recent developments have cast doubt on this decision. Citing internal documents, Reuters reports that Tesla has stopped working on the traditional car project in favor of the robotaxi approach. The shift in focus may be attributed to Musk's plans to construct a factory in Mexico to manufacture both vehicles, which he later changed to Texas. Additionally, Tesla's aggressive pricing strategy in China and its efforts to maintain a competitive edge over rivals outside of China may have also influenced this decision.

Although the affordable EV is temporarily on hold, Tesla's shift towards robotaxis signifies the company's commitment","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1245135186.jpg?resize=1200,756",2024-04-05 16:45:17,"""Discover Tesla's shift towards robotaxis: Safer, efficient transportation reshaping the future of mobility.

The online dating scene is a bustling, competitive space, with a significant amount of mergers and acquisitions taking place over the years. With this in mind, our interest was piqued when we came across Queerie, a dating app specifically designed for the LGBTQIA+ community. As an early-stage company seeking to raise $300,000, Queerie has shared its full pitch deck with TechCrunch, allowing us to examine the unique aspects of this innovative platform.

An Engaging Pitch Deck

First and foremost, Queerie's pitch deck stands out due to its fresh and inviting design, coupled with engaging language and graphics. This serves as a strong foundation for any consumer brand, offering a clean, simple, and enjoyable user experience.

Mission Statement and Problem Identification

Queerie's mission statement is prominently displayed, appealing to mission-driven investors and addressing the challenges faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. By identifying isolation and mental health issues within queer spaces, the app aims to tackle these problems and provide a solution for loneliness.

Areas for Improvement

Despite the potential of Queerie, there are some aspects of the pitch that can be improved to increase its fundability.

1. Diverse Representation

For a company focused on inclusivity, the lack of female representation on the team raises questions. Diversifying the team can help create a broader perspective and ensure that the app caters to a wider audience.

2. Appropriate Team Structure

The team's extensive experience in the dating world is valuable, but there appears to be an overemphasis on technical skills, with a notable absence of sales and marketing expertise. Balancing the team with a seasoned marketer would increase credibility and ensure a more comprehensive approach to building a successful company.

3. Innovation and Differentiation

The pitch deck lacks a clear explanation of Queerie's unique selling points, making it difficult for potential investors to see why this app will succeed where others have not. Highlighting the app's innovative features is crucial for attracting investment.

4. Traction and Metrics

While it's great that Queerie has 95 beta testers, the pitch deck fails to provide essential","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pitch-Deck-Teardown-2024-queerie.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-05 16:00:41,"Meta Description: Refine Queerie's pitch deck to secure $300,000: Improve team diversity, emphasize innovation, showcase traction, ensure realistic financial projections.

Summary

Human2HumanOid (H2O), a scalable reinforcement learning-based framework developed by Carnegie Mellon University, enables the teleoperation of full-sized humanoid robots in real-time. The method addresses the challenges of teleoperation, including the need for sophisticated hardware and difficulty in translating human movements to robots in real-time. The H2O framework uses a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology that retargets human motions to humanoid capabilities, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints. The refined motion dataset then trains a reinforcement learning-based motion imitator in simulation, which is subsequently transferred to the real robot without further adjustment. The H2O framework could soon be used to train robots on numerous real-world tasks, such as replicating complex motions and performing risky procedures remotely.","Title: Teleoperating Humanoid Robots with Human2HumanOid: A New Era of Remote Manual Task Completion

Introduction

Imagine a world where humans can complete a wide range of manual tasks remotely, including risky and complex procedures. This is no longer a distant reality, thanks to the concept of teleoperation, which involves operating robots from a distance. A recent advancement in this field is the development of Human2HumanOid (H2O) by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. This method allows for the effective teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots, enabling the training of humanoid robots on manual tasks requiring specific sets of movements.

The Challenge of Teleoperation

Teleoperation has been a topic of interest for quite some time, with the potential to revolutionize various industries. However, several challenges have hindered its progress. These challenges include the need for sophisticated hardware, limited scalability, and the difficulty of translating human movements to robots in real-time. The H2O method addresses these challenges by relying only on an RGB camera, making it scalable and widely applicable.

The H2O Method

H2O is a scalable and efficient method that facilitates the teleoperation of full-sized humanoid robots in real-time. It relies on a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology that retargets human motions to humanoid capabilities, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints. The refined motion dataset then trains a reinforcement learning (RL)-based motion imitator in simulation, which is subsequently transferred to the real robot without further adjustment.

Advantages of H2O

The H2O method has several advantages. It allows robots to perform a wide array of dynamic whole-body motions in real-time, despite its minimal hardware requirements. The system's other components include a retargeting algorithm and a method to clean human motion data in simulations, ensuring that motions can be effectively replicated in robots. The most notable achievement of the study is the successful demonstration of learning-based, real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation, a first of its kind.

Real-World Applications

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/threads-missed-its-earthquake-moment-as-the-term-didnt-trend-until-the-afternoon/,Meta explains why the NYC/NJ earthquake didn't trend earlier in the day," Meta's Instagram Threads: Challenged by Real-Time Trending, Regional Events ","Instagram Threads: A Work in Progress

Instagram Threads, Meta's response to Twitter, has yet to find its footing, particularly when it comes to real-time trending topics. On Friday, when the New York/New Jersey area was hit by an earthquake, users flocked to Twitter to discuss the event. The hashtag earthquake quickly climbed to the top of Twitter's Trends section, accompanied by related terms such as ""East Coast,"" ""Long Island,"" ""Philly,"" ""Manhattan,"" and ""Brooklyn."" On the other hand, earthquake-related terms did not appear on Threads' trends section until much later in the day.

However, this does not mean that the earthquake was not being discussed on Threads. Many users were having conversations about the earthquake, tagging their posts as ""EarthquakeThreads"" or ""NYC Threads"" to increase visibility within the Threads community. The issue lies in the fact that Threads does not use hashtags, which can make it less clear how to tag trending topics. This leads to varying tagging conventions, such as ""earthquake,"" ""earthquake,"" or ""Earthquake Threads,"" making it difficult for a single term to gain enough traction to appear in Threads' top trends.

When TechCrunch reached out to Instagram regarding the earthquake's absence from Threads' top trends, they explained that trends are based on national conversations and various signals, including the number of people talking about a topic and engaging with related posts. Since the earthquake was a regional event, it may have simply taken more time for enough people to join the conversation for it to appear in the top trends.

Unfortunately, Threads' inability to keep up with real-time trends could hinder its potential to compete with Twitter fully. Additionally, Meta's plan to distance itself from political content on Instagram and Threads may further limit its ability to surpass Twitter, even if it incorporates similar features such as reposts, search, bookmarks, and linkable tags.

Instagram Threads, Meta's response to Twitter, has yet to find its footing, particularly when it comes to real-time trending topics. This article highlights a regional earthquake that occurred in the New York/New Jersey area, analyzing the difference in how Threads and Twitter handled the real-time trends.

The story starts with the earthquake, which trended on Twitter quickly. However, the same cannot be said for Threads. The analysis shows that Threads' lack of a consistent tagging system and focus on real-time updates hinders its ability to compete with Twitter's real-time trending capabilities.

Meta's decision to distance itself from political content on Instagram and Threads may also affect its ability to surpass Twitter in real-time trending topics. This article also discusses how Threads can improve its capabilities to catch up with Twitter in delivering real-time updates.

In summary, the New York/New Jersey earthquake on Friday highlighted the difference in handling real-time trends between Instagram Threads and Twitter. With a more consistent tagging system and a stronger focus on real-time updates, Threads could potentially narrow the gap in user engagement and trending topic visibility.

Introduction

Social network X has recently announced that they are expanding access to their xAI-powered Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers. This move comes after Elon Musk's announcement last month, making the chatbot available to an even wider audience. Let's delve into the details of this new development and what it means for users.

Grok Chatbot: Now Accessible to Premium Users

Previously, only Premium+ users had the privilege to interact with the Grok chatbot, which was launched by xAI last year. With the latest update, Social network X is now offering Grok chatbot access to users with a Premium subscription ($8 per month) in select regions. This is an exciting opportunity for more users to explore and benefit from this advanced technology.

Using Grok Chatbot: Regular Mode vs. Fun Mode

Grok chatbot offers two modes for users: Regular mode and Fun mode. Users can engage with the chatbot in either mode while being aware that, as with any Large Language Model (LLM) product, there is a possibility of inaccurate answers. Unfortunately, there have been instances where Grok generated misleading information, such as a fake headline about Iran striking Tel Aviv with heavy missiles. However, Social network X and xAI are continuously working to improve the chatbot's performance and accuracy.

Grok vs. Competitors: A Battle for AI Supremacy

Elon Musk's recent open criticism of OpenAI's operations and his subsequent lawsuit against the company over ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goal might have motivated him to push for Grok's expansion. Musk is keen on promoting Grok chatbot as a strong competitor to other AI chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude.

Open-Sourcing Grok: Questions Remain

While xAI has open-sourced Grok, some questions still need answers. For example, there is no information about the latest version of the model, and the company has not provided any details about the training data used. My colleague Devin Coldewey rightly points out that transparency in the development and training data processes is crucial","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-06 05:55:24," Meta Description:

Spotify has been subtly working behind the scenes to bring artists and fans closer together since the shutdown of its live audio app. This time, the company has introduced an exciting feature called ""Listening Party,"" which enables high-engaging fans to join album release events by their favorite artists and even interact with them.

The Listening Party feature has been in a testing phase in the United States and Indonesia since December 2023, with plans to expand to additional markets soon. According to a Spotify spokesperson, they have been testing the feature with several artists, including Zara Larsson and Bleachers, in its early stages.

Located under the events section of an artist's profile, Listening Parties are accessible to any Spotify Premium user, not just the artist's top fans. Spotify has yet to explicitly define what constitutes a top fan, only mentioning those who have ""demonstrated an affinity for the artist over time."" During a session, fans can request to join the artist ""on stage"" for real-time interaction, and there is also a live chat room available during the event for fans to engage with one another.

In addition to strengthening fan-artist connections, Spotify is also integrating the Listening Party feature with its merchandise sales. Last year, the company introduced an in-app Merch Hub, giving fans personalized recommendations to purchase items from their favorite artists. By combining group listening and live audio interactions, Spotify aims to create a more engaging experience for its users.

Besides the Listening Party feature, Spotify has been focusing on growing direct engagement between fans and artists in other ways, such as merchandise sales, events, and ticketing. Although Spotify's live audio app is no longer active, the company continues to explore innovative ways to bridge the gap between fans and artists. The Listening Party feature is an excellent example of how Spotify is leveraging technology to build stronger connections and communities within its platform.

Just a day after Elon Musk dismissed claims from Reuters about abandoning its low-cost EV project, the Tesla CEO took to his social media platform, X, to announce an event on August 8, where he will unveil the company's much-anticipated robotaxi. This announcement comes as Tesla has been facing challenges in maintaining strong EV sales and profit margins, making it imperative for the company to find new avenues for growth and innovation.

According to an earlier Reuters report, citing three anonymous sources and internal documents, Tesla has decided to shift its focus from the low-cost EV to developing a robotaxi built on the same platform initially intended for the budget electric vehicle. Musk quickly disputed Reuters' claims on X, asserting that the news organization was ""lying"" without providing any specifics. A few hours later, Musk confirmed the robotaxi unveiling, scheduled for August 8.

Rumors of Tesla working on a robotaxi have circulated for years, as the company has been exploring the possibility of launching a vehicle without a steering wheel or pedals. Musk has been vocal about his ambitions for autonomous capabilities in Tesla vehicles. In 2016, he predicted that a Tesla would drive cross-country without human intervention by the end of 2017, a goal that failed to materialize.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/,Price of zero-day exploits rises as companies harden products against hackers, Zero-Day Exploits Skyrocket: Multi-Million Dollar Hacking Arms Race ,"Title: The Soaring Value of Zero-Day Exploits in a Security Arms Race

In the world of cybersecurity, the race between hackers and software developers is a constant tug-of-war. As companies harden their products against cyber intrusions, the price of zero-day exploits has surged, reaching multi-million-dollar figures. Crowdfense, a startup that acquires and resells these exploits, recently unveiled its updated price list, revealing staggering sums for hacking tools targeting popular devices and applications.

Originally known as ""zero-day vulnerabilities,"" these exploits rely on unpatched software bugs, unknown to the makers of the affected software. Companies like Crowdfense and Zerodium purchase these zero-days with the intent of reselling them to government agencies and contractors, which claim the tools are essential for monitoring and combating criminal activities.

Crowdfense's new price list reflects the growing challenge of hacking secure devices and applications. The company now offers between $5 and $7 million for zero-days targeting iPhones, up to $5 million for Android phones, and up to $3.5 million for Chrome and Safari exploits. WhatsApp and iMessage zero-days are valued at $3 to $5 million. In their previous price list, published in 2019, Crowdfense's highest payouts were $3 million for Android and iOS exploits.

The increased prices can be attributed to the heightened security measures implemented by companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft. These improvements make it more difficult for attackers to breach their devices and apps, ultimately protecting users. Dustin Childs, the head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, explains, ""It should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we’re using, whatever devices we’re using.""

Google's Threat Analysis Group reported that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild in 2023, with 75% targeting Google products and Android. Spyware vendors, often working with zero-day brokers, were responsible for the majority of these attacks. Security analyst David Manouchehri notes that hacking ""hard targets"" like Google's Pixel and the iPhone has become increasingly difficult.

In response to growing concerns about the impact of Snapchat's ""Solar System"" feature on teenagers' mental health, the social media giant has decided to make some adjustments. This adjustment comes shortly after The Wall Street Journal reported that the feature was causing anxiety among teens.

The ""Solar System"" feature in Snapchat ranks paid subscribers' friends based on their engagement levels. The closer a friend is to you in the solar system, the more frequently you communicate with them. However, this system can lead to hurt feelings and misunderstandings, as it may not accurately reflect real-world relationships.

Snapchat has acknowledged the feedback that while it can be nice to know you're close to someone, it can also be disheartening to realize you're not as close as you'd like to be. In a bid to address these concerns, the company announced that it would turn off the ""Solar System"" feature by default for Snapchat+ subscribers. However, users can still enable it if they wish.

While this move may provide some friction, it's unlikely to deter teenagers from re-enabling the feature if they want to use it. Snapchat has defended the feature, stating that it's not widely used, with less than 0.25% of the community utilizing it. However, since it's only available to paid subscribers, a more relevant statistic would be the percentage of Snapchat+ users who have used the feature.

The ""Solar System"" feature is just one of Snapchat's many friend-ranking systems. Another feature, called ""Best Friends,"" puts the people with whom users communicate most at the top of their contact list, along with a heart or smiley emoji. The much-debated ""Streaks"" feature encourages repeated use of the app by offering a visual representation of how many consecutive days users have stayed in touch with one another.

Snapchat has promised to mitigate the potential downsides of online communication, but it has built features and tools that have left it open to lawsuits and Congressional inquiry. While the company has taken a step in the right direction by turning off the ""Solar System"" feature by default, it's clear","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Evan-Spiegel-SnapDSC04002.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 23:38:52,"""Snapchat adjusts 'Solar System' feature, addressing user concerns for teen mental health.

Tesla is gearing up to unveil its much-anticipated robotaxi on August 8, as announced by CEO Elon Musk, following a Reuters report claiming that the automaker has abandoned its plans to manufacture a budget-friendly electric vehicle (EV). Musk quickly responded to the report, denying the claims and labeling the news organization's statements as false.

Reuters reported that Musk had issued a directive to focus solely on developing robotaxis based on Tesla's compact-vehicle platform. Tesla enthusiasts have eagerly awaited the arrival of an affordable EV, with Musk previously expressing optimism that the model would debut in the second half of 2025 with a starting price of $25,000.

Musk took to Twitter to refute the Reuters report, stating, ""Reuters is lying (again)."" Although he did not specify which portion of the article was incorrect, he confirmed the unveiling of the robotaxi, suggesting that the report's claim regarding the discontinuation of an affordable EV might have been inaccurate.

Currently, Tesla's least expensive vehicle is the Model 3, with a starting price of $39,000. The robotaxi is expected to utilize Tesla's camera-only system, devoid of radar and other sensors that companies such as Waymo heavily rely on for their driver assistance technologies. This development raises questions about the feasibility of implementing a robotaxi with the existing camera-only system.

In a recent interview, Musk stated that Tesla's robotaxis would be ""essentially at the level where you can trust them with your own life"" within the next few years, adding that ""you could go from your parking lot to work without having to drive.""

With the robotaxi launch just around the corner, Tesla has yet to address the ambiguity surrounding its plans for an affordable EV, leaving fans and industry observers to speculate on the future direction of the company's EV offerings.

In conclusion, Tesla's robotaxi introduction is generating excitement, despite the confusion regarding the company's commitment to developing a more budget-friendly EV.
