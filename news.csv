https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/meta-privacy-fee-eu-assessment/,EU signals doubts over legality of Meta's privacy fee," EU Challenges Meta's Privacy Fee, Enforcing Digital Rules ","

EU Cracks Down on Meta's Privacy Fee

The European Union (EU) has taken a strong stance against Meta's controversial ""consent or pay"" tactic, which forces users in the EU to either pay a monthly subscription or agree to tracking on Facebook and Instagram. This move signals a clear message that the EU will not tolerate attempts to circumvent its digital governance and competition rules.

EU's Digital Market Rules

The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies and promote fair competition in digital markets. Meta, designated as a ""gatekeeper"" under the DMA, must comply with strict rules, including limitations on the use of personal data for advertising.

The Digital Services Act (DSA) complements the DMA by imposing obligations on very large online platforms (VLOPs) like Facebook and Instagram. VLOPs must obtain clear consent from users for processing data for advertising purposes.

Meta's ""Consent or Pay"" Tactic

Meta's privacy fee has sparked outrage among privacy advocates and consumer protection organizations. They argue that it is an unfair tactic that forces users to pay for their privacy or be subjected to intrusive tracking.

The EU has responded by sending a formal request for information to Meta, seeking clarification on its compliance with the DSA. The Commission has also expressed concerns that the privacy fee may violate the DMA's prohibition on economic coercion to obtain consent.

EU's Enforcement Actions

The EU has indicated that it is prepared to take enforcement actions against Meta if it finds that the company is not complying with the DMA or DSA. Penalties for violations can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover.

The Commission has also emphasized the importance of protecting children's privacy. Targeted advertising is prohibited for minors, and Meta must ensure that minors are not presented with the ""consent or pay"" option.

Conclusion

The EU's actions against Meta's privacy fee send a clear message that tech giants must abide by the spirit and letter of the law. The EU is committed to protecting the privacy of its citizens and ensuring fair competition in digital markets. Meta and other gatekeepers must adapt their business practices to comply with these rules or face significant consequences.

Solana: The Blockchain Making Waves in Crypto

In the bustling world of cryptocurrencies, the spotlight often falls on Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a lesser-known blockchain, Solana, is quietly making a splash.

What's the Buzz About Solana?

Solana has recently experienced a surge in popularity, driven by its impressive price gains. TechCrunch attributes this rise to a familiar phenomenon: the return of a past trend.

Dogwifhat and Bonk: The Secret Sauce

Remember Dogwifhat and Bonk? These playful terms have become synonymous with Solana's recent success. While the details remain shrouded in mystery, it's clear that these concepts have sparked a renewed interest in the blockchain.

Substance vs. Hype

While price pumps are exciting, it's important to question whether the current crypto boom has a solid foundation. Solana's rise has been largely driven by nostalgia rather than groundbreaking innovation.

A Word of Caution

This isn't to say that Solana is without merit. However, it's worth approaching the current hype with a grain of caution. Without a clear roadmap for innovation, the crypto market may be vulnerable to a repeat of past bubbles.

Conclusion

Solana's recent success is a testament to the cyclical nature of the crypto industry. While it's tempting to get caught up in the excitement, it's crucial to remember that long-term success in this volatile market requires a balance of hype and substance.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/apex-legends-hacker-said-he-hacked-tournament-games-for-fun/,Apex Legends hacker said he hacked tournament games 'for fun', Apex Legends Tournament Disrupted by Hacker Exposing Game Vulnerability ,"

Apex Legends Tournament Rocked by Mid-Game Hacking

The world of gaming was thrown into chaos recently when a high-stakes Apex Legends tournament was disrupted by a brazen hacking incident. During the event, hackers infiltrated the games of two renowned streamers, effectively taking control mid-game.

""I'm getting hacked!"" exclaimed one of the victims during a live broadcast. ""This is crazy!""

The incident forced the tournament organizers to postpone the event indefinitely, citing concerns about the integrity of the competition. The hackers, using the aliases ""Destroyer2009"" and ""R4andom,"" displayed messages on the game's chatbox, announcing their presence.

The Hacker's Motive

Destroyer2009, in an interview, claimed responsibility for the hacks. He stated that his actions were driven by a desire to expose a vulnerability in the game and compel the developers to address it. He declined to provide specific details about the exploit, but emphasized that it did not involve accessing the server or hacking the players' computers.

Community Concerns

The hacks sent shockwaves through the Apex Legends community. Players expressed fears about the security of the game and the potential for their own computers to be compromised. Destroyer2009 downplayed these concerns, asserting that the hacks were isolated incidents and that he had no malicious intent.

Developer Response

Respawn Entertainment, the developer of Apex Legends, released a statement acknowledging the incident and announcing the deployment of updates to enhance player protection. The statement did not provide specific details about the updates or the nature of the vulnerabilities exploited.

Anti-Cheat Measures

Easy Anti-Cheat, the developer of the anti-cheat engine used in Apex Legends, stated that it was confident there were no remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities being exploited. RCE vulnerabilities allow hackers to execute malicious code on target devices remotely, posing a significant security risk.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/frontline-ventures-seed-growth/,Frontline Ventures raises $200M to help B2B companies in Europe and US straddle the Atlantic, Frontline Ventures Raises $200M for Transatlantic Tech Expansion ,"

Europe's Hidden Gem: Why VCs Are Betting on Transatlantic Tech

In a global investment landscape marked by uncertainty, Europe has emerged as a beacon of resilience and long-term promise. This has not gone unnoticed by savvy venture capital firms, who are increasingly turning their attention to transatlantic opportunities.

Frontline Ventures: A Bridge Across the Atlantic

Frontline Ventures, a leading VC firm with a proven track record in both Europe and North America, has recently raised $200 million across two new funds: Frontline Growth and Frontline Seed. This strategic move underscores the firm's belief in the untapped potential of European tech companies and the value of expanding into the U.S. market.

Europe: An Undervalued Market with Global Impact

While Europe may not always garner the same headlines as its American counterpart, its tech ecosystem is far from stagnant. Despite a recent slowdown in venture investment, European startups still managed to raise more capital in 2022 than they did in 2019.

Importantly, European B2B software companies have a remarkable global footprint. Brennan O'Donnell, co-lead of Frontline Growth, highlights that over 30% of the revenue generated by top-performing B2B software companies at IPO comes from Europe. This statistic belies the notion that Europe is an undervalued market and emphasizes the potential for U.S. scaleups to expand their reach across the Atlantic.

Frontline's Expansion Roadmap

Frontline Ventures has developed a comprehensive roadmap to guide its portfolio companies through the complexities of international expansion. This framework focuses on four key aspects:

1. Timing: Determining the optimal moment to expand.
2. Go-to-Market Strategy: Developing a tailored plan for entering a new market.
3. Talent: Identifying and acquiring the right talent to support expansion.
4. Organizational Design and Location: Establishing a presence that aligns with customer needs and talent availability.

Success Stories: Lattice and Vanta

Frontline Ventures has already successfully applied this framework, helping portfolio companies like Lattice and Vanta navigate their expansion into Europe.

Lattice, an HR software company, expanded during the pandemic when travel was limited. However, Frontline recognized the tailwinds for HR tech and guided Lattice's expansion, which proved highly successful.

Vanta, a compliance platform, also benefited from Frontline's expertise. Christina Cacioppo, Vanta's co-founder and CEO, credits Frontline with helping the company triple its customer base, quadruple its team, and establish itself as a global market leader.

Building a Transatlantic Network

Beyond its partners and offices in key locations, Frontline Ventures has cultivated a network of executives in Europe and the Middle East. This network provides portfolio companies with access to valuable insights and potential partnerships.

Looking Ahead: IPOs and Seed Investments

Frontline Ventures anticipates an IPO within the next 18 months from its current portfolio. While seed investments may take longer to reach the exit stage, Frontline is committed to supporting its companies through each phase of growth.

The firm's strong track record in helping companies raise Series A funding is particularly noteworthy in the current investment climate. This support can be invaluable for European startups aiming to become transatlantic scaleups or even IPO candidates.

Conclusion

Europe's tech ecosystem is poised for continued growth and impact on the global stage. By embracing transatlantic opportunities and leveraging the expertise of firms like Frontline Ventures, European startups can unlock their full potential and become global leaders. The future of tech is not confined to one continent but rather lies in the seamless integration of innovation across borders.

Greenly: Empowering Businesses to Tackle Climate Change

The fight against climate change requires collective action, and major corporations have taken the lead by setting ambitious net-zero emissions targets. While these targets alone won't solve the crisis, they have sparked a ripple effect throughout the supply chain. Companies of all sizes are now recognizing the importance of reducing their carbon footprint.

For smaller businesses, navigating the complexities of carbon accounting can be daunting. Enter Greenly, a Paris-based startup that has developed innovative software to simplify this process. Greenly's software seamlessly integrates with various data sources, including utility bills, freight records, and cloud usage, to calculate carbon emissions by category and scope.

""We empower small and medium-sized businesses to meet their sustainability obligations at an affordable price,"" explains Alexis Normand, Greenly's CEO.

Greenly's business has experienced rapid growth, with annual recurring revenue exceeding $10 million last year. The company aims to double this revenue annually for the foreseeable future. To achieve these ambitious goals, Greenly is expanding its offerings beyond company-level carbon accounting.

Life cycle assessments, which evaluate the environmental impact of individual products throughout their entire lifecycle, are becoming increasingly important in certain industries. However, manual assessments can be time-consuming and complex. Greenly's automation-driven approach streamlines this process, enabling smaller companies to tackle these assessments more efficiently and comprehensively.

""In industries like manufacturing, construction, and garments, providing carbon footprints for products is becoming a requirement,"" says Normand. ""Greenly's technology empowers businesses to meet these demands.""

To fuel these initiatives, Greenly recently secured $52 million in Series B funding, led by Fidelity International Strategic Ventures. The company's fundraising success underscores the growing investor appetite for climate tech solutions.

Greenly's success is not only a testament to its innovative technology but also to the changing attitudes towards climate tech investments. Venture capitalists are recognizing the market potential of businesses focused on sustainability, which bodes well for the entire sector.

As Greenly continues to grow, its mission remains clear: to empower businesses of all sizes to become part of the solution to climate change. By providing accessible and affordable carbon accounting tools, Greenly is helping to create a more sustainable future for all.

Bugs, Beware! GitHub's Code-Scanning Autofix Is Here

Attention, coders! Today's a landmark day in the war against pesky bugs. GitHub has just unleashed the beta version of its code-scanning autofix feature, a game-changer for finding and squashing security vulnerabilities before they wreak havoc.

This cutting-edge tool is a fusion of GitHub's lightning-fast Copilot and CodeQL, the company's code analysis powerhouse. Remember when GitHub gave us a sneak peek last November? Well, it's finally here, and it's ready to revolutionize your coding experience.

Prepare to be amazed! Code-scanning autofix can handle over two-thirds of the vulnerabilities it detects, often without you lifting a finger. And get this: it covers a whopping 90% of alert types in JavaScript, Typescript, Java, and Python.

What's the Secret Sauce?

Under the hood, this feature relies on CodeQL, the code analysis engine that's like a microscope for your code. It hunts down vulnerabilities before they even have a chance to execute.

GitHub acquired the brilliant minds behind CodeQL in 2019, and since then, they've been refining it like a fine wine. Now, it's the cornerstone of this game-changing tool.

But wait, there's more! Code-scanning autofix also taps into GitHub Copilot's APIs and a dash of clever heuristics to suggest fixes. And to top it off, it uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate clear explanations for its recommendations.

Benefits Galore

For developers, code-scanning autofix is like a trusty sidekick, freeing you from tedious bug-hunting and giving you back precious time to focus on the creative stuff.

Security teams, rejoice! This feature will reduce your vulnerability workload, allowing you to focus on high-level strategies that keep your code safe and sound.

Availability

This exciting new feature is now open for business to all GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) customers. So, if you're ready to give your code a thorough checkup and say goodbye to pesky bugs, head on over to GitHub and give it a try!

Conclusion

GitHub's code-scanning autofix is a quantum leap forward in coding efficiency and security. It's like having a superpower at your fingertips, helping you write cleaner, more secure code with lightning speed. So, embrace this game-changer and let the bug-hunting adventures begin!
