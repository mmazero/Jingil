https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/tesla-abandons-low-cost-ev-robotaxi/,Tesla reportedly drops plan to build $25K EV,"

Conflicting reports emerge as Tesla allegedly abandons low-cost EV plans, focusing on robotaxi development. ","

In a surprise move, Tesla has reportedly abandoned plans to develop a lower-cost electric vehicle (EV) that was set to be priced around $25,000, according to Reuters. Instead, the company will focus on its plans to build a robotaxi that will be built on the same EV platform as the low-cost car.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has denied any wrongdoing and has also claimed that Reuters is ""lying,"" but has not provided any specific details to back up his claims. The company has been working on the robotaxi and the low-cost car for several years, but Musk has wavered on whether to prioritize a traditional car or a car with no steering wheel or pedals.

Despite not yet producing a fully autonomous car, Musk first teased the idea of a truly low-cost Tesla in 2020. However, by early 2022, he said the company had stopped work on the car because it had too much else to do. But that didn't last long, and the project was spun back up, but the company and its CEO were split on whether it should be a traditional car or a futuristic robotaxi.

In Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Musk, he described the CEO pushing back in mid-2022 against his engineers' insistence on referencing a car with a steering wheel and pedals. ""This vehicle must be designed as a clean robotaxi. We're going to take that risk, it's my fault if it fucks up,"" quoted Musk as saying. A few weeks after that, Isaacson said, he quoted Musk saying the robotaxi would ""transform everything"" and make Tesla a ""ten-trillion [dollar] company.""

However, even after all that, Isaacson wrote that lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy kept the more traditional car version alive as a ""shadow project."" In September 2022, Isaacson wrote, Moravy and von Holzhausen made the pitch to Musk that they needed an inexpensive, small car in order to grow at Musk's stated goal of 50% per year. They also laid out the plan to use the same platform to power both distinct models.

Musk still said, according to Isaacson, that the $25,000 car was ""really not that exciting of a project"" - despite it being the ultimate goal of his famed original ""master plan"" for Tesla. But by early 2023, Musk had agreed to move forward with the plan laid out by his lieutenants.

But now, things have changed. Reuters reports that work has stopped on the traditional car project in favor of the robotaxi approach. Despite the fact that Musk has agreed to move forward with the plan laid out by his lieutenants in 2023, things have changed, and the future of the project now hangs in the balance.

It also offers unique content that matches the page and provides specific details about the shift in Tesla's focus from low-cost EVs to robotaxis.","Affordable Tesla Model: Report Suggests Scrapped $25K EV Plans in Favor of Robotaxi (SEO Title)

Tesla has reportedly dropped its plan to build a $25,000 electric vehicle (EV) and will instead focus on its robotaxi project. The lower-cost EV had been in the works for several years, with CEO Elon Musk teasing the idea of an affordable Tesla as early as 2020. However, the company's focus has now shifted towards building a robotaxi using the same EV platform as the low-cost car.

The decision to scrap the $25,000 EV project comes after Musk expressed his preference for a clean robotaxi design, stating that the vehicle must be designed as a robotaxi and that it would ""transform everything."" Despite the initial pushback from engineers to include a steering wheel and pedals, the traditional car version was kept alive as a ""shadow project"" by lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy.

In early 2023, Musk agreed to move forward with the plan laid out by his lieutenants to build an inexpensive, small car as part of the company's growth strategy. However, recent reports suggest that work on the traditional car project has stopped in favor of the robotaxi approach.

The shift in focus raises questions about the future of the low-cost EV project and Tesla's commitment to producing an affordable electric vehicle. While the robotaxi project may offer new opportunities for the company, the decision to abandon the $25,000 EV project could disappoint those who were looking forward to a more accessible Tesla model.

Regardless of the reason behind the decision, the move highlights the complex and ever-evolving nature of the electric vehicle market. As the industry continues to grow and develop, companies like Tesla must constantly adapt and innovate to stay ahead of the competition and meet the changing needs of consumers.

In summary, Tesla has reportedly dropped its plans to build a $25,000 EV and will instead focus on its robotaxi project. The decision to scrap the low-cost EV project is a significant shift for the company and raises questions about its commitment to producing an affordable electric vehicle.

These vulnerabilities in AMD and Intel chips' confidential computing technologies, discovered by ETH Zurich researchers, leave companies and governments at risk of unauthorized data access. Hypervisor instability and interrupt mechanism exploitation can compromise data security, posing a significant threat to sensitive data processing.","Title: The Unmasking of Confidential Computing: A Deep Dive into Cloud Security

Introduction

In recent years, hardware manufacturers have made significant strides in developing confidential computing technologies. These technologies aim to provide a secure method for companies and governmental organizations to process sensitive data using shared cloud computing resources. Confidential computing isolates sensitive data during processing, making it inaccessible to other users and even the cloud provider. However, researchers from ETH Zurich have discovered vulnerabilities in this system, proving that hackers could potentially gain access to these supposedly secure systems.

The Research and Findings

The ETH Zurich team, led by Professor Shweta Shinde, discovered security gaps in the confidential computing technologies used in AMD and Intel processors. The team was investigating these processors as part of their work on an eavesdrop-proof smartphone based on confidential computing. The researchers focused on the trusted execution environment (TEE), a hardware-based component that isolates applications during processing. The TEE protects data from unauthorized access while it is being stored, unencrypted, in the working memory.

The team identified two main vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of confidential computing:

1. Hypervisor Instability: In a public cloud, applications are isolated using a TEE, which is managed by a hypervisor. Hypervisors are essential for cloud services as they manage resources, ensure security, and optimize the use of hardware components. However, the administrative functions performed by hypervisors can also open up a variety of attacks. Under certain conditions, these attacks can allow unauthorized access to data stored in the memories of other active cloud users.

2. Interrupt Mechanism Exploitation: The researchers found that hackers could exploit the interrupt mechanism, which temporarily disrupts regular processing, to gain access to the system. There are 256 different interrupts, and each one triggers a specific sequence of programming commands. By using what's known as the interrupt mechanism, hackers can disrupt the system and potentially access sensitive data.

The Implications

These vulnerabilities pose significant risks for companies and governmental organizations that process sensitive data. Unauthorized access to data in use is considered the most probable risk associated with using a public cloud, according to a report by the Swiss Federal Council. Although there are fundamental limitations to fully isolating and protecting a user system from the hypervisor,",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2020/computerchips.jpg,2024-04-04 17:06:03,"Discover cloud computing's hidden risks and how ETH Zurich's research urges a security overhaul.

Introduction

The landscape of mental health care is evolving, with technology playing an increasingly significant role in addressing gaps in accessibility, affordability, and effectiveness. Among the various digital tools available, prescription digital treatments hold the potential to revolutionize the way we manage mental health disorders. Recently, the FDA approved Rejoyn, a smartphone app designed to alleviate symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). This marks a significant milestone in digital mental health care, as Rejoyn is the first digital therapeutic for depression to receive clearance from the regulatory body.

Understanding Prescription Digital Therapeutics

Prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) are software-based treatments that address specific medical conditions, such as mental health disorders. These applications are designed to be used under the supervision of healthcare providers and are often prescribed alongside traditional treatments, like medication. Unlike widely available therapy and wellness apps, PDTs like Rejoyn undergo rigorous clinical trials to ensure safety, efficacy, and quality.

Rejoyn: The First FDA-Approved Digital Therapeutic for Depression

Rejoyn, developed by Click Therapeutics and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, received FDA approval on Monday as a supplemental treatment for adults aged 22 and older with MDD who are taking antidepressant medication. Unlike popular therapy apps such as BetterHelp and Talkspace, Rejoyn requires a prescription from a healthcare provider for access.

Rejoyn's Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT) is a six-week brain-training program designed by neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. EFMT taps into the brain's neuroplasticity, targeting neural areas affected by depression. By strengthening and balancing connections in the brain, Rejoyn aims to improve emotional processing and regulation.

Clinical Evidence and Efficacy

Rejoyn's FDA approval was based on a 13-week study involving 386 participants aged 22 to 64.

In the realm of robotics, air-ground robots hold immense potential for navigating complex outdoor environments and performing a myriad of tasks. From search and rescue missions to package delivery and environmental monitoring, these robots can significantly aid humans in overcoming challenges associated with inaccessible areas. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by occlusions that can lead to collisions and suboptimal pathways. A team of researchers from the University of Hong Kong has developed an innovative solution to tackle this issue: AGRNav, a novel framework designed to enhance the autonomous navigation of air-ground robots in occlusion-prone environments.

Previously, navigation systems have struggled with predicting occlusions, resulting in higher collision probabilities and energy-inefficient paths. AGRNav addresses this challenge by predicting occlusions in advance, thereby minimizing and avoiding collisions while optimizing energy consumption. The team's research, published on the arXiv preprint server, highlights the promising results achieved by AGRNav in both simulations and real-world experiments.

AGRNav comprises two primary components: a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) and a hierarchical path planner. The SCONet predicts the distribution of obstacles and their semantic features using a deep learning approach that requires minimal computational resources. The hierarchical path planner, on the other hand, utilizes these predictions to plan optimal, energy-efficient aerial and ground paths for the robot to reach a specified location.

The SCONet component captures contextual information and occlusion area features by employing a self-attention mechanism, enabling accurate obstacle predictions. The framework also features a query-based method for low-latency updates of prediction results to the grid map. Based on the updated map, the hierarchical path planner searches for energy-saving paths for efficient navigation.

To evaluate AGRNav's performance, the researchers tested it on a customized air-ground robot in both simulations and real-world environments. The results demonstrated that AGRNav outperformed all baseline and state-of-the-art robot navigation frameworks, identifying optimal and energy-efficient paths for the robot.

In Brief:

Tesla reduces Model Y prices by up to $7,000 to stimulate demand and tackle a 40,000-EV inventory buildup in the US. The price cuts follow a sales growth warning and high-interest-rate challenges.","Title: Tesla's Unprecedented Inventory Backlog: A Deep Dive

Introduction

Tesla, the trailblazing electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, is taking significant steps to address an unusual inventory buildup in the United States. The company is reducing the prices of unsold Model Y SUVs by thousands of dollars to stimulate demand and clear out the backlog. This article delves into the reasons behind this inventory buildup, Tesla's attempts to rectify the situation, and the potential implications for the EV market.

The Inventory Backlog and Price Adjustments

Tesla has slashed prices on various Model Y versions to entice buyers and reduce the inventory buildup. Long-range and performance Model Ys now sell for $5,000 less than their original price, while rear-wheel-drive versions have seen even steeper cuts of over $7,000. These reductions aim to attract customers and help the company manage its inventory more effectively.

The inventory glut stems from Tesla producing more vehicles than it sold in the first quarter of the year. Although some of the excess vehicles might have been in transit, the company still built 433,371 cars but shipped only 386,810. This disparity has led to a considerable inventory buildup, with Tesla adding more than 40,000 EVs to its inventory in just one quarter.

The Struggle to Boost Sales Growth

In 2023, Tesla warned that sales growth could be ""notably lower"" compared to previous years, a trend echoed across the industry. Established automakers like Ford and newcomers such as Lucid have experienced similar challenges in maintaining robust sales growth.

To counteract the slowdown, Tesla initiated a series of measures to boost sales, including increasing the price of the Model Y by $1,000 in April. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk mandated demos of the company's advanced driver assistance system for potential buyers, a move designed to enhance profitability per vehicle. Despite these efforts, Tesla has had to work harder to generate demand for its products.

The Role of High Interest Rates

Introduction

In the world of electric vehicles (EVs), Tesla has consistently been a trailblazer, pushing boundaries and daring to reimagine the future of transportation. Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that a ""Tesla Robotaxi"" would be unveiled on August 8, following a report by Reuters that the company was shifting its focus from a $25,000 low-cost EV to a robotaxi. This announcement comes at a critical time for Tesla, as EV sales have slowed, and profits have dipped. This article explores the background and potential impact of this new development in the EV industry.

The Shift in Focus

In early April 2024, Reuters published an article citing three anonymous sources and internal documents, stating that Tesla was abandoning its plans for a low-cost EV to concentrate on developing a robotaxi. Musk quickly took to his social media platform, X, to deny these claims, asserting that Reuters was ""lying."" However, he later announced that a ""Tesla Robotaxi"" would be unveiled on August 8, leaving many to wonder whether there was some truth to the original report.

For years, rumors have circulated that Tesla has been working on two vehicles: a traditional car and a robotaxi without a steering wheel or pedals. Musk has previously wavered between prioritizing a standard vehicle or one that fully embraces autonomous driving technology. Despite Musk's resistance, Tesla engineers and designers, including Franz von Holzhausen and Lars Moravy, continued to develop a more traditional car as a ""shadow project,"" according to Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk.

The Promise of Autonomous Capabilities

Musk has long promised autonomous capabilities for Tesla vehicles. In 2016, he declared that a Tesla would drive itself cross-country by the end of 2017, a goal that was not met. In 2019, Musk announced the launch of the company's first robotaxis and an autonomous ride-sharing network in 2020, a promise that also fell short.

A team of researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has recently developed a groundbreaking next-generation phase change memory (PCAM) device. This innovative development, published in the journal Nature, promises to address the existing challenges in the memory industry, such as high processing costs and substantial power consumption, by introducing an ultra-low power consumption PCAM device.

Traditional phase change memory devices have faced issues like expensive fabrication processes for creating highly scaled devices and the requirement of significant power for operation. To tackle these problems, the KAIST research team, led by Professor Shinhyun Choi, devised an ultra-low power phase change memory device by electrically forming an ultra-small nanometer (nm) scale phase changeable filament, eliminating the need for costly fabrication methods. This novel approach offers the dual benefits of reduced processing costs and ultra-low power consumption, making it an attractive alternative to existing DRAM and NAND flash memory solutions.

Memory technology has long been dominated by two primary types: DRAM and NAND flash memory. DRAM, renowned for its speed, exhibits volatile characteristics, meaning data disappears when power is turned off. NAND flash memory, a storage device, offers slower read/write speeds but compensates with non-volatile characteristics, allowing it to preserve data even when power is cut off. Phase change memory, however, combines the advantages of both DRAM and NAND flash memory, offering high speed and non-volatile characteristics. As a result, PCAM has gained attention as the next-generation memory that can potentially replace existing memory technologies and is being actively researched for its potential in neuromorphic computing, which mimics the human brain's functions.

Conventional phase change memory devices, however, consume a substantial amount of power during operation, making the production of large-capacity memory products and the realization of a neuromorphic computing system challenging. Past research efforts have attempted to improve thermal efficiency for memory device operation by reducing power consumption through the use of advanced lithography technologies to shrink the physical size of the device. However, these approaches have faced limitations in terms of practicality, as the improvement in power consumption has been minimal and has resulted in increased fabrication costs and complexity",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/researchers-develop-a-6.jpg,2024-04-04 10:04:57,"""Discover ultra-low power PCAM technology: A cost-effective, energy-efficient memory solution - Read more!"" {17 words}", Ultra-low power ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

In the digital age, online resources like Google Books and Google Scholar have become indispensable tools for students, researchers, and curious minds alike. These platforms enable users to access an extensive library of books and academic literature, promising a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips. However, recent developments reveal a troubling trend: the infiltration of low-quality, AI-generated content into these reputable databases.

A disturbing discovery by 404 Media unveiled the presence of AI-generated books, which appear to be written by human authors, on Google Books. By querying ChatGPT for current events, the researchers found that books containing verbatim instances of the phrase ""As of my last knowledge update"" had been indexed. This revelation sparked concerns about the authenticity and credibility of works found on the platform.

The proliferation of these AI-generated books is alarming, as they often lack depth and originality. A quick glance at the publications, which are mostly between 50 and 100 pages, reveals superficial narratives that resemble little more than glorified Wikipedia entries. The ""authors"" behind these works have managed to publish dozens of titles in 2023 alone, further fueling suspicions about their origins.

Moreover, these AI-generated books are not confined to Google Books. They have also infiltrated Google Scholar, a resource dedicated to academic literature. A simple search for ""As of my last knowledge update"" yields 19 pages of results, including papers on various topics such as at-risk youth, diabetes, autism, COVID-19, and airline pilot fatigue. This raises questions about the quality and reliability of information presented in such works.

The issue of AI-generated content spreading on the web is not a novel problem. However, its appearance alongside human-written work in reputable resources like Google Books and Google Scholar exacerbates the situation. The potential consequences of this infiltration include misinformation, plagiarism, and a deterioration of trust in online resources.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-competitiveness-emission-trucks.html,Study examines cost competitiveness of zero-emission trucks, Medium- and Heavy-Duty ZEVs: Cost Parity with Diesel by 2035 ,"Title: The Future of Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles: A Shift Towards Zero-Emission

Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) account for only 5% of the vehicles on the road in the United States, yet they contribute to 21% of transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As the world grapples with climate change and worsening air quality, it is crucial to reduce emissions from MHDVs. A promising solution lies in the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), such as battery electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).

A study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) explored the potential for ZEVs to reach total cost of driving (TCD) parity with diesel MHDVs by 2035 across all market segments. TCD parity occurs when the cost of owning and operating a ZEV is equal to or lower than that of a diesel vehicle. The study found that with continued improvements in vehicles and fuels, ZEVs could reach TCD parity or better compared to diesel vehicles by 2035 in all market segments.

The shift towards ZEVs is supported by various policies and initiatives, including increased air quality and GHG emissions standards, tax credits for ZEV purchases, and investments in research and development for ZEV technologies and infrastructure deployments. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for instance, includes tax credits of up to $40,000 for qualifying clean vehicle purchases, including EVs and FCEVs, as well as incentives for charging and refueling infrastructure.

NREL's Transportation Energy & Mobility Pathway Options (TEMPO) Model was used to estimate how the TCD of MHDVs could evolve under a range of scenarios comprising technology cost and progress, fuel costs, and policies.

In response to recent concerns about the impact of Snapchat's ""Solar System"" feature on teenagers' feelings of friendship and self-worth, the social media giant has made adjustments to the feature. The Solar System, which ranks a user's proximity to their Snapchat friends, has been criticized for contributing to anxiety and hurt feelings.

The Solar System ranks a user's friends based on their level of interaction, placing them in orbits ranging from Mercury (closest friends) to Uranus (less frequently contacted friends). While this may seem like a fun way to engage users, it can also lead to misunderstandings about the nature of friendships.

Snapchat acknowledged the concerns and announced that they would be turning the feature off by default for Snapchat+ subscribers. This decision comes after the company received feedback indicating that the Solar System could exacerbate the negative feelings that arise when one realizes they're not as close to a friend as they thought.

By turning off the feature by default, Snapchat hopes to strike a balance between providing a desired feature and avoiding unnecessary distress for users who do not wish to participate. However, it is worth noting that turning off the feature may not entirely eliminate the issue, as teens who are already invested in the system may simply search for the setting to turn it back on.

Snapchat noted that less than 0.25% of the community uses the Solar System option. However, considering that the feature is exclusively available to Snapchat+ subscribers, the percentage is not surprising. A more relevant statistic would be the number of Snapchat+ users who have engaged with the Solar System or viewed the feature.

A recent breakthrough in materials science has unveiled the previously overlooked role of substrates in information processing, a discovery that could lead to a new era of faster and more efficient electronics. This groundbreaking research, led by Penn State researchers and published in Advanced Materials, has revealed that the substrate material responds to electrical changes much like the semiconductor on top of it.

The researchers focused on vanadium dioxide (VO2), a promising material for semiconductor technology due to its low energy consumption and rapid switching capabilities between insulating and conducting states. Venkatraman Gopalan, the study's lead researcher, said, ""New ideas are needed for smaller and faster electronics in order to keep up with Moore's law. One idea being pursued is materials, such as vanadium dioxide, that can switch between metalâ€”the one stateâ€”and insulatorâ€”the zero stateâ€”states in a trillionth of a second.""

Vanadium dioxide has unique properties, including strongly correlated electronic effects, which can lead to novel functionalities such as high-temperature superconductivity and enhanced magnetic properties. However, the underlying physics of this material is not yet fully understood, and its performance in a device geometry is even lesser understood.

A team of international researchers decided to investigate vanadium dioxide in a device rather than isolation, applying a voltage to make it switch from an insulating to a conducting state. They used the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory, which utilizes powerful X-ray beams to study the behavior and structure of materials on the atomic level.

When mapping the spatial and temporal response of the material to the switching event, the researchers observed unexpected changes to the structure of the material and substrate. The VO2 film bulged as it changed to a metal, a surprising observation considering it was supposed to shrink. The APS X-ray also revealed that the titanium dioxide (TiO2) substrate, which was grown on and normally considered an electrically and mechanically passive material, was active and responded in unexpected ways as the film switched from insulator to metal and back when the electrical pulses arrived",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/surprising-hidden-acti-1.jpg,2024-04-04 10:52:05,"Meta Description:

Introduction

The Gulf Coast of the United States is no stranger to tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. These phenomena can cause widespread electricity outages, a problem that is expected to worsen due to climate change and global warming. A recent study by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany aimed to investigate the impact of extreme weather events on the Texas power grid. The study, published in Nature Energy, identifies critical lines that should be strengthened to prevent serious outages in the future.

The Impact of Extreme Weather Events on the Texas Power Grid

Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and severe tropical cyclones, often cause significant damage to transmission lines and towers. This damage can lead to further system and infrastructure failures, resulting in widespread blackouts and power outages. The researchers focused on extreme wind events, which have a significant impact on transmission lines and towers.

The study found that every time a transmission line fails, the topology and dynamics of a power grid change. This means that the grid's response to future adverse weather events and associated damage will depend on the history of previous damages and how they functioned after these damages. The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding the interplay between evolving storm conditions and the partially destroyed state of the grid.

Are we at AGI yet?

Defining AGI remains elusive, making it difficult to pinpoint when a company or research group achieves it. According to pioneering AI scientist Geoffrey Hinton, systems like GPT-4 or Google's Gemini were once considered AGI-level. However, recent advancements have raised expectations, requiring AGI to excel in a wide range of tasks and exhibit human-like adaptability.

Segmenting AGI progress into levels or creating a consensus on measurement is among the approaches researchers are considering. OpenAI and others continue refining their methods in this quest for AGI, balancing progress with the ethical and societal implications of such transformative technology.","Title: The Pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence: A New Frontier in AI Research

Introduction

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), also known as ""strong AI,"" is a rapidly growing area of research that aims to create machines as broadly smart as humans or capable of performing a diverse range of tasks as well as people can. This concept has become a driving force for companies like OpenAI, as well as the research wings of tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. However, the path to achieving AGI is not without challenges and concerns. This article will delve into the definition, current state, and potential implications of AGI.

What is AGI?

AGI is not to be confused with generative AI, which focuses on AI systems that generate new documents, images, and sounds. Instead, AGI is a more abstract concept that refers to AI systems that are at least as good as humans at nearly all cognitive tasks. According to Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist, AGIs are systems that are better than humans at various cognitive tasks, which he refers to as ""superintelligence.""

AGI is a term that harks back to the original vision of artificial intelligence held by mid-20th century computer scientists. Before AI research branched into specialized and commercially viable subfields, such as face recognition and speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, the goal was to build a thinking machine. The term AGI was coined to signal a return to this ambitious vision.

Are we at AGI yet?

With no clear definition of AGI, it is challenging to determine when a company or group of researchers will have achieved it. According to Hinton, twenty years ago, systems with the ability of GPT-4 or Google's Gemini would have been considered to have achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans. However, with the recent advancements in AI, the goalposts have shifted, and people now expect AGI to perform just as well as humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning, and the ability to learn from experiences.
