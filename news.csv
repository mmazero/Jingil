In recent developments, some Threads users may have noticed a change in their messaging capabilities. According to a report by Engadget, a select group of individuals now possess the ability to directly message others through Threads – but only if those recipients also use Instagram. Previously, Threads had relied on its connection with Instagram for various functionalities; however, this latest update takes things a step further.

When asked about the new feature, a Meta representative clarified that this was merely an expansion of existing cross-platform sharing abilities. Essentially, the modification allows selected Threads users to transmit messages to specific individuals on Instagram. However, contrary to popular belief, this does not signify the arrival of Direct Messages (DMs) within the Threads application itself. Rather, it aims to streamline communication by eliminating the necessity to toggle between applications when initiating contact.

This enhancement arises due to the absence of a standalone messaging inbox within Threads—a challenge initially acknowledged by Instagram Head Adam Mosseri back in November 2023. At the time, he expressed concerns over whether integrating the Instagram inbox into Threads would create confusion regarding notification management. Alternatively, developing a distinct Threads inbox could result in duplicate conversations across two separate apps. Neither solution seemed ideal.

Despite these improvements, several limitations remain associated with the updated messaging feature. Most notably, Meta assumes that users maintain similar friendships and interactions on both Threads and Instagram. Consequently, delivering a message through Instagram instead of Threads could potentially bewilder recipients. Furthermore, accessing and responding to such missives requires navigating to the Instagram platform. Lastly, while Instagram's current DM system serves its primary purpose well, it doesn't offer optimal performance as a universal messaging service catering to multiple applications simultaneously.

Nonetheless, the integration demonstrates progress towards enhancing interconnectivity between Meta-owned platforms. As updates continue to roll out, we anticipate witnessing improved user experiences tailored specifically for Threads enthusiasts seeking seamless interaction across social media channels.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d273598145570b7d2074dbe4cba1cc2577f0c264/2024/04/15/c35314d6-755f-4dc3-8cb5-7ce40d18a829/figure-top-threads-testing-direct-messages-but-theres-a-twist.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-15 00:00:00,"""Discover cross-platform messaging on Threads!

Recently, PVML secured an $8 million seed round led by reputable investors such as NFX, FJ Labs, and Gefen Capital. Let's delve deeper into the story behind PVML and its innovative approach to data privacy and accessibility.

Founders & Background

PVML was established by a dynamic duo—Shachar Schnapp (CEO) and Rina Galperin (CTO)—who met during their academic pursuits. Both possess impressive credentials in fields related to AI and data privacy; Schnapp obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science, focusing on differential privacy, and later applied his skills at General Motors' computer vision department. Meanwhile, Galperin earned her Master's Degree in Computer Science, concentrating on AI and Natural Language Processing, before working on machine learning projects at Microsoft. Their extensive professional backgrounds set the stage for developing advanced techniques to address prevalent challenges faced by businesses handling vast amounts of data.

Democratising Data through Differential Privacy

With years of industry experience under their belts, the founders recognized the need for improved efficiency in managing sensitive corporate data. They identified ""data democratisation"" as the key objective, aiming to strike a balance between safeguarding confidentiality and ensuring straightforward access for AI applications. According to Galperin, ""Our primary goal is to enable organisations to efficiently utilise their sensitive data while protecting user privacy.""

Understanding Differential Privacy

Differential privacy isn't a novel concept per se, having first emerged over a decade ago. Its fundamental principle revolves around preserving individuals' privacy in extensive datasets, backed by robust mathematical assurances. To attain these guarantees, researchers typically incorporate controlled noise into the dataset, carefully calibrated so as not to distort analytical outcomes.

Existing Solutions vs PVML's Approach

Traditional methods employed to grant secure data access tend to generate significant overhead costs, ultimately hindering productivity. Commonly, substantial portions of data must be excised to accommodate employee access, impairing subsequent analyses due to reduced sample sizes. Moreover, extended wait times render real-time use cases virtually untenable. By harnessing differential privacy, PVML ensures that users never need to modify original data, thereby circumventing unnecessary overhead expenses and facilitating safe AI usage.

From Theory to Practice

Although many prominent tech firms employ differential privacy in various capacities, widespread adoption remains elusive among the broader data community. As Schnapp explains, ""Current understanding of differential privacy largely resides in the theoretical realm, rather than being practically applicable. Our mission entails bridging this gap, transforming abstract concepts into tangible solutions tailored to real-world situations."" Consequently, PVML focuses on devising practicable algorithms optimized for diverse use cases across industries.

Empowering Seamless Interactions with Data

At the heart of PVML's innovation lies its capacity to facilitate conversational interactions with data via RAG technology while upholding stringent privacy standards.

[Turkish] Meta'da TC Üyesi yetkililerinden yönlendirilen karar doğrultusunda, Türkiye'deki kullanıcılar için Threads hizmetini sonlandıracak. Bu, TCA tarafından ilan edilen geçici bir karara yani bir gecici muvaveret nedeniyle gerçekleşecektir. Karar, Meta, Kullanıcıların Instagram hesabına bağlanmış olan Threads profillerinde bulunan verilere erişme ve bu verileri paylaşma seçeneğine izin vermeden bu iki platform arasındaki veri birleştirmede yasadıkları monopoli kullanımı konusundaki sorunları ortadan kaldırmaya zorladığı için getirdiği iddianame üzerine alınmıştır.

[Translation] According to a decision made by a member of the Turkish Competition Board, Meta will cease providing the Threads service to users in Turkey due to a preliminary injunction issued by the TCA. This decision comes after the TCA announced concerns regarding Meta's practice of merging data between Threads and Instagram without allowing users to opt in to connect their respective accounts.

Cleaned & Rewritten Text:

On Monday, Meta revealed plans to ""temporarily"" discontinue its Threads app in Turkey starting from April 29th. This move follows a preliminary injunction ordered by the Turkish Competition Authority (RK) concerning how Meta handles user data sharing between Threads and Instagram.

Previously, the RK highlighted that Meta's actions involved abusing its dominance in the market through combining user data from both platforms without explicit consent from users. This revelation prompted the regulator to impose an €18.6 million penalty ($18.6 million USD) against Meta in 2022. Furthermore, the watchdog threatened daily fines amounting to $160,000 due to Meta's failure to comply with the initial ruling earlier this year.

Instagram, one of Meta's subsidiaries, released Threads during the summer of 2021, aiming to benefit from the mass migration of Twitter users caused by Elon Musk's acquisition. Despite attracting around 130 million users, Meta's handling of user signups drew persistent criticisms. Initially, removing a Threads profile required deletion of the entire Instagram account; however, Meta eventually provided a standalone option for abandoning just the Threads profile. When first introducing the platform in the EU, Meta complied with regional laws by delaying the release and implementing a 'View Without Profile' feature, enabling users to explore the social media site while avoiding full registration.

As early as December, Turkish authorities commenced probing whether Meta connected Threads and Instagram appropriately. Following their investigation, the TCA determined that Meta violated various rules governing markets and consumer rights. Their provisional report outlined several critical factors contributing to Meta's influential standing in the industry:

 Meta's extensive and diverse pool of user data enhances ad attraction.
 Advertisement revenues enable Meta to devote greater resources toward developing existing services.
 Meta's multi-service offerings strengthen its competitive advantage.
 Cross-platform interaction bolsters Meta's market power.

Accordingly, Meta agreed to suspend the availability of Threads in Turkey until further negotiations and resolution efforts occur. As stated in their official blog post, Meta contests the temporary ban despite believing itself fully compliant with local legal stipulations. They intend to challenge the ruling and expressed hopes to restore Threads in Turkey soonest possible.

Users currently utilizing Threads in Turkey will receive notifications about the forthcoming suspension beforehand, receiving two choices—permanently deleting or merely deactivating their profile. Choosing the latter permits them to reinstate their presence once the application becomes accessible in the nation again.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1978497338-e1713180431349.jpg?resize=1200,676",2024-04-15 12:18:45,"Meta to Temporarily Discontinue Threads in Turkey Over Data Sharing Concerns

At the heart of our story are two emulators: iGBA and Delta. Both cater to fans of Nintendo's iconic handheld devices, enabling them to relive cherished gaming moments. Yet, only one garnered Apple's approval before abruptly disappearing from the App Store.

Over the weekend, iGBA emerged as a new addition to the App Store following Apple's relaxation of rules around retro game emulators. Interestingly, this happened shortly after European Union regulators compelled Apple to open up to competing app stores like AltStore, which provides access to various emulators and Patreon-backed apps for iPhone users.

Meanwhile, Delta, developed by renowned programmer Riley Testut, awaited release via Apple's TestFlight platform since early March. Frustrated by iGBA's sudden appearance and alleged infringement upon his work, Testut expressed his displeasure on social media platform Threads. His anger stemmed not just from Apple's premature approval of an unauthorized clone, but also from seeing his creation monetized without consent.

A Closer Look: Copyright Concerns and Developer Disputes

While iGBA functioned similarly to GBA4iOS (its open-source predecessor), it lacked necessary permissions for distribution. Testut didn't grant any party authority to utilize or distribute his creations, making iGBA's launch all the more problematic.

Some observers noticed striking similarities between iGBA and GBA4iOS codes, sparking debates over whether the former constituted copyright infringement. Although GBA4iOS operated under GNU GPL v2 license (permitting copies), Testut added a unique stipulation barring App Store distribution for works containing his code. Thus, even though GPLv2 generally allows duplication, this particular situation seemed to breach Apple's guidelines concerning spam and copyright.

Resolution and Lessons Learned

After investigating the issue, Apple decided to eliminate iGBA for violating its App Store regulations around spam and copyright infringement. Despite initially greenlighting the app, the tech titan eventually sided with Testut, emphasizing the importance of respecting developers' intellectual properties.

According to Nick Clegg, Meta's President of Global Affairs, the upcoming education product will feature a dedicated hub for educational applications and tools, enabling simultaneous management of multiple devices without individual updates. This development promises more diversified content for Quest users and encourages developers to create tailored solutions for the platform. While a 'killer app' might still be absent from VR, increased activity in the sector is anticipated.

Concerns and Controversies

Despite Meta's efforts to expand its reach in education, recent events raise questions regarding user privacy and safety. Lowering the minimum age requirement for WhatsApp users in certain regions, coupled with Meta requesting confirmation of ages for existing Quest users, raises concerns about protecting vulnerable individuals. Addressing these matters adequately is crucial before fully embracing VR technology in educational settings.

Availability and Market Penetration

Initially targeting institutions with students aged 13 and above, Meta plans to debut the product in 20 countries where Quest for Business is currently supported. These markets mainly consist of English-speaking nations and select European and Asian territories. According to estimates by providers such as ClassVR, tens of thousands of classrooms worldwide utilize VR technology, signaling growing interest in immersive learning experiences. Nevertheless, implementing VR in mainstream education presents obstacles related to costs, health concerns, and ensuring effective instructional methods.

Competition in Educational VR

As Meta steps into the educational VR space, various competitors have already established themselves, including Immersion VR, ClassVR, and ArborXR. Moreover, Microsoft promotes its HoloLens as a valuable educational tool. Despite limited data on VR adoption rates across schools globally, demand appears to be increasing gradually. Providers like ClassVR claim 40,000 classrooms worldwide employ their products; however, significant barriers persist, particularly relating to integration into traditional school environments.

Health Concerns and Cost Considerations

One major concern surrounding widespread VR implementation in education involves extended exposure to screens and possible negative consequences associated with headgear use among children. Additionally, the expense of purchasing headsets, acquiring compatible software, and maintaining relevant infrastructure poses financial difficulties for many institutions. To overcome these limitations, Meta must address affordability, longevity, and overall value proposition when promoting its educational initiatives.

Final Thoughts

While Meta's venture into educational VR holds promise for expanding Quest's utility and fostering creativity among developers, addressing pressing controversies, user protection, and practical concerns remains vital. By doing so, Meta can contribute positively to shaping tomorrow's digitally enhanced learning landscapes while solidifying its presence as a responsible player in the industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fitness-Wellness-Use-Case_3.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-15 19:40:15,"Meta Description: Discover Meta's new education product for Quest Headsets, offering a dedicated hub for managing devices and diverse content.

Introduction

Renowned entrepreneur Elon Musk recently announced that new users on the popular social networking platform, X, may soon need to pay a small fee to enable posting. According to Musk, this move seeks to address the persistent issue of automated bots and improve user experience. In this article, we delve deeper into Musk's proposal and explore how it aligns with X's ongoing efforts to maintain a secure and authentic environment for its users.

Addressing the Bot Problem

The rapid growth of social networks has also led to increased instances of spamming through automated bots. These bots often create fake accounts, engage in unwanted interactions, disseminate misinformation, and disrupt online communities. Recognizing these challenges, Musk proposed a solution by introducing a minimal charge for new users looking to gain write access on the platform. He stated, ""a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots."" By doing so, he hopes to minimize the impact caused by such fraudulent activities while enhancing overall community engagement.

Musk further clarified that the fee would not affect existing users and that new accounts could still post after three months without making a payment. Though precise details regarding the implementation timeline and pricing structure remain undisclosed, this approach represents a promising step towards addressing one of the most pressing concerns affecting social platforms today.

X's Previous Efforts Against Manipulative Accounts

This announcement comes shortly after X initiated a substantial crackdown on spam accounts earlier this month. Warning users of possible fluctuations in their follower counts, the platform vowed to eradicate profiles that breached its guidelines concerning platform manipulation and spam. Although essential for maintaining security standards, mass removal campaigns sometimes result in the accidental deletion of legitimate accounts. Consequently, implementing a small fee for new users allows X to adopt a complementary methodology aimed at reducing the prevalence of malicious actors and promoting genuine interaction between members.

Monetization and User Engagement

Alongside combating bots, X has been exploring alternative revenue streams beyond traditional advertising models. Earlier last year, the platform introduced a subscription model requiring unverified users in certain countries to pay annual fees ranging from $1 to $10 based on their location. Additionally, premium features were rolled out for paid subscribers, offering enhanced functionality and exclusive benefits compared to regular users. With Musk's recent announcement, it appears likely that the social network intends to expand upon these monetization strategies as part of broader user engagement initiatives.

xAI Collaboration and AI Training

Furthermore, X's collaboration with Musk's AI firm, xAI, presents unique opportunities for integrating advanced technologies within the platform. Notably, X updated its policies in late 2023 to allow using public posts for training machine learning algorithms or AI models. Meanwhile, xAI began testing its conversational agent, Grok, which became accessible to all Premium users earlier this month. Based on reports indicating upcoming integration of Grok for composing posts, it seems plausible that X continues to seek innovative ways to blend human creativity with AI capabilities, ultimately fostering an even richer ecosystem of digital exchange.

Conclusion

With increasing concerns surrounding automation and disinformation campaigns, Elon Musk's decision to introduce charges for new users on X reflects a growing trend among social networks seeking sustainable solutions to combat these threats effectively. Implemented thoughtfully, such measures can help preserve trust and credibility while enabling meaningful connections across vast global communities. We look forward to witnessing how these developments unfold and anticipate exciting advancements in store for both X and its ever-growing user base.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-15 18:48:56,"Meta Description:

This revised SEO title includes the main points of the article, such as the departure of two top Tesla executives and the company-wide layoffs affecting 10% of the workforce. It is concise, informative, and remains under 50 characters.","Title: Top Tesla Executives Depart Amid Company-Wide Restructuring and Slowed Sales

Two of Tesla's high-profile executives, Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel, have recently left the electric automaker, TechCrunch confirmed. Their departures come as Tesla undergoes a significant restructuring process, which includes layoffs of thousands of employees to reduce costs and enhance productivity.

Drew Baglino, formerly Tesla's Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, Vice President of Public Policy and Business Development, have both left the company. Patel informed TechCrunch that his decision to depart was due to the ""big overall changes"" at Tesla, which he did not specify. Baglino mentioned in a X post that it was a ""difficult decision"" to leave after working at Tesla for 18 years. Tesla CEO Elon Musk thanked both of them for their contributions on his social media platform.

Tesla announced that it would reduce its global workforce by more than 10%, implying that over 14,000 employees could be affected, given the company's 140,000 employees at the end of 2023. This decision follows a year-over-year drop in sales and a cooling demand for electric vehicles (EVs). Musk emphasized the need to review the organization for cost reductions and productivity enhancement, as the company's growth has caused role duplication.

Baglino's departure is the second high-level executive exit in the past year, following Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn's resignation in August 2023. Baglino played an essential role in overseeing engineering for the company's powertrain and battery technologies and was one of the more responsive executives on Musk's social media platform. Patel, who served as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and an advisor on climate and energy, had also actively engaged with Tesla customers and fans recently.

In 2023, Tesla shipped a record 1.8 million EVs but spent the year reducing prices on its popular models to counteract high-interest rates and increased global competition.
