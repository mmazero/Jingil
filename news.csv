https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork"," AWS, Google, and Oracle Back Open-Source Redis Fork ","In recent news, the Linux Foundation announced its plans to host Valkey, a fork of the Redis in-memory data store. This move comes after Redis Labs, the commercial arm of Redis, switched from the permissive 3-clause BSD license to the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL) on March 20. While Redis Labs CEO Rowan Trollope said that he wouldn't be surprised if Amazon sponsored a fork, this is the first time that AWS and Google Cloud have backed an open-source fork together.

Redis is one of the most popular data stores and at the core of many large commercial and open-source deployments. Its history has been marked by a few licensing disputes, including when Redis founder Salvatore Sanfilippo launched the project under the BSD license in 2009. After Redis quickly gained popularity, Garantia became the first major Redis service provider, but Sanfilippo and the community pushed back. After some time, Garantia eventually changed its name to Redis Labs and then, in 2021, to Redis.

Sanfilippo joined Redis Labs in 2015 and later transferred his IP to Redis Labs/Redis, before stepping down from the company in 2020. That was a couple of years after Redis changed how it licenses its Redis Modules, which include visualization tools, a client SDK and more. For those modules, Redis first went with the Apache License with the added Commons Clause that restricts others from selling and hosting these modules. At the time, Redis said that despite this change for the modules, “the license for open-source Redis was never changed. It is BSD and will always remain BSD.”

However, a few weeks ago, Trollope reiterated that the large cloud vendors profited from the open-source version and are free to enter a commercial agreement with Redis. He emphasized that Valkey, the new fork, originated at AWS, where longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson initially started the project in her own GitHub account. When the news broke, a lot of the current Redis maintainers quickly decided to move on and signed on to what is now Valkey.

The original Redis private channel included five maintainers: three from Redis, Olson and Alibaba’s Zhao Zhao, as well as a small group of committers who also immediately signed on to what is now Valkey. The maintainers from Redis unsurprisingly did not sign on, but as David Nally, AWS’s director for open-source strategy and marketing, told me, the Valkey community would welcome them with open arms.

The fork was backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap. While AWS and Google Cloud rarely back an open-source fork together, this move shows that they are willing to work together to support open-source projects and create a more inclusive community.

In conclusion, the announcement of Valkey, a fork of Redis, is a significant move in the open-source community. While Redis Labs’ decision to switch to the SSPL may have been a contributing factor, the large cloud vendors’ backing of the project shows that they are committed to supporting open-source projects and creating a more inclusive community. As the world continues to transition towards open-source software, it is important to ensure that these projects remain accessible and inclusive for all.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"""Open-source Redis fork announced by AWS, Google Cloud, and other major players: Learn more about Valkey and its implications for the open-source community.""",Keyphrase: Open-source Redis fork,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-fabricating-high-density-vertical.html,A new strategy for fabricating high-density vertical organic electrochemical transistor arrays, High-density OECTs: New study in Nature Electronics,"Title: High-Density and Mechanically Flexible OECTs: A Review of a Recent Study in Nature Electronics

Introduction

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of transistors based on organic superconducting materials known for their ability to modulate electrical current in response to small changes in the voltage applied to their gate electrode. These transistors could be promising for the development of various brain-inspired and wearable technologies. However, most conventional OECTs developed so far have been found to exhibit various limitations, including limited stability and slow redox processes, which can significantly impair their performance.

Body

Recently, researchers at Northwestern University outlined a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs. Their proposed approach, outlined in a paper in Nature Electronics, was used to create various electronic components based on OECT arrays and circuits. The researchers aimed to address the limitations of conventional OECTs by utilizing electron-beam exposure (eBL) to micropattern organic semiconductors without employing masks or chemical solvents that could damage the materials.

The researchers exposed both p- and n-channel organic semiconductor films to a direct beam of electrons using eBL. This process allowed them to produce a pattern on the semiconducting films without damaging the materials. The patterned films resulting from this process were ultra-small and high-density while also presenting well-defined, conducting channel regions. Moreover, the eBL strategy employed by the researchers enabled the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits.

To further demonstrate the potential of their fabrication strategy, the researchers successfully used it to create various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. The circuits they created were found to perform remarkably well while also maintaining excellent operational stability.

The researchers' study highlights the potential of eBL for the scalable fabrication of OECTs, contributing to their integration into electronic devices. The fabrication process also enables the creation of high-density, mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits, which could be used for various applications, such as biosensors, wearable devices, and neuromorphic systems.

Conclusion

The recent study by Kim, Pankow, and their colleagues showcases the potential of eBL for the fabrication of high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs. The researchers successfully demonstrated the versatility of their approach by creating various electronic components based on OECT arrays and circuits. The study highlights the potential of OECTs for various applications and could inform the development of similar approaches to boost the stability and performance of OECT circuits.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/high-density-vertical.jpg,2024-03-31 09:00:01,"Meta Description: Fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs using e-beam exposure in an eco-friendly process.

Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility, the premier source for transportation news, insights, and analysis. In this edition, we'll dive into the latest developments in the world of EV startups, including Fisker's production pause, Arrival's asset sale, and Lucid's $1 billion boost. We'll also take a closer look at some exciting new startups working on improving EV range and increasing sustainability.

Fisker's Struggles:

Fisker, the electric vehicle startup that was once hailed as a game-changer in the EV industry, has been hit with a series of setbacks in recent months. In March, the company announced it was pausing production for six weeks and had only $121 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $32 million restricted or not immediately accessible. This came after negotiations with a potential partner fell apart, putting a convertible note deal in jeopardy. Shares plummeted 28%, trading was halted, and the New York Stock Exchange took steps to remove Fisker from its exchange.

Embarrassing Mishap:

To make matters worse, an internal audit conducted at Fisker revealed that the company temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries. This news has put a damper on the company's reputation and raised questions about its ability to continue operations.

Other EV Startups:

Despite the struggles of Fisker and other EV startups, there are still plenty of exciting developments in the industry. One such startup is Arrival, which recently sold some of its assets to Canoo, another struggling EV startup. While this news may be a blow for Arrival, it could be a positive sign for the industry as a whole.

Another promising startup is Ionobell, which claims to have developed a silicon material that will be cheaper and more effective than the established competition. This could help boost the range of EV batteries and make them more accessible to consumers.

Lucid's Big Boost:

Finally, we have some good news for Lucid, another EV startup that has faced its fair share of challenges. In April, the company announced it had raised another $1 billion from its biggest financial backer, Saudi Arabia. This investment will give Lucid an","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-collapse-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-31 19:00:27,"""Learn More"" button to the end of the meta description.", FSD ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/the-market-is-forcing-cloud-vendors-to-relax-data-egress-fees/,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees, Big Cloud Vendors Relax Data Egress Fees Amid Regulatory Pressure ,"Title: The Easing of Egress Fees by Cloud Vendors: A Sign of the Times

Are you a cloud-based company struggling with egress fees imposed by your cloud provider? You're not alone. In recent months, the big three cloud vendors — Amazon, Microsoft, and Google — have relaxed their egress fees, which are essentially a tax on customers looking to move their data to another cloud provider. As a result of this change, we can expect a new era of cloud computing that places more emphasis on customer satisfaction and innovation.

The reality of a multi-cloud world, stricter regulatory environments, and consumer backlash have all played a role in this shift. Cloud providers are finally realizing that charging egress fees can be counterproductive, and that true competition in the cloud market requires a more customer-centric approach. As John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director at Synergy Research, explains, ""Giving customers what they want is just the right business strategy. In the IT world of the last few years, legacy companies that have tried to hang on to the old ways of doing things have not done well.""

The emergence of multi-cloud environments has also made it increasingly difficult for companies to maintain a single cloud provider. Companies now require more flexibility and less friction when moving data between clouds. Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder of Bobsled, a startup that helps customers move data between clouds, has been on the front lines of this issue. ""The original cloud world, the three major cloud vendors were really fighting to try to build what felt like walled gardens, and as long as you built on top of them, everything was great. But going across them was really challenging,"" he says.

Now, egress fees are being phased out, and customers are looking for innovative and accessible features to retain them. As David Linthicum, a longtime cloud consultant, cautions, ""While these recent announcements are a pleasant PR move, it's important to review your bills carefully because egress fees aren't the only problem. Customers have to consider the costs holistically.""

It's important to note that this shift is not limited to cloud providers alone. Regulatory pressure has also played a significant role in this change. As Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, explains, ""The shift is partly due to regulatory pressure,","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738",2024-03-31 16:00:41,"Meta Description: ""In recent months, the big three cloud vendors - Amazon, Microsoft, and Google - have relaxed their egress fees, which are essentially a tax on customers looking to move their data to another cloud provider.

6G mobile vision services are set to transform the way we live, work, and play, with the use of innovative technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and autonomous driving. These services will enable us to capture and analyze videos and images in real-time, making them ideal for various applications, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, this requires high-performance processors (GPUs) and accurate learning models, which can be challenging to optimize.

Professor Jeongho Kwak, from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST, has developed a learning model and resource optimization technology that combines accuracy and efficiency for 6G vision services. This technology is expected to revolutionize the development of mobile vision services, including AR and autonomous driving.

Currently, learning models and computing/networking resources are treated as separate entities, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal performance. Professor Kwak's team focused on simultaneously optimizing learning models and computing/networking resources in real-time. As a result, they proposed a new integrated learning model and computing/networking optimization algorithm, VisionScaling, which is capable of reducing energy consumption by at least 30% while maintaining average accuracy compared to current technologies without compromising on average target accuracy or time delay.

The VisionScaling algorithm developed by Professor Kwak's team uses the latest learning technique, Online Convex Optimization (OCO), to adapt to constantly changing mobile environments, ensuring optimal performance in irregularly changing environments.

Furthermore, Professor Kwak's team implemented and tested the real-world mobile vision service environment using embedded AI devices and connected edge computing platforms. Their results confirmed that the developed VisionScaling algorithm saves 30% more energy in mobile devices and improves end-to-end latency by 39% compared to previously used algorithms.

Professor Kwak stated, ""This research satisfies both the practical contribution of implementing and verifying performance in irregularly changing mobile environments and the mathematical contribution of utilizing dynamic optimization and learning techniques to prove optimal performance. It is significant as it provides a technical foundation for deep learning-based mobile services requiring higher memory/computing resources in the future.""
