Mahbod Moghadam, an intriguing and multifaceted figure in the startup world, passed away last month at the age of 41 due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. Moghadam was known for his involvement in various ventures, including Genius, Everipedia, and HellaDoge, as well as his work as an angel investor.

The tech community recently learned of his passing, with numerous tributes pouring in on social media platforms. Josh Constine, a former TechCrunch writer and current investor, shared his memories of Moghadam, describing him as ""a complex, edgy, and at times problematic guy, but also genuinely funny, brilliant, and always unique.""

In his most recent years, Moghadam had been living in Los Angeles, focusing on developing ways to help creators receive fair compensation for their work. One of his recent projects was HellaDoge, a short-lived social media platform that rewarded users with dogecoin for contributing dogecoin-related content. The platform aimed to create a more direct and equitable system for content creators, unlike traditional ad-based platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

Moghadam's interest in creators' rights and fair compensation can be traced back to 2009. After graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, he became a lawyer just as the economy was collapsing. When he was let go from his law firm, Moghadam used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius (later renamed Genius) with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman.

Genius began as a platform for users to annotate and analyze hip-hop lyrics, eventually expanding to include annotations for various types of content. The platform gained significant traction, with rappers such as Nas joining as advisors and investors. However, Moghadam's tenure at Genius was marked by controversial behavior, which ultimately led to his resignation in 2014.

After leaving Genius, Moghadam co-founded Everipedia, a decentralized, blockchain-based encyclopedia that was later",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8698091273_475f659390_b.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-07 01:51:05,"Witness the life and legacy of tech visionary Mahbod Moghadam.

On August 8, 2024, Tesla is set to unveil its much-awaited robotaxi, as announced by CEO Elon Musk on his X account. This announcement comes at a time when self-driving vehicles are encountering speed bumps due to safety concerns, creating an air of anticipation and excitement in the industry.

Musk's announcement caused Tesla's shares to rise by over 3% in after-market trades, following a day of decline. The enigmatic billionaire has consistently touted Tesla's advancements in autonomous driving technology. He proclaimed in a post on X that Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities would soon become ""superhuman,"" rendering human-driven cars seemingly archaic.

Moreover, Musk has suggested that Tesla owners with FSD-enabled vehicles could soon transform their cars into robotaxis, making the most of their investment even when their cars are not in use. Despite the promise of self-driving vehicles, the United States has experienced a cautious and bumpy rollout due to safety apprehensions from both regulators and the public.

Cities like San Francisco have become testing grounds for this technology, with robotaxis from Google's Waymo encountering vandalism from opponents of autonomous vehicles. General Motors-owned Cruise was compelled to suspend its robotaxi service indefinitely following several accidents and mounting regulatory pressure in California.

Tesla's autopilot feature has also received its fair share of criticism, with allegations that the marketing of the feature overstated its actual capabilities. The robotaxi reveal came on the heels of a Reuters report stating that Tesla had abandoned Musk's ambitious plan to manufacture an electric car model priced near $25,000 to drive mass-market adoption. Musk swiftly dismissed the report on his X account.

In the first quarter of this year, Tesla reported a sharp decrease in auto sales, owing to unremarkable demand for electric vehicles and increased competition. The company's global deliveries fell by 8.5%, with weaker sales in China being a significant factor.

Introduction

The idea of remotely operating robots, also known as teleoperation, has the potential to revolutionize the way we perform various tasks. This technology could enable humans to carry out risky and complex procedures from a safe distance. Moreover, it could be used to collect datasets of human motions, which could help train humanoid robots for new tasks.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have recently developed Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), a method for effectively teleoperating human-sized humanoid robots. This approach, presented in a paper on the arXiv preprint server, offers the opportunity to train humanoid robots in manual tasks requiring specific sets of movements, such as playing sports, pushing carts or strollers, and moving boxes.

The H 2 O System: A Scalable and Efficient Solution

The H 2 O system facilitates real-time teleoperation of full-sized humanoid robots, setting it apart from many other methods. Contrary to these approaches, H 2 O relies only on an RGB camera, making it easier to scale up and widely adopt.

Tairan He, a co-author of the paper, emphasized the importance of human teleoperation in collecting data for humanoid robots and the necessity of making it accessible and user-friendly. Inspired by previous works addressing various aspects of this challenge, such as physics-based animation of human motions, transferring human motions to real-world humanoids, and teleoperating humanoids, the study aims to combine these components into a single framework.

H 2 O: A Reinforcement Learning-based Framework

H 2 O teleoperation is a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables real-time whole-body teleoperation of humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. The process begins with retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities through a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints. The refined motion dataset then trains an RL-based motion imitator in simulation, which is subsequently transferred to the real robot without further adjustment.

This week, we delve into the changing landscape of fintech representation in Y Combinator's cohorts, the decline in fintech funding, and a notable development in the world of green banking.

The Shrinking Fintech Representation in Y Combinator

Y Combinator's Winter 2024 cohort saw a significant decrease in fintech participation. Out of the 260 companies, only 8% were classified as fintech, compared to 10% in the summer of 2023, 21% in the summer of 2022, and 24% in the winter of 2022. This shrinkage indicates a potential shift in focus or a more competitive environment for fintech startups.

Fintech Funding Slides in Q1 2024

Fintech funding experienced a 16% quarter-over-quarter decline in Q1 2024, reaching its lowest level since early 2017, according to CB Insights' Q1 2024 State of Venture Report. However, there was a 15% uptick in equity deal-making during the same period, with 904 investments made into fintech startups—an increase from the previous quarter's 786 investments. This discrepancy suggests that investors remain interested in fintech solutions, particularly in the payments technology sector.

Banks Embrace Smaller Renewable Energy Projects

Banks have traditionally financed large-scale renewable energy projects, but smaller projects have often been overlooked due to lower profitability. However, demand for these projects has been growing, leading to the creation of a green bank. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently awarded $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations, which will use the funds to underwrite loans for smaller-scale renewable energy projects, including residential installations and affordable housing retrofits.

Grok now generates headlines and open-sourced, raising transparency questions. [67 characters]","Title: xAI's Grok Chatbot Now Accessible to More Users: A Rival to ChatGPT and Google's Gemini

Social network X has recently announced that it is expanding the accessibility of xAI's Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers. Initially, only Premium+ users could interact with the chatbot, but now users paying $8 per month can also enjoy this feature in select regions. This move comes after Elon Musk announced the expansion to more paid users last month.

Grok, a Large Language Model (LLM) product, allows users to chat in either ""Regular mode"" or ""Fun mode."" However, like any other AI chatbot, Grok may sometimes return inaccurate answers, which is why it displays labels indicating the possibility of inaccuracies. Recently, Grok has added a new explore view, where the chatbot summarizes trending news stories, similar to products like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude.

However, Grok seems to go one step further than just summarizing stories by generating headlines. As Mashable pointed out, the chatbot wrote a fake headline saying, ""Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles."" This raises concerns about the credibility and ethical implications of AI-generated content.

Elon Musk's intention behind making Grok more accessible might be to rival other AI chatbots in the market. Over the last few months, Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations. In March, Musk even sued the company over the ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goal, claiming that OpenAI had strayed from its original mission. In response, OpenAI filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk's claims and released email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

Furthermore, xAI open-sourced Grok last month, although without providing any training data details. This decision raises questions about the latest version of the model and whether the company will be more transparent about its approach to the development of the model and information about the training data.

IN-OFFICE—A Deep Dive

The Landscape of Remote Work

In the late 1980s, working from home was a rarity. Fast-forward to today, and 14% of the U.S. workforce now works remotely full-time. This number is projected to reach 20% by 2023, as reported by USA Today. Moreover, 58% of white-collar employees express a desire for work schedule flexibility, allowing them to work from home a few days a week. The pandemic has undoubtedly fueled this shift, but it is also a reflection of changing generational attitudes towards work-life balance.

Despite the increasing popularity of remote work, some CEOs advocate for a return to the office. Companies like IBM and Amazon have been pushing hard to get employees back to their desks. However, this push might be driven by more than just a desire to fill office buildings. There may be underlying motivations, such as the need for in-person managerial control or a belief that employees are more productive within an office environment.

The Great Debate: Productivity and Satisfaction

Research from the University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business suggests that return-to-office mandates may not improve firm performance. In fact, these mandates could negatively impact employee satisfaction without any tangible benefits for companies.

Karen Mangia, a prominent author and expert on remote work, found that employees tend to value flexibility over location. They prefer controlling when they work, prioritizing work-life balance. Companies that offer such flexibility tend to have more engaged and productive employees. However, forcing employees to return to the office could lead to higher burnout rates, negatively affecting productivity.

Remote Work and Diversity

Hiring remote workers broadens the talent pool, enabling companies to access a more diverse range of candidates. Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, shares an example of a Midwestern consumer packaged goods company that expanded its talent search beyond its local area. As a result, the company discovered better candidates than it had previously found.

Finding the Right Balance

The debate continues regarding how much time, if any, employees should spend in the office.

In cybersecurity, the cost of zero-day exploits skyrockets as companies enhance product security. Firms like Crowdfense & Zerodium pay millions for tools to hack popular devices, software, chat apps. cybersecurity SEOtitle","Title: The Soaring Value of Zero-Day Exploits: A New Era of Cybersecurity

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, a striking trend has emerged: the cost of zero-day exploits has reached astronomical figures. Companies like Crowdfense and Zerodium are now offering millions of dollars for tools that can hack popular devices, software, and chat apps. These exploits, known as ""zero-days,"" take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to their makers. Let's delve into the reasons behind this surge in prices and what it means for the future of cybersecurity.

Companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have been fortifying their devices and apps against hackers, making it increasingly challenging to exploit vulnerabilities. Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, stated, ""It should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we're using, whatever devices we're using."" As a result, the time and resources required by attackers to find and exploit these vulnerabilities have increased, leading to a rise in the cost of acquiring zero-days.

In its latest price list, Crowdfense has increased its payouts for zero-days significantly. The company is now offering between $5 and $7 million for iOS zero-days, up to $5 million for Android zero-days, and up to $3.5 million for Safari zero-days. These figures represent a substantial jump from the previous payouts of $3 million for Android and iOS zero-days in 2019.

Google's Threat Analysis Group reported that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild in 2023, with 75% of zero-days targeting Google products and Android being attributed to spyware vendors. As vendors continue to bolster their security measures, the difficulty of exploiting vulnerabilities will increase, causing prices to rise even further.

David Manouchehri, a security analyst with knowledge of the zero-day market, said, ""Hard targets like Google's Pixel and the iPhone have been becoming harder to hack every year. I expect the cost to continue to increase significantly over time.""

Introduction

Autism, a complex neurodevelopmental condition, affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, according to the CDC. Early diagnosis is crucial for improved developmental outcomes. EarliTec Diagnostics, an Atlanta-based startup, recently secured $21.5 million in a Series B funding round to expand its innovative system, which assists clinicians in diagnosing children as young as 16 months old. This article delves into the groundbreaking technology, its potential impact on autism diagnosis and treatment, and the growing interest in autism-focused healthcare from venture capitalists (VCs).

The EarliTec Diagnostics System

EarliTec Diagnostics' FDA-authorized approach involves having children watch short videos and social interactions on a screen for 12 minutes while the device uses artificial intelligence (AI) to track the child's eye movements. The startup's technology is currently employed by eight clinicians across six U.S. states. According to EarliTec, children with autism will not focus on the video in the same way that neurotypical children do. The system's primary advantage is its quick, 12-minute test, which expedites the diagnostic process, allowing clinicians to work with more children and providing faster support for children and their families.

A Growing Trend in Autism-Focused Healthcare Investments

EarliTec Diagnostics' success in fundraising, despite the challenge of attracting investors to the autism space, is a testament to the growing interest in autism-focused healthcare. In 2021, The Autism Impact Fund raised a $60 million fund, 20% higher than its initial target of $50 million. Moreover, Divergent Ventures launched a $10 million fund in 2021, focusing on early-stage companies across the neurodiversity spectrum. This trend reflects a broader awareness of autism prevalence and the unmet need for autism-focused solutions.

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity, evolving from a niche product to a mainstream staple in home offices during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become household names, offering a plethora of layouts and components for enthusiasts to choose from. However, with the standardization of features such as RGB lighting and gasket-mounted keyboards, the market has become somewhat stagnant. Enter magnetic switches, a novel technology that promises to revolutionize the way we interact with mechanical keyboards.

Magnetic switches offer the unique advantage of quickly adjusting the actuation point, or the distance required to register a keystroke. Traditional mechanical switches rely on physical contact between the switch's legs and metal leaves to complete an electrical circuit. In contrast, magnetic switches utilize magnets and springs, activating by sensing changes in the magnetic field. This design allows for the actuation point to be easily customized, providing gamers and typists with unprecedented control over their keyboard's performance.

The Hall Effect, a principle that has been around since the 1960s, is the driving force behind magnetic switches. Dutch keyboard startup Wooting popularized this technology, which relies on a permanent magnet in the stem and a sensor on the keyboard's PCB to precisely register the switch's position. The result is a highly adaptable keyboard that caters to various user preferences and applications.

Customization is at the heart of magnetic switches. Users can modify the actuation point to accommodate different use cases, such as gaming or typing. For instance, gamers may prefer a lower actuation point for faster response times, while typists might opt for a higher actuation point to reduce accidental keystrokes. This versatility is achieved through simple key combinations or manufacturer-provided software tools, allowing users to tailor their keyboards to their specific needs.

Another benefit of magnetic switches is their ability to detect not only the actuation point but also the release point. This feature enables users to rapidly trigger keys during gaming sessions, preventing unwanted keypresses and enhancing overall control. Additionally, the high degree of customization enables users to experiment with various settings without having to physically replace switches.

EV Adoption: The Gap Between Consumer Demand and Market Reality

Automakers recently reported Q1 sales, and the data highlights a critical issue in the EV market: pricing. According to a recent Edmunds survey, 47% of consumers are seeking EVs priced below $40,000, and 22% are interested in EVs priced below $30,000. However, the current market offers no new EVs below $30,000 and only four models below the $40,000 mark. The average price of an EV in 2023 is $61,702, while all other vehicles stand at $47,450.

This mismatch between consumer expectations and market offerings is causing downward pressure on prices, forcing automakers to delay future EV launches and shift their focus toward hybrids. Even Tesla, the EV bellwether, has experienced a 20% decrease in deliveries in Q4 2023, and Rivian's results have been lackluster. To counteract this, Tesla has adopted a two-pronged strategy: reducing prices and attempting to capture revenue through its Full Self-Driving software, currently offered as a free one-month trial to all customers.

Startup News: Fundraising and Closures

In the startup world, Maniv, an Israel and NYC-based VC firm, recently raised a $140 million fund to invest in early-stage startups at the intersection of mobility, transportation, and energy. Meanwhile, Ghost Autonomy, an autonomous driving startup, has closed its doors after raising over $220 million and partnering with OpenAI. The company had completed a highway driving product and was moving into urban environments for last-mile delivery but was unable to secure the necessary funding to bring the product to market.

Let’s dive right in!

Y Combinator’s Demo Days:

Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator recently held its Demo Days, where startups present their ideas to investors. Our venture desk covered day one and day two, highlighting the most promising startups and analyzing the trends that emerged. Our AI expert also curated an exclusive roundup of AI-focused companies, showcasing the growing influence of artificial intelligence in the startup landscape.

Quantum Computing Breakthrough:

Microsoft and quantum computing startup Quantinuum announced a significant breakthrough in the field of quantum computing. The companies claim to have run thousands of experiments on a quantum computer without a single error, a feat that could potentially revolutionize the industry. However, as with any groundbreaking claim, it’s essential to maintain a healthy skepticism until the results are peer-reviewed and independently verified.

Apple’s Home Robot:

In a twist that feels like a page out of a science fiction novel, Apple is rumored to be developing a home robot. According to reports, the tech giant has assigned Apple Home and AI executives to work on a robotics project for households, though details remain scarce. Given Apple's track record of creating elegant and user-friendly products, the prospect of a home robot from the company is intriguing, to say the least.

Canoo’s Expenses:

EV startup Canoo made headlines this week when it was revealed that the company paid $1.7 million in 2023 for its CEO’s private jet, which is double the amount of revenue generated that year. While it's not uncommon for CEOs to use private jets for business travel, this revelation raises questions about the company's financial management and allocation of resources.

AT&T Data Leak:

Phone giant AT&T faced a massive data leak, with a cache of customer records dumped online earlier this month. The company responded by resetting millions of account passcodes in an attempt to secure user data. Data breaches like this one underscore the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in today's interconnected world.

Title: Apple's New App Store Rules: Embracing Retro Gaming and Streamlined In-App Purchases

Introduction:
Apple has recently updated its App Store rules, introducing some significant changes that will impact both developers and users. Among these updates, Apple has opened its doors to retro console game emulators and streamlined in-app purchases for various services.

Global Availability of Retro Console Game Emulators:
In a move to bring nostalgia to users worldwide, Apple now allows emulators for retro console games on the App Store. Developers must ensure that they adhere to copyright rules, as they will be held responsible for any potential infringements. This decision may attract developers from the Android platform, which already hosts numerous emulators for classic games.

New In-App Purchase Mechanisms:
Emulator apps on the App Store must incorporate an in-app purchase mechanism for digital items. With these changes to the App Store rules, Apple aims to generate additional revenue streams, especially after adjusting its policies to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules.

Expanding In-App Purchases to More Services:
Apple has also expanded in-app purchases to include HTML5-based mini-apps, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. This change may pave the way for super apps like WeChat to offer their services through the App Store.

Tesla's robotaxi is set to launch, emphasizing its commitment to autonomous transportation and innovation. Musk confirmed the August 8 unveiling, dismissing reports of abandoning low-cost EV plans.

Introduction

In a groundbreaking announcement, Tesla is poised to unveil its much-anticipated robotaxi on August 8, as confirmed by CEO Elon Musk. This revelation comes just hours after Reuters published a report claiming that the automaker was abandoning its plans to develop a low-cost electric vehicle (EV). The report also mentioned that Musk had directed Tesla's resources towards robotaxis built on the company's compact-vehicle platform.

Dismissing the Report

Musk, known for his active presence on social media, quickly responded to the Reuters report by accusing the news organization of lying. While he didn't specify which part of the report was false, it is likely that he was contesting the claim that Tesla had canceled its plans for a more affordable EV. The CEO had previously expressed optimism in January about the upcoming $25,000 EV, which was expected to be available in the second half of 2025.

The Robotaxi Concept

The impending arrival of the robotaxi is an exciting development in the world of autonomous transportation. Tesla's robotaxis will be built on the company's small-vehicle platform, aligning with Musk's directive. As the company shifts its focus to these driverless vehicles, it remains to be seen how Tesla will successfully implement the robotaxi concept using its camera-only system.

A Challenging Path Ahead

Tesla's decision to rely solely on cameras for its driver assistance technologies is a bold one. Competitors in the autonomous vehicle space, such as Waymo, use radar and other sensors extensively. This difference in approach may present challenges for Tesla, particularly in navigating complex driving scenarios and ensuring passenger safety.

Despite these hurdles, Tesla's robotaxi announcement reflects the company's unwavering commitment to innovation and progress in the EV and autonomous transportation industries. With the robotaxi set to launch on August 8, we can expect Tesla to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of sustainable and autonomous transportation.
