Introduction

In an era where resource depletion and rising raw material prices pose significant challenges, particularly for metal-dependent economies like South Korea, innovative solutions are crucial. The concept of a circular economy, which emphasizes resource efficiency and waste reduction, has emerged as a promising approach. This article explores a groundbreaking technology developed by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi and his team at the Water Resource Cycle Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). They have devised a method to selectively recover high-purity gold from electrical and electronic waste using textile materials, offering a potential solution to the global e-waste problem.

The Challenges of Metal Recovery

Traditional adsorbents for metal recovery are typically granular, providing high specific surface areas for efficient adsorption. However, their underwater control is challenging, resulting in low recovery rates and potential environmental pollution. Fiber-like materials offer a more practical solution due to their ease of underwater manipulation and adaptability to various shapes through weaving processes. Nonetheless, their thinness and low strength make them susceptible to breakage during gold recovery applications.

Innovative Approach to Gold Recovery

The KIST team has chemically immobilized alkaline molecules on polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers, enhancing both molecular gold recovery performance and structural stability. This amine-containing polymeric fiber (ALPF) boasts a significantly larger surface area, boosting the adsorption performance of gold ions (Au) in waste by up to 2.5 times compared to the team's previous granular gold adsorption material.

The ALPF's gold recovery performance remains effective across a wide pH range, from 3 to 12, and various initial concentrations of gold solutions. The FESEM images reveal the presence of Au(0) particles on the ALPF surface, confirming successful gold recovery. The XRD patterns further validate this, exhibiting characteristic peaks of metallic gold after the recovery process.

Comparison with Existing Adsorbents

The ALPF adsorbent's maximum adsorption capacity (qm) for Au(III) ions stands at an impressive 1,462 mg/",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/extracting-high-purity.jpg,2024-04-23 10:28:43,"Revolutionize gold recovery with textile materials: Adsorb up to 2.5 times more gold ions.

Title: The Power of Small: Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini Language Model

In the era of AI, where larger models are often seen as the key to better results, Microsoft is making a case for smaller, more efficient models. The tech giant has recently unveiled Phi-3 Mini, the first in a series of three compact AI models, with the other two being Phi-3 Small and Phi-3 Medium, set to launch in the coming months.

Microsoft has trained Phi-3 Mini on 3.8 billion parameters, making it the smallest model in the series. The next models, Phi-3 Small and Phi-3 Medium, will be trained on 7 billion and 14 billion parameters, respectively. To put these numbers into perspective, OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo is reported to have been trained on over a trillion parameters, while Meta's Llama 3, set to launch in 2024, will have been trained on 700 billion parameters.

The number of parameters a model is trained on directly impacts its capability to deliver results. However, more parameters also mean higher power and energy consumption. While larger models may be ideal for complex queries or critical AI implementations, smaller models like Phi-3 Mini are more suitable for lower-powered devices such as smartphones. 

Microsoft has designed Phi-3 Mini to perform well, despite its smaller size. According to the company, Phi-3 Mini offers the same performance as models trained on more than 10 times the number of parameters. Although it may not match the capabilities of GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo, it is as capable as GPT-3.5. 

To achieve this performance, Microsoft trained Phi-3 Mini on a ""curriculum"" that included children's books. The company also used a larger model to generate AI-created children's books to supplement the real-world material. 

Microsoft is making Phi-3 Mini available for free on its Azure cloud platform, Hugging Face, and Ollama, an AI model service. By focusing on smaller, more efficient models, Microsoft is demonstrating that bigger isn't always better in the world of AI.

Introduction

In an era where generative AI and social trends converge, Easel is a pioneering startup that allows you to create images of yourself and your friends engaged in various activities, all derived from your favorite iMessage conversations. Founded by two ex-Snap employees, this innovative company is poised to revolutionize the way we communicate and express ourselves in the digital world.

Snapchat's Innovative Legacy

Before discussing Easel, it's essential to acknowledge the influence of Snap, the company where the co-founders gained their experience. Snapchat, often overlooked in comparison to Instagram and TikTok, has been a trailblazer in social innovation. Before AR and VR became mainstream, Snap introduced lenses, which have left a significant cultural impact. Similarly, Snap's acquisition of Bitmoji in 2016 seemed like a fad at the time, but virtual avatars are now an engaging and popular way to communicate across various platforms.

The Birth of Easel

Easel is the brainchild of Rajan Vaish and Sven Kratz, former members of Snap's research team. After their team was disbanded due to Snap's layoffs, the duo decided to continue innovating outside the company. Easel uses generative AI to create personalized stickers that resemble Bitmoji-style images. Users provide a few seconds of their face, which Easel then uses to train an AI model and generate unique stickers.

Easel's Multiplayer Experience

Easel is not just about image generation; it is a multiplayer experience integrated into the native iOS Messages app. This integration ensures that users do not need to create a new social graph or move to a new platform to enjoy Easel's features. Sending and receiving stickers is as simple as sharing images via iMessage, and the recipient can install Easel and remix the stickers, creating a shared experience.

A new secure and efficient machine-learning accelerator, developed by engineers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, protects sensitive information while maintaining high performance. The accelerator uses data splitting, lightweight ciphering, and key generation to tackle vulnerabilities and safeguard user data.","Title: A Secure and Efficient Machine-Learning Accelerator for Health Monitoring Apps

Introduction

Health-monitoring apps have become an essential tool for many individuals, helping them manage chronic diseases or maintain fitness goals. These apps rely on machine-learning algorithms to analyze user data, but they can be slow and energy-inefficient due to the large models being transferred between a smartphone and a central server. To address this issue, engineers have developed machine-learning accelerators to enhance computation speed and efficiency. However, these accelerators are susceptible to attacks that can compromise user data. In response, researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have created a secure and efficient machine-learning accelerator to protect sensitive information while maintaining high performance.

Machine-Learning Accelerators: Speed and Security Trade-off

Machine-learning accelerators, such as digital in-memory compute (IMC) chips, help streamline computation by performing calculations inside a device's memory. IMC chips store pieces of a machine-learning model, reducing the amount of data that must be moved back and forth between the device and the server. However, IMC chips can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks, where hackers monitor power consumption to reverse-engineer data, and bus-probing attacks, which steal bits of the model and dataset by probing the communication between the accelerator and off-chip memory.

To tackle these vulnerabilities, the research team developed a three-pronged approach for their secure machine-learning accelerator: data splitting, lightweight ciphering, and key generation.

1. Data Splitting

To prevent side-channel attacks, the researchers introduced data splitting, a technique that breaks data into random pieces. When a bit is processed, it is divided into multiple pieces to ensure that no single operation can reveal the original information. To simplify the process of splitting data, the researchers optimized the computations required to generate the random bits, reducing the amount of computing needed.

2. Lightweight Ciphering and Key Generation

To protect against bus-probing attacks, the team implemented a lightweight cipher that encrypts the model stored in off-chip memory. This cipher requires only simple computations and is decrypted only when necessary. Additionally, the researchers generated a unique key directly on the chip using a physically unclonable function (PUF",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2018/chip.jpg,2024-04-23 12:25:15,"Meta Description: Discover the new Tesla Model 3 Performance!

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology, social robots are becoming increasingly prevalent. These robots are designed for interaction with humans, yet the focus on their development has predominantly centered around design features, often neglecting crucial sociological factors. A groundbreaking study by Cornell and Indiana University scholars specializing in human-robot interaction highlights the importance of considering human-to-human interactions, contexts, and cultural norms in the development of social robots.

The Value of Sociological Perspectives

Malte Jung, co-author and associate professor of information science at Cornell University, emphasizes the need to expand the scope of social robot research beyond programming and physical design. Human sociality, he argues, is not solely determined by a robot's features but also by the interactions between people surrounding the machine. By observing and understanding these interactions, researchers can create more effective and socially adept robots.

Award-Winning Research

The research paper, titled ""Constructing a Social Life with Robots: Shifting Away From Design Patterns Towards Interaction Ritual Chains,"" received the Best Paper award at the Human-Robot Interaction conference. Based on extensive fieldwork by Waki Kamino, a doctoral student in information science, the study explores Tokyo's robot-friendly culture, revealing the essential role of manufacturers, owners, and communities in shaping the social lives of robots.

Tesla investors, bracing for potentially underwhelming Q1 earnings, are adjusting to a new set of priorities for the company, with CEO Elon Musk doubling down on autonomous driving technology. As Tesla prepares to report its Q1 earnings on Tuesday, the focus is on maintaining profitability while advancing self-driving capabilities.

The anticipated earnings report follows a turbulent period marked by a 43% drop in Tesla's share price since the beginning of the year. Despite the share price slide, Tesla's stock experienced a brief uptick of over 2% on the day of the earnings release. This positive blip is a rare glimmer of optimism in an otherwise downward trend that has gained momentum since early March.

Musk's unwavering commitment to autonomous driving is reflected in two main areas: increasing the adoption of the Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance system and investing in a robotaxi initiative. In a recent move, Tesla lowered the price of its FSD system by $4,000, now available for $8,000, and dropped the monthly subscription fee from $199 to $99. These adjustments aim to encourage wider FSD adoption and accumulate more data to strengthen the neural networks underpinning fuller-scale autonomy.

However, Tesla's pursuit of autonomous driving comes with significant costs, putting pressure on the company's profitability. In response, Tesla recently laid off 10% of its workforce to reduce expenses and prepare for its ""next growth phase."" This move follows Musk's abrupt announcement of pausing the development of Tesla's $25,000 electric vehicle in favor of a robotaxi, expected to be unveiled in August. This strategic pivot, which caught employees off guard, highlights the new priority placed on robotaxi development.

In addition to these changes, Tesla is simultaneously adjusting its electric vehicle pricing strategy. While the company eliminated inventory price discounts, it reduced prices for the Model 3 and Model Y by up to $2,000 in the U.S., China, and Germany. These price cuts, similar to those seen in","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1232815520.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-23 16:33:09,"Meta Description:

Smart windows, a groundbreaking technology capable of regulating light and heat, stand as a promising solution to enhance energy efficiency in buildings. However, their widespread adoption has been hindered by high costs and limited availability. A recent study by researchers at The University of Texas at Austin is set to revolutionize this landscape through the development of a new type of electrochromic device and materials, utilizing common and sustainable resources.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, introduces a device that relies on eco-friendly, affordable materials derived from abundant biomass sources such as corn, potatoes, and beans. The key to this innovation lies in amylose, a natural polymer, which enables the achievement of excellent optical properties, sustainability, and easy preparation of electrochromic materials and devices.

A researcher from Virginia Commonwealth University has made a groundbreaking advancement in the field of deception detection. By training a computer to analyze data from a 2002 game show, this expert has taken a significant step towards determining the veracity of statements made in high-stakes situations.

According to Xunyu Chen, an assistant professor in the Department of Information Systems at VCU's School of Business, human behavior provides a wealth of cues for discerning trust and deception. Chen and his team have employed artificial intelligence methods, such as machine learning and deep learning, to capitalize on these behavioral cues for more effective decision-making.

In their study, ""Trust and Deception with High Stakes: Evidence from the 'Friend or Foe' Dataset,"" published in Decision Support Systems, Chen and his colleagues utilize a unique dataset derived from the American game show ""Friend or Foe?"" This show is based on the prisoner's dilemma, a fundamental concept in game theory that investigates the challenges and benefits of cooperation and non-cooperation between two individuals.

Traditional lab experiments used to study trust and deception have limitations, such as reduced realism and generalizability. High-stakes deception, as observed in game shows, demands greater cognitive resources for behavioral management and often results in stronger emotional and behavioral fluctuations, such as facial expressions, verbal cues, and body language.

Chen's research has led to the identification of multimodal behavioral indicators of deception and trust in high-stakes decision-making scenarios. These indicators can be used to predict deception with high accuracy, paving the way for the development of an automated deception detection system.

The findings of this research have broad implications for various fields, including presidential debates, business negotiations, and court trials. By analyzing human behavior in high-stakes scenarios, practitioners can utilize this predictive model to identify deceit and protect self-interest.

This research marks a significant milestone in understanding deception and trust behaviors, which can result in substantial consequences. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, researchers and practitioners can now explore new avenues for predicting human behavior in various contexts.

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning-based models that can generate various types of content have made significant strides. These advancements have opened new possibilities for filmmaking and robotics research, with AI showing potential in creating realistic or artistic images based on text descriptions. However, generating videos of moving human figures based on human instructions has remained a challenge. A promising new framework, presented at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024, addresses this challenge.

Researchers from Beijing Institute of Technology, BIGAI, and Peking University have introduced an innovative two-stage framework that builds upon their previous work, HUMANIZE. This new framework effectively generates human motion in 3D scenes using natural language instructions while significantly improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.

The proposed method consists of two main stages: Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) and Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM). The ADM predicts scene affordance maps from language descriptions, while the AMDM generates human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance map. By utilizing affordance maps derived from the distance field between human skeleton joints and scene surfaces, the model effectively links 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation inherent in this task.

There are several advantages to this new framework compared to earlier approaches for language-guided human motion generation. The representations used by the model clearly define the region associated with a user's descriptions/prompts, enhancing its 3D grounding capabilities. This allows the model to create convincing motions with limited training data and provides a deep understanding of the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, aiding its generalization across diverse scene geometries.

The key contribution of this work lies in leveraging explicit scene affordance representation to facilitate language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. This study demonstrates the potential of conditional motion generation models that integrate scene affordances and representations.
