Introduction

Interacting with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has become increasingly common in various applications, including data processing and machine learning tasks. However, the influence of minor changes in prompts on the accuracy of LLM-generated labels remains largely unexplored. In a recent study, researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) investigated the effects of prompt variations on LLM predictions, revealing that subtle changes can significantly impact model outcomes.

The Four Categories of Prompt Variations

The researchers examined four categories of prompt variations:

1. Output formats: Requesting responses in specific formats commonly used in data processing, such as lists or CSV files.
2. Minor perturbations: Making minor alterations to the prompt, like adding extra spaces at the beginning or end, or incorporating polite phrases.
3. Jailbreaks: Using techniques to bypass content filters for sensitive topics like hate speech detection.
4. Incentives: Offering different amounts of tips for ""a perfect response.""

Testing the Prompt Variations

The researchers tested these prompt variations across 11 benchmark text classification tasks, evaluating model performance in tasks such as toxicity classification, grammar evaluation, humor and sarcasm detection, and mathematical proficiency.

Key Findings

The study revealed the following insights:

1. Output formats: Adding a specified output format led to a minimum of 10% of predictions changing.
2. Minor perturbations: Introducing spaces or common greetings in prompts resulted in more than 500 (out of 11,000) prediction changes.
3. Jailbreaks: Using jailbreaks on tasks led to a significant proportion of changes, with the impact varying depending on the specific jailbreak used.
4. Incentives: Tipping had minimal performance changes, while certain jailbreaks could result in significant accuracy loss.

Implications

These findings suggest that researchers and developers should carefully consider prompt design when working with LLMs. While specific formatting or perturbation methods may improve accuracy in certain tasks, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Thus, it is crucial to test various prompt variations and closely monitor model performance.

Introduction

Green hydrogen, a potential future clean energy carrier, is gaining significant attention. Solar energy is a promising candidate for generating this green hydrogen due to its widespread availability and minimal dependence on natural topography. However, solar energy output and generation are subject to fluctuations caused by factors such as season and weather, leading to repetitive increases and decreases in power. This variability can damage the components of production devices, necessitating precise evaluation of the durability of these devices under power fluctuations. Dr. Bora Seo's research team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has taken a significant step forward in this area.

A New Durability Evaluation Technique

The KIST team, led by Director Yoon Seok-jin, has developed a durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices using actual solar irradiance data with step durations as short as one second. This technique simulates fluctuations in actual solar energy output more accurately than any other developed method, thanks to the shortest step duration.

Existing durability evaluation methods have limitations in reflecting solar output variability, relying solely on simple methods such as periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Furthermore, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions.

A Solar Irradiance-Based Simulation Method

The KIST team has developed a simulation method that converts irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data obtained from solar panels and water electrolysis stack data. This has significantly shortened the step duration from 10 seconds to 1 second, allowing fluctuations in solar output to be accurately reflected.

Key Indicators for Material Development

Based on the newly developed durability evaluation technique, the team has proposed key indicators for the material development of green hydrogen production devices. Standardized analysis methods for assessing performance degradation of materials such as catalysts and electrolyte membranes have been proposed, along with indicators of performance degradation such as catalyst leaching amount, fluoride release rate, and thickness of passivation layer. These guidelines can be utilized for the development of materials and components to improve the durability and performance of green",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/development-of-durabil.jpg,2024-04-08 09:25:03,"""Discover KIST's innovative solar irradiance-based durability evaluation for green hydrogen production devices.

New controllers based on T-S fuzzy descriptor models improve stability and optimization for nonlinear systems, demonstrated via a rotary inverted pendulum.","Title: Revolutionizing Nonlinear Control: Intelligent Controllers for Dynamic Systems

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous, playing a crucial role in various fields, from robotics to economics. Unlike their linear counterparts, nonlinear systems' output is not proportional to the input, making their mathematical modeling and control challenging. One powerful tool to address this issue is the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system, which uses fuzzy logic to map input and output values to multiple linear systems. This system forms the foundation for several nonlinear control methods, including the popular Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC).

In recent years, the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS) has emerged, combining the T–S fuzzy system with the space-state representation. FDSs offer a more robust and accurate representation of physical systems by describing them in terms of state, input, and output variables. However, optimal control strategies for T–S FDSs remain largely unexplored, with existing robust control methods introducing additional complexity and optimization challenges through Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI).

To tackle these limitations, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan and including Thi-Van-Anh Nguyen, Quy-Thinh Dao, and Duc-Binh Pham from Hanoi University of Science and Technology developed novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model. Their research was published in Scientific Reports.

The researchers employed the Lyapunov stability theory to establish stability conditions for the FDS mathematical model. These conditions were then transformed into LMI to facilitate the creation of three controllers: a stability controller using PDC for managing deviations, an optimal controller minimizing a cost function for optimal control, and a robust-optimal controller combining the benefits of both.

To demonstrate the efficacy of these controllers, the team tested them on a rotary inverted pendulum, a challenging system where an inverted pendulum sits on a rotating base, and the goal is to keep the pendulum upright by controlling the base's rotation. Simulation results showed that the stability controller effectively stabilized the system with small initial displacement angles, while the optimal controller significantly reduced",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-robust-optimal-c.jpg,2024-04-08 11:32:04, Fuzzy Descriptor Systems , Fuzzy Descriptor Systems ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Drones have become increasingly popular in various industries, offering aerial perspectives and data collection that was previously difficult to obtain. However, battery life continues to be a significant limitation for drone usage. Although commercial models can stay airborne for up to 45 minutes on a single charge, the ability to extend flight time would be advantageous for numerous applications. Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark are tackling this challenge by developing drones capable of recharging directly from power lines.

In a recent breakthrough, these scientists attached a gripper system to a Tarot 650 Sport drone, which they outfitted with a customized electric quadcopter propulsion system, an autopilot module, and other essential components. When the drone's systems detect low battery levels, the device utilizes its camera and millimeter-wave radar system to locate the closest power line.

The drone then maneuvers beneath the power line, extending a pair of inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into the gripper. An inductive charger draws current from the power line, recharging the battery as needed. Once the battery reaches full capacity, the gripper releases the power line, and the drone resumes its mission.

Initially, the researchers envisioned drones used for inspecting power lines as the primary beneficiaries of this charging system. In 2022, they unveiled a self-charging drone prototype that topped up its battery from power lines. In their latest project, they refined the gripper system and demonstrated a real-world application for this technology.

At the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the team presented their work as ""a first-in-the-world system with the ability to sustain operation throughout many inspection/charging cycles powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment."" In their most successful test, the drone remained airborne for over two hours, completing five cycles of power line inspection and charging.

Unlike classical computers that rely on bits (0s and 1s) to process information, quantum computers use qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to the principle of superposition, and can be entangled, allowing for a higher degree of complexity and parallelism in computations. However, the challenge lies in maintaining the quantum state of qubits, which are highly susceptible to disturbances and errors.

The collaboration between Microsoft and Quantinuum has resulted in a significant advancement in quantum error correction. As TechCrunch reported, the two companies achieved a ""major breakthrough"" by encoding several physical qubits into a single logical qubit. This approach simplifies the process of detecting and correcting errors, and it has been proven effective in over 14,000 experiments without a single error.

This achievement is crucial for the future of quantum computing, as error rates significantly impact the technology's performance. A lower error rate means that quantum computers can perform more accurate and reliable calculations, making them more appealing for a wider range of applications.

Imagine a world where quantum computers can help us:

1. Model complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to design new materials and drugs more efficiently.
2. Optimize logistics, supply chain, and resource management, reducing waste and costs.
3. Improve artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning models to make better predictions and recommendations.
