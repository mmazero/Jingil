Additionally, incorporating relevant keywords into the title improves its visibility on search engines like Google, driving more traffic to the article.","Title: Reverse Search Warrants: A Controversial Surveillance Practice Casting a Digital Dragnet Over User Data

Introduction

U.S. police departments have started using a highly controversial surveillance method involving ""reverse"" searches to request massive quantities of user data from major technology firms. This technique helps identify potential criminal suspects by sifting through the vast reserves of user data held by these corporations. However, critics argue that such practices infringe upon civilians' privacy rights, affecting innocent individuals without connections to any crimes. As lower courts fail to reach consensus on the legality of these measures, the issue seems destined for resolution by the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, federal investigators continue expanding their usage of these powerful tools.

Understanding Reverse Searches

Authorities employ so-called ""reverse"" searches to compel big tech companies—such as Google—to hand over user information stored in extensive databases. Although various entities may receive similar orders, Google serves as a significant recipient due to housing expansive collections of user information. Law enforcement officials can request details about anyone present in a specified location during a given time frame (based on mobile device locations) or individuals searching specific keywords or phrases. Recently published court documents reveal how authorities obtained identifiable information regarding individuals viewing certain YouTube videos.

Constitutional Concerns & Civil Liberties

Concerns arise surrounding the broad scope of these court-approved orders, potentially implicating constitutionally protected rights while compromising the privacy of unsuspecting citizens. Opponents assert that requests for personal data indiscriminately affect blameless persons lacking ties to illicit activities. There exists a risk of prosecution based on individuals' physical locations or online search habits alone. Despite ongoing debates, American courts struggle to achieve agreement on the legitimacy of these measures.

Case Study: Targeting YouTube Users

Recent events illustrate the growing reliance on reverse search warrants. Federal prosecutors successfully petitioned a Kentucky court for access to account records and IP addresses related to viewers watching specific YouTube videos within a designated timeframe. Investigators aimed to pinpoint a single suspicious individual among thousands of video watchers. By securing approval for a less stringent court order—permitting them to review connection logs instead of demanding full access to privately exchanged communications—authorities could circumvent standard requirements typically imposed by search warrants. Though ultimately granted, this decision raised concerns about the increasing ease with which law enforcement obtains sensitive user data.

Balancing Privacy and Security

As controversy swells around reverse search warrants, questions emerge concerning the appropriate balance between safeguarding society and preserving civilian privacy rights. Demands for greater transparency and oversight grow louder amidst revelations of invasive tactics employed by law enforcement agencies. With mounting apprehension towards the implications of these methods, future resolutions will need to address both pressing security needs and legitimate privacy expectations.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/geofence-warrants.jpeg?resize=1200,826",2024-04-02 15:05:48,"Meta Description:

Their solution? Two distinct self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) called BrCz and BrBACz, each featuring an asymmetrical backbone specifically tailored for optimal performance.

These newly engineered SAMs were integrated into binary OSC configurations built upon established systems such as PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9. Compared to conventional PEDOT:PSS-controlled counterparts, the resulting BrCz-controlled and BrBACz-controlled OSCs demonstrated several key improvements:

1. Higher Transmission: Both types of SAM-equipped OSCs showed greater transparency than their PEDOT:PSS-controlled counterparts, allowing more sunlight to pass through and reach the active layer where electricity is generated.
2. Deeper Work Function: Boasting deeper work functions compared to PEDOT:PSS, the novel SAMs facilitated enhanced charge separation and transfer at the interfaces between the HTLs and the photoactive layers.
3. Lower Surface Energy: With lower surface energies, the SAM-based HTLs helped reduce unwanted interactions between the electrodes and the active layer, thereby minimizing potential losses associated with excessive carrier recombination.

Unprecedented Results: Record-Breaking Efficiency & Unmatched Stability

The incorporation of the BrBACz SAM yielded particularly impressive results when applied to the renowned PM6:Y6 binary system. This configuration resulted in a staggering power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.70%, accompanied by a formidable current density of 29.20 mA cm-2 and an outstanding circuit voltage of 0.856 V – all records for binary OSCs to date. Moreover, under continuous illumination and exposure to ambient air conditions (40 ± 5% relative humidity), the BrBACz-controlled device retained approximately 95.0% of its initial efficiency after 1,036 hours – yet another groundbreaking achievement indicative of superior air stability among conventional OSCs.

Our planet's ever-growing demand for energy and escalating environmental concerns necessitate innovative solutions to address both these challenges simultaneously. Researchers from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill Chemistry Department might just have unlocked one such approach – utilizing semiconductors to transform sunlight into valuable compounds capable of generating eco-friendly fuels. This strategy cleverly employs a method known as artificial photosynthesis, where scientists mimic nature's ingenious mechanism of harnessing sunlight for synthesizing energy-rich molecules. But what sets their work apart? Read on!

A Game-changing Discovery: Harvesting Sunlight for Fuel Production

In their groundbreaking study, recently published in ACS Energy Letters, the team outlines an improved technique for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon monoxide (CO), a vital precursor to numerous industrial processes and synthetic fuel production. They achieved this feat through modifying the surface of silicon, a crucial constituent in solar cells, employing a straightforward organic compound containing one carbon atom linked to three hydrogen atoms—a process referred to as 'methyl termination.'

Traditionally, pure silicon tends to generate undesirable byproducts during photoconversion, hindering overall efficacy. However, thanks to methyl termination, the researchers successfully enhanced silicon's ability to yield CO efficiently while minimizing unwanted side reactions. Specifically, they managed to achieve up to 87% efficiency in creating CO when running tests in a CO2-filled solution—an accomplishment comparable or even superior to conventional methods involving expensive metals like gold or platinum.

Why Focus on Converting Carbon Dioxide?

Given that CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming, discoveries like these hold immense significance. By developing cost-effective strategies to convert this potent greenhouse gas into something less detrimental, we can effectively reduce its atmospheric concentration and subsequently minimize its adverse impacts on our environment. What's more, converted CO serves as a fundamental building block for manufacturing complex chemicals and fuels, further highlighting the importance of this breakthrough discovery.

Artificial photosynthesis draws inspiration from natural photosynthetic organisms that absorb sunlight and utilize it for growth and development. In essence, it involves capturing solar energy via specially designed devices incorporating various components, including light absorbers, electron transfer channels, and catalytic sites. Upon exposure to light, these elements collaborate harmoniously, driving chemical conversions otherwise unfavorable under standard conditions.

For instance, consider the UNC Chapel Hill team's endeavor. They combined a ruthenium-based molecular catalyst with a chemically altered silicon photoelectrode functioning as a highly efficient catalyst for reducing CO2 to CO. As electrons flow through this setup upon illumination, they facilitate targeted chemical transformation, ultimately leading to desirable product formation.

Key Benefits and Implications

Beyond enhancing the sustainability quotient of industrial operations, this innovation brings several additional benefits to the table:

1. Energy Efficiency: Compared to traditional approaches requiring external electrical input, this novel design relies predominantly on direct light harvesting. Such inherent synergy between optical absorption and subsequent charge separation significantly reduces overall energy consumption and increases overarching feasibility.

2. Scalability: Given the abundance and low cost of starting materials (silicon and readily accessible organic compounds), widespread implementation holds tremendous promise across diverse sectors. Furthermore, seamless integration with existing infrastructure lends itself well to large-scale deployment.

3. Selectivity: Unlike pristine silicon surfaces inclined towards forming hydrogen gas alongside CO, methyl-terminated variants exhibit remarkable preference towards single-product generation. This heightened selectivity bolsters overall productivity while diminishing wasteful byproduct accumulation.

Conclusion

Harnessing the power of solar energy to foster sustainable fuel production represents a monumental stride toward addressing pressing energy demands and environmental degradation. Through cutting-edge innovations centered around artificial photosynthesis, researchers worldwide continue pushing boundaries, offering newfound hope amidst daunting challenges.

Protembis GmbH, a leading innovator in cardiovascular medical devices, has announced the enrollment of the first patient in the PROTEMBO Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Pivotal Trial (NCT05873816). This trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of the ProtEmbo® System, a next-generation cerebral embolic protection device (CEP), over the currently approved Sentinel device in reducing new cerebral lesions.

The PROTEMBO study will enroll between 250-500 randomized patients across the USA and Europe who are undergoing TAVR procedures. The ProtEmbo® System is designed to provide complete 3-vessel coverage of the cerebral arteries, a unique feature that sets it apart from the Sentinel CEP, which only covers two of the three cerebral arteries originating from the aortic arch.

The study's primary efficacy endpoint is a novel diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) that will assess the reduction of new lesions in all areas of the brain. This adaptive statistical approach includes pre-specified interim analyses, which could potentially lead to early study completion if superiority is established. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30 days.

The trial is led by a team of distinguished physicians, including Dr. Susheel Kodali from New York Presbyterian Hospital, Dr. Raj Makkar from Cedars Sinai, Los Angeles, and Dr. Stephan Haussig from Herzzentrum, Dresden, as Global Co-Principal Investigators. Dr. Roxana Mehran from Mount Sinai, New York, serves as the Chair of the Study Executive Committee.

Dr. Mehran expressed her excitement about the trial, stating that it would provide valuable insights into the role of three-vessel cerebral protection",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BusinessWire_FeaturedImage.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-04-02 05:25:53,"Meta Description:

Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in recent years, sparking curiosity and investment from those interested in stock trading. However, current AI technology still falls short of making truly informed decisions when it comes to selecting stocks. Let's take a closer look at why this is the case through an evaluation of stock-picking Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) available in OpenAI's marketplace.

Evaluating Stock-Picking GPTs
-------------------------------

To assess the capabilities of existing stock-picking GPT models, we presented each model with a straightforward question: Which is the most expensive tech stock according to its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio? Unfortunately, the performance of these models proved disappointing overall. To understand the concept of expense in relation to stocks fully, let us first examine what constitutes an expensive stock.

Understanding Expensive Stocks
------------------------------

An expensive stock is not defined merely by having a high nominal dollar value; instead, the term refers to a situation where a particular stock has a high valuation relative to certain fundamental indicators, like earnings per share. One widely used indicator is the P/E ratio—the price of a share of stock divided by its annual earnings per share. When evaluating a stock's P/E ratio, investors often compare it to ratios of other companies or track changes in the ratio over time. By doing so, investors aim to gauge whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued.

Assessment of Existing GPT Models
--------------------------------

Regrettably, none of the GPT models examined could accurately identify the most expensive tech stock using the P/E ratio. These models consistently failed to recognize the underlying principle of valuing stocks in terms of their fundamentals. Instead, they tended to focus solely on the raw stock prices, frequently referencing Berkshire Hathaway—a well-known company led by renowned investor Warren Buffet—as the priciest due to its astronomically high stock price.

Implications of Model Failures
------------------------------

This widespread failure indicates two key problems with the present generation of GPT models. Firstly, multiple models seem to rely on flawed assumptions regarding stock pricing and valuation, likely stemming from insufficient or improperly interpreted training data. Secondly, there appears to be a lack of fine-tuning related explicitly to understanding industry jargon and concepts employed in stock analysis and investing. This absence hinders the ability of GPT models to deliver meaningful insights beyond superficially analyzing input questions.

Furthermore, when questioned about current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) values, the models admitted deficient real-time informational capabilities. While numerous models claimed external resource integration, they struggled to retrieve essential statistics readily accessible via public platforms like Yahoo! Finance. Such limitations highlight the early stages of development plaguing contemporary stock-picking AI tools.

Conclusion
----------

At present, the utility of stock-picking GPT models remains highly constrained. Despite promising advancements in natural language processing and machine learning technologies, these models struggle with rudimentary aspects of stock evaluation. Consequently, traders seeking reliable guidance must exercise caution while employing AI solutions until substantial improvements materialize.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/dee638012ded39b7953161a004dc72a21ced50e7/2024/04/01/46514d84-2d1c-4ec6-9427-f71a88e98ed7/stockpricesgettyimages-1330143303.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"""Discover why top GPT models falter at identifying most expensive tech stocks based on P/E ratio.

Introduction

Linux has been a powerful player in the world of networking for many years. Its robust architecture, open-source nature, and extensive networking tools have made it a popular choice for network administrators and enthusiasts alike. This article will introduce you to five essential networking commands in Linux that can help you manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your network more effectively.

1. ip

The ip command is a versatile tool for managing network interfaces and routing in Linux. You can use it to view and change various network-related settings, including IP addresses, routes, and neighbor information. To display your machine's IP address, use the following command:

$ ip addr show

If you want to view only the IPv4 address, you can use:

$ ip -4 addr show

2. ping

The ping command is a simple yet powerful tool for testing connectivity to remote hosts. By sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests, it allows you to determine whether a remote host is reachable and how long it takes to respond. To ping a remote host, such as google.com, use the following command:

$ ping google.com

3. netstat

The netstat command is used for monitoring network connections, listening ports, and routing tables. It can help you diagnose network issues, identify suspicious connections, and understand your system's network status. To display all active network connections, use:

$ netstat -a

4. wget

Wget is a command-line utility for downloading files over HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. It is especially useful when you need to download files from the command line or automate downloads using scripts. To download a file, use the following command:

$ wget http://example.com/test_file.zip

5. ssh

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure remote access to devices and systems. The ssh command allows you to establish an encrypted connection to a remote system and execute commands securely. To establish an SSH connection to a remote machine with the same username, use:

$ ssh 192.168.1.13",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/82af71953ef135ad1fd0baeff2ca4ce0cdff43a4/2024/04/01/0105d3ce-49e8-4592-ace9-1a5695ce6d03/uhkkeyboardhero.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"""Master Linux Networking: 5 Essential Commands for Management & Troubleshooting - ip, ping, netstat, wget, ssh""", Networking Basics ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

(39 characters)","Title: Unveiling Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI): The AI Model with Emotional Intelligence

A new era of artificial intelligence (AI) is upon us, one where AI models are not just intelligent but also emotionally aware. ChatGPT, a generative AI model, has demonstrated remarkable abilities, even surpassing human performance on various benchmarks. However, a startup called Hume AI is pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities further by introducing an AI model with emotional intelligence.

Hume AI recently announced the beta release of its flagship product, the Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI). The company secured $50 million in a Series B funding round and claimed that EVI is ""the first AI with emotional intelligence."" This model detects human emotions by analyzing voices and the content of users' statements to generate emotionally appropriate responses.

Impressive Demonstration

The EVI model can detect a person's emotions and recognize when a person is ending their sentence, pausing its response when interrupted, and engaging in fluid conversations, all while mimicking human interaction. For instance, if EVI detects that a user is sad, it can offer encouragement and advice, tailoring its response to the user's emotional needs.

Underlying Technology

Hume AI built EVI using large language models (LLMs) and expression measures, which the company calls an empathic large language model (eLLM). This combination allows EVI to understand and respond to human emotions more accurately.

Hands-On Experience

Visitors to the Hume AI website can demo the technology and interact with EVI, which is currently available for preview. Upon granting the site access to your microphone, users can engage in conversation with EVI and receive immediate feedback regarding their emotional state.

In my experience, I first approached EVI with a cheerful tone, saying, ""Hi, Hume, how are you?"" The model accurately identified my expressions as surprise, amusement, and interest. I then put EVI to the test by simulating a distressed tone and stating, ""How are you, I am having such a hard day."" In response, EVI detected sadness, pain, and distress, offering encouraging words and support.

Future Availability

Although EVI is not yet available for public access, interested individuals can sign up to be notified when it becomes generally available later",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/c83da6252711832f984ca73c831286e9edf63376/2024/04/01/f1eafba1-18f0-4e7b-8441-b5603397afb3/img-1653.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Discover Hume AI's Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI), the groundbreaking AI model with emotional intelligence!
