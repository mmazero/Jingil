Title: SMRs: The Future of Carbon-Free Power?","Title: The Future of Small Modular Reactors: A Clean Energy Solution

Introduction

In the face of rising energy demand and the need for cleaner power sources, small modular reactors (SMRs) have emerged as a potential solution. Despite setbacks, including the cancellation of a next-generation US nuclear plant, SMR manufacturers remain optimistic that new projects will come online by the end of the decade. This article explores the current state of SMRs, their potential benefits, and the challenges they face in a rapidly changing energy landscape.

The State of Small Modular Reactors

Several nations have pursued the phase-out of nuclear plants, but SMR manufacturers are confident they can win over skeptical customers. The recent cancellation of a US nuclear plant has not dampened the enthusiasm of backers of carbon-free power. In fact, new SMR projects are in development, both in the US and abroad.

One such project is GE Hitachi's BWRX-300, which aims to begin producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, as early as 2029. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned US power company, has also invested in the BWRX-300. These projects highlight the potential for SMRs to contribute to a cleaner energy future, provided they can overcome the challenges that have plagued earlier nuclear initiatives.

Addressing Cost Concerns

Some of the cost increases associated with nuclear power are not unique to the industry but are instead due to higher prices for steel and other commodities. Additionally, uranium prices have also risen. To address these concerns, companies like TerraPower are focusing on innovative technologies that can be operated with less labor and fewer costly materials.

TerraPower, which is supported by an investor group that includes Bill Gates, is developing a novel liquid sodium-cooled fast reactor technology. The company plans to begin construction on a nuclear reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming, at a retired coal plant in June. By standardizing across multiple projects, the US nuclear industry hopes to lower costs and increase efficiency.

Another company, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, has selected Gadsden, Alabama for its Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) assembly plant, which is expected to go online in 202",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/several-nations-have-m.jpg,2024-04-07 13:36:00,"Meta Description:

Introduction

In an era where TikTok-style short-form videos are taking the world by storm, Uber Eats is joining the party. The popular food delivery app has launched a new short-form video feed to enhance food discovery and help restaurants showcase their offerings in a more engaging way. This move follows the footsteps of other social media and entertainment apps, such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Netflix, and even LinkedIn, which have all introduced their own versions of short-form video features.

The New Uber Eats Short-Form Video Feed

The new Uber Eats short-form video feed is currently being tested in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto, with plans for a global rollout in the future. The feed, designed to replicate the experience of being in a restaurant and watching food being prepared, will feature videos from nearby restaurants to deliver a more personalized experience for users.

To access the feed, users will see video previews in carousels across the app, including the home screen. Once they click on a preview, they will be taken to a vertical feed of short-form content that they can swipe through. This format is similar to TikTok, allowing users to quickly browse and discover new dishes from their favorite local eateries.

Empowering Restaurants and Inspiring Users

Uber Eats' senior director of Product, Awaneesh Verma, explained that the primary goal of the new feature is to inspire users to try new dishes and provide restaurants with a platform to showcase their offerings in a more engaging way. The early data suggests that users are more confident in trying new dishes after watching the short-form videos, as they can see the texture, portion size, and ingredients of a dish before deciding to order.

It's worth noting that the videos are not ads, and Uber Eats is not charging merchants for content placements. This move helps restaurants reach customers directly as they decide what to order, while also providing users with a more engaging way to discover new dishes and restaurants.

Supporting Merchants and Boosting Business

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E capturing the imagination of hundreds of millions of people. This excitement, however, has also attracted cybercriminals who seek to exploit the uninitiated. According to Bitdefender, scammers are using the allure of AI features and services to trick Facebook users into downloading malicious software. Let's delve into this alarming trend and explore how you can protect yourself.

The Scam: AI as Bait

Scammers have been hijacking Facebook Pages and disguising them as legitimate AI services, such as OpenAI's video creation tool Sora and image creation tool DALL-E. They run ads on Facebook's network, promising early access to experimental AI research and products. Once users follow these Pages, the scammers post AI-generated content to make the Page appear authentic. They then encourage followers to download software, purportedly for using the experimental AI services, which are actually malware designed to steal data.

Case Study: Midjourney AI

The most popular Facebook Page discovered by Bitdefender, Midjourney AI, amassed 1.2 million followers before Facebook removed it in March 2024 for violating its policies. Despite the takedown, other similar Pages emerged, turning the situation into a game of digital Whac-A-Mole. The scammers cleverly manipulated the original Page's name and garnered 637,000 followers by the time of Bitdefender's report.

Red Flags and Safety Measures

Several red flags accompanied these scams. For instance, users were directed to download software via Google Drive or Dropbox links, and closer inspection of the Pages revealed they were not directly associated with the companies they claimed to represent.

To stay safe, remember that tech companies do not use Facebook Pages to promise access to experimental features. They also never share third-party links for downloading their software. To protect yourself, follow these guidelines:

Introduction

Have you ever wondered if the way you phrase a request to a large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, can affect its response? As it turns out, it does. Researchers at the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) have been exploring how subtle variations in prompts can significantly influence LLM predictions. Their findings, posted on the preprint server arXiv, reveal that modifications in requests can have a considerable impact on the model's output.

The Four Categories of Prompt Variations

The researchers examined four categories of prompt variations:

1. Requests for responses in specific output formats, such as lists or CSV.
2. Minor perturbations to the prompt, like adding extra spaces or incorporating polite phrases.
3. The use of ""jailbreaks,"" which are techniques used to bypass content filters for sensitive topics.
4. Offering different amounts of tips for a ""perfect response.""

Testing the Prompt Variations

The researchers tested these variations across 11 benchmark text classification tasks, which typically involve categorizing or assigning labels to text data based on their content or meaning. These tasks included toxicity classification, grammar evaluation, humor and sarcasm detection, and mathematical proficiency, among others.

Key Findings

Their findings revealed that even minor alterations in prompt structure and presentation could substantially impact LLM predictions. Some notable observations include:

1. Adding a specified output format led to a minimum of 10% of predictions changing.
2. Minor perturbations, such as introducing a space at the beginning or end of a prompt, resulted in over 500 (out of 11,000) prediction changes.
3. Using jailbreaks resulted in a larger proportion of changes but was highly dependent on the specific jailbreak used.
4. The ""No Specified Format"" achieved the highest overall accuracy, outperforming other variations by a full percentage point.

Implications

These findings suggest that prompt design plays a crucial role in shaping model performance. While certain prompt strategies, such as incentives or specific greetings, demonstrated marginal enhancements in accuracy, the impact of prompt variations on LLM predictions is undeniable.

The realms of music and technology have been intertwined for centuries, with the music industry continuously evolving to adapt to new technological breakthroughs. As we enter the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the industry must address emerging issues to ensure that music and technology continue to coexist harmoniously.

One challenge lies in the training of large language models (LLMs) on data that companies might not have the right to use. While regulators will eventually provide the necessary ""teeth"" to compel AI developers to comply with ethical guidelines, it's essential to galvanize grassroots support and drive the need for updated copyright laws.

The music industry has experienced various technological innovations that have not replaced human involvement. For instance, drum machines did not dampen the enthusiasm for live drumming performances, and track recording did not eliminate the need for orchestras. Music sampling, once a contentious issue in copyright conversations, has become an integral part of creating new sounds.

GenAI has the potential to benefit both musicians and the general public. Songwriters can explore a broader range of instruments and recording processes, while beginners can utilize natural language processing and conversational prompts to learn new instruments more easily. Music, as a whole, will continue to evolve with GenAI, creating another inflection point in its development.

Roland, a Japanese manufacturer of keyboards and drum machines, aims to lay the groundwork for an AI-driven environment where music creators are equitably recognized and compensated for their work. In partnership with Universal Music Group, Roland has released ""Principles for Music Creation with AI,"" outlining a responsible approach to AI use in music creation, production, composition, and songwriting.

These principles, which align with Universal's Human Artistry Campaign, encompass seven core values, including the belief that AI will amplify human creativity and the importance of transparency in building trustworthy AI. Key aspects of these principles include obtaining authorization for using copyrighted works and music artists' names, images, likenesses, and voices, as well as compensating artists fairly.
