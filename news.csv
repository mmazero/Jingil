Lapse: A Nostalgic Twist on Modern Photography

In the era of digital photography, where instant gratification and endless editing options reign supreme, a new app called Lapse is taking us back to the simpler days of analog cameras. With Lapse, you can experience the charm and anticipation of waiting for your photos to ""develop"" before sharing them with a select group of friends.

A Growing Phenomenon

Since its launch, Lapse has gained significant traction, boasting millions of users, 100 million photos captured monthly, and a consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photography apps. This recent $30 million funding round, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, will fuel Lapse's ambitious plans for the future.

Behind the Scenes Magic

Lapse is more than just a retro-inspired app; it employs a sophisticated blend of technology and artistry to enhance your photos. Each image undergoes a 12-step processing journey, involving computer vision, in-house algorithms, and third-party technology. This meticulous treatment ensures that your photos look their best, optimizing subjects and composition.

The Allure of Simplicity

In a world saturated with social media platforms vying for our attention, Lapse offers a refreshing alternative. It eschews advertising and focuses on the core essence of photography: capturing and sharing moments with loved ones. This simplicity has resonated with users, particularly those yearning for a more authentic and intimate social experience.

Growth and Challenges

Lapse's initial growth strategy involved using growth-hacking techniques and forced invites. While this tactic helped boost downloads, it also raised concerns about sustainability and user experience. The company has since shifted its focus to organic growth, relying on the app's unique features and word-of-mouth recommendations.

A Gap in the Market

The rise of Lapse highlights a growing demand for simpler, more private social media platforms. Consumers are increasingly wary of the data they share and the impact of social media on their well-being. Lapse taps into this desire for a more authentic and controlled online experience.

The Future of Lapse

Lapse's latest funding round will enable it to expand its features, explore video capabilities, and potentially introduce monetization strategies that align with its ethos. The company aims to create a thriving community where users can connect with friends, share their lives, and cherish the moments that matter.

A New Era of Social Media

Lapse represents a shift in the social media landscape, offering a refreshing alternative to the dominant platforms. Its focus on simplicity, privacy, and authentic connections resonates with users seeking a more meaningful online experience. As Lapse continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how it shapes the future of social media.

The Nostalgia of Analogue Photography, Reimagined for the Digital Age

In the era of digital photography, the charm of analogue cameras has faded into obscurity. The cost and hassle of film, batteries, and development have made it an expensive and impractical pursuit. But what if you could experience the nostalgia of analogue photography without the hefty price tag?

Enter Lapse, a smartphone app that brings the essence of analogue photography to the digital realm. With Lapse, you can take photos that you can't see until they're ""developed,"" mimicking the anticipation and excitement of waiting for your film to be processed.

A Growing Phenomenon

Since its launch, Lapse has gained immense popularity, boasting millions of users and a consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store. This success has attracted the attention of investors, who have recently poured $30 million into the company to fuel its growth.

Behind-the-Scenes Magic

While Lapse emulates the analogue experience, it also incorporates technological advancements to enhance your photos. The app employs computer vision and other techniques to analyze your images, optimizing the composition and making your subjects look their best.

A Different Path to Monetization

Unlike many social media apps that rely on advertising, Lapse is exploring alternative revenue streams. CEO Dan Silvertown believes that the company can avoid the pitfalls of excessive advertising by focusing on providing a unique and valuable experience to its users.

Ethical Concerns and Growth Strategies

Lapse has faced scrutiny for its initial use of growth-hacking tactics, such as forced invites. However, the company has since shifted its approach, recognizing the importance of user trust and organic growth.

A Niche in the Social Media Landscape

In a world saturated with social media giants, Lapse offers a refreshing alternative. It focuses on sharing with small groups of friends, providing a private and intimate space to connect.

The Future of Lapse

Lapse is poised to expand its offerings, with plans for enhanced photo editing features and a potential foray into video. The company's investors believe that there's a growing demand for simpler, more authentic social media experiences, and Lapse is well-positioned to fill that void.

Lapse is a testament to the enduring appeal of analogue photography. By combining the nostalgia of the past with the convenience of the present, it offers a unique and engaging way to capture and share life's moments with those you care about.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/synflora/,SynFlora is working on bioengineering a skincare revolution,"

In the bustling halls of 4YFN at the MWC tradeshow in Barcelona, a Spanish biotech startup called SynFlora unveiled a groundbreaking concept for skin treatment technology. Led by three PhD-holding co-founders, SynFlora aims to revolutionize skincare by harnessing the power of skin microbes.

Their vision is to go beyond the limitations of topical creams and develop targeted, novel therapeutics by engineering skin microbes. This approach promises deeper treatment penetration than traditional skincare products, enabling a wider range of applications.

""We're creating a new foundation for skin products, not just molecules that can't penetrate the skin,"" explains co-founder and CEO Nastassia Knōdlseder. ""It's like a molecular machine, a bacteria that can travel deep into the hair follicles and produce new effects.""

SynFlora's initial focus is on acne, and they've already published a study in Nature Biotechnology demonstrating the effectiveness of their experimental treatment delivery approach in mice. However, they envision a much broader range of applications, including mosquito repellents, fat loss treatments, vaccines, and anti-inflammatory therapies.

""We can potentially trigger the immune system or create vaccines against melanoma,"" Knōdlseder explains. ""We can also produce anti-inflammatory molecules.""

SynFlora's platform technology has the potential to transform skincare and beyond. With patents for various indications and the platform itself, the startup is poised to make a significant impact.

Currently, SynFlora is in the early stages of development and is seeking funding through a seed round. They anticipate that their novel system could power a new generation of skin-delivered therapeutics within one to three years, pending regulatory approval.

SynFlora's innovative approach to skincare is a testament to the power of biotechnology in unlocking new possibilities for health and wellness. Their work holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we treat and prevent a wide range of skin conditions and beyond.

In a world saturated with digital photography, a yearning for the simplicity and charm of analogue cameras has sparked a revival. Lapse, a pioneering startup, has captured the essence of this longing by introducing a smartphone app that emulates the analogue experience.

With Lapse, users can take pictures that they must wait to see ""developed,"" just like in the old days. There's no chance for editing or retaking, adding an element of anticipation and excitement to the process. Once developed, users can share their photos with a select group of friends, creating a more intimate and meaningful sharing experience.

Lapse has gained significant traction, boasting millions of users, 100 million photos captured monthly, and a consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photographic apps. This success has attracted a new round of funding worth $30 million, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, with participation from previous backers.

The company plans to use this funding to enhance the photo experience, introduce video capabilities, and explore monetization strategies that steer clear of intrusive advertising. Lapse's ethos centers around authenticity and simplicity, aiming to provide a refreshing alternative to the heavily edited and curated content that dominates social media platforms.

The app's mechanics are a blend of nostalgia and innovation. It employs computer vision and proprietary technology to optimize the composition and appearance of photos, ensuring visually appealing results. However, Lapse has faced criticism for its initial growth tactics, which involved forced invites and aggressive marketing.

Despite these concerns, Lapse remains committed to providing a genuine and user-friendly experience. It has moved away from forced invites and is finding organic growth through its journaling features and word-of-mouth recommendations.

Lapse's emergence reflects a growing desire for simpler and more authentic social media experiences. As consumers become increasingly wary of data privacy and the overwhelming nature of mainstream platforms, Lapse offers a refreshing alternative that focuses on meaningful connections and unfiltered moments.

Investors see potential in Lapse's unique approach. Jacob Andreou, a general partner at Greylock, believes that Lapse fills a void in the social media landscape by providing a dedicated space for users to connect with friends and share their lives without the distractions of news, entertainment, or influencer culture.

Lapse's journey is a testament to the enduring appeal of simplicity and authenticity in the digital age. As the company continues to evolve and refine its platform, it has the potential to reshape the way we share and connect with others through photography.

Title: The Art of Data Storytelling: A Harmonious Blend of Human and AI Capabilities

In today's data-driven world, storytelling has emerged as a powerful tool for businesses to communicate complex information, inspire action, and drive positive change. However, the sheer volume and complexity of data can make it challenging to extract meaningful insights and present them in a compelling manner. This is where the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise comes into play, creating a dynamic partnership that elevates the art of data storytelling.

The Essence of Data Storytelling: A Tapestry of Art and Science

Data storytelling is an intricate blend of art and science, requiring a unique combination of skills and knowledge. On the artistic side, it involves understanding business acumen, audience empathy, narrative formation, visual design, and messaging. On the scientific side, it benefits from analysis, psychology, and behavioral economics. This delicate balance makes data storytelling difficult to master and even more challenging to automate.

The Role of AI: A Scientific Ally in the Storytelling Journey

AI excels in the scientific aspects of data storytelling, particularly in handling technical and structured tasks. Its strength lies in processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and generating insights that might escape human attention. AI can assist in data cleansing, preparation, analysis, and visualization, freeing up humans to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of storytelling.

The Human Edge: The Art of Crafting Compelling Narratives

Humans possess distinct advantages in the artistic aspects of data storytelling. Our creativity, imagination, and emotional intelligence allow us to explore the data creatively, identify compelling narratives, and communicate key findings in engaging ways. We can adapt stories to the needs and interests of specific audiences, adjusting in real-time as they react. This human touch adds depth and authenticity to data stories, making them more persuasive and memorable.

The Path Forward: Augmentation, Not Automation

Rather than seeking to fully automate data storytelling, we should embrace the concept of augmentation. By combining the strengths of AI and human capabilities, we can create a powerful partnership that enhances the quality and impact of data stories. AI can augment human efforts by providing deeper insights, automating repetitive tasks, and generating alternative perspectives. Humans, in turn, can leverage AI's assistance to refine their storytelling approach, explore new possibilities, and create more impactful narratives.

Benefits of Human-AI Collaboration in Data Storytelling

The collaboration between humans and AI in data storytelling offers numerous benefits:

- Enhanced Efficiency: AI can handle data-intensive tasks, allowing humans to focus on higher-value activities such as strategy development and creative storytelling.

- Improved Accuracy and Consistency: AI's analytical capabilities can help identify errors and inconsistencies in data, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of insights.

- Broader Perspectives: By combining human intuition with AI's data-driven insights, organizations can gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues and make better decisions.

- Increased Creativity and Innovation: The interplay between human creativity and AI's ability to generate unexpected connections can lead to novel storytelling approaches and innovative solutions.

- Deeper Audience Engagement: Human storytellers can leverage AI's insights to tailor stories to specific audiences, creating a more personalized and engaging experience.

Conclusion: A Harmonious Partnership for Data Storytelling Excellence

Data storytelling is a powerful tool that, when combined with the capabilities of AI, can unlock a wealth of insights and drive meaningful change. However, it is essential to recognize the unique contributions of both humans and AI in this process. By embracing augmentation rather than automation, organizations can create a harmonious partnership that elevates the art of data storytelling, resulting in compelling narratives that inform, inspire, and transform.

The Intriguing Case of Renewcell: A Tale of Innovation, Challenges, and the Future of Textile Recycling

In the realm of sustainability, Renewcell emerged as a beacon of hope, pioneering textile-to-textile recycling technology. However, their recent bankruptcy filing raised questions about the viability of their approach. While their advanced recycling process is technically sound, the path to profitability remains elusive.

The crux of the issue lies in the specific waste requirements of Renewcell's technology. It demands a highly homogenous waste input, best met by post-industrial waste from manufacturing countries. However, the fashion industry's focus on post-consumer waste, particularly in the Global North, creates a mismatch between the technology's needs and the available feedstock.

The absence of a business case for Renewcell's recycled fibers in the competitive textile supply chain further complicates matters. Brands, typically removed from the intricacies of fiber sourcing, rely on garment manufacturers to handle costings and economies of scale. In a volatile market, committing to more expensive, albeit environmentally friendly, materials becomes a challenging proposition.

The solution may lie in integrating advanced recycling technologies into the existing textile supply chain in Asia, where the majority of textiles are produced. This would allow for end-to-end infrastructure and operational data to evaluate the business case without relying solely on sustainability narratives.

India, with its established mechanical textile recycling supply chain and rapidly expanding middle class, presents a promising opportunity for textile circularity. The Re-START Alliance, along with recent waste analysis initiatives, signals a growing commitment to a viable circular textiles economy in the region.

The future of textile-to-textile recycling hinges on aligning technological innovation with the realities of the global textile supply chain. By integrating these technologies into the heart of manufacturing hubs like Asia, we can unlock the potential for a truly circular and sustainable fashion industry.

Busting the Myth: Covid-19 Vaccines and Blood Donation

In the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, ensuring a steady supply of blood donations is crucial. However, recent rumors have surfaced, claiming that the American Red Cross prohibits blood donation after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. This misinformation poses a significant threat to the nation's blood supply, which is already facing a critical shortage.

The truth is, the American Red Cross explicitly allows blood donation after Covid-19 vaccination, except in rare circumstances. The organization's eligibility criteria state that individuals who have received non-replicating, inactivated, or RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, or AstraZeneca, can donate blood immediately, provided they are symptom-free and fever-free.

The temporary deferral of blood donation for two weeks applies only to individuals who have received live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines. These vaccines contain a weakened form of the virus, which may pose a potential risk to immunocompromised recipients. However, live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines are not widely available in the United States, and the vast majority of Americans have received non-replicating vaccines.

The American Red Cross's cautious approach is intended to ensure the safety of both donors and recipients. By asking about live attenuated vaccines, the organization aims to minimize the risk of transmitting any potential viruses through blood transfusions.

It's important to note that this deferral period is temporary. After two weeks, individuals who have received live attenuated Covid-19 vaccines can also donate blood without any restrictions.

The Red Cross emphasizes that blood donation is a safe and essential act of kindness, especially during this time of crisis. With the majority of Americans vaccinated against Covid-19, there's no need to worry about vaccine-related restrictions on blood donation.

If you're healthy and eligible, consider donating blood to help those in need. Your contribution can save lives and make a real difference in the fight against Covid-19 and other medical emergencies.

The Puzzling World of AI Measurement

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), we often grapple with the question of how to accurately measure its capabilities. Last week, MIT's Dylan Hadfield-Menell shed light on this complex issue, challenging our assumptions about the objectivity of data and the limits of classification.

Data: A Subjective Lens

Hadfield-Menell began by highlighting the fundamental idea that data is not an objective reflection of the world but rather a subjective representation. This concept becomes particularly relevant in the context of AI, where we rely on data to train and evaluate models.

The Enigma of Computer Vision

Using computer vision as an example, Hadfield-Menell posed a seemingly straightforward question: ""Is a picture a picture of a cat?"" While we might assume a clear-cut answer, he introduced the concept of ""adversarial examples"" – imperceptible changes to an image that can fool machine learning classifiers. This raises the question of whether the classifier's misclassification is truly an error or a reflection of the subjective nature of the data.

The Role of Programming

Hadfield-Menell emphasized that the data used to train AI systems is more akin to a program than a reflection of reality. By selecting specific data, we essentially encode our subjective desires into the system. This becomes evident in the case of ChatGPT, where different expectations and evaluations can lead to perceptions of ""laziness"" or improvement.

The Path Forward: Defining Success

Hadfield-Menell stressed the importance of defining clear criteria for evaluating AI models. This requires developers to articulate the goals of the system and the principles by which its success will be measured. By understanding the subjective choices made in the design process, we can better interpret and utilize AI's capabilities.

Conclusion

The measurement of AI remains a complex and evolving field. By embracing the subjective nature of data and the role of programming in shaping AI's behavior, we can navigate the challenges of evaluating and deploying these powerful technologies. The ability to explain the targeting and nature of AI models will be crucial for unlocking the full potential of AI in our society.

Unlocking Service Excellence: How Service Intelligence 2.0 Revolutionizes Issue Resolution

In the dynamic world of customer service, resolving issues swiftly and effectively is the key to maintaining customer satisfaction. Service Intelligence 2.0, guided by the principles of Master Data Management (MDM), emerges as a transformative approach to enhance issue resolution efficiency, empowering service agents with actionable insights and driving organizational success.

Consolidation: Unifying Knowledge from Diverse Sources

Service Intelligence 2.0 consolidates information from various platforms and sources, such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira, knowledge base articles, and product manuals, into a unified platform. This eliminates the challenge of searching through multiple platforms for relevant insights, enabling service agents to access all the necessary information at their fingertips.

Cleansing: Standardizing and Simplifying Data

The data consolidated from various sources often comes in different formats and with varying degrees of reliability. Service Intelligence 2.0 employs custom large language models and reference data checks to standardize and cleanse the data, making it easier to interpret and analyze. This process helps identify similar or divergent resolution paths across data sources, facilitating the capture of new insights and informing intervention strategies.

Governance: Ensuring Accuracy and Alignment with Organizational Goals

Service Intelligence 2.0 goes beyond data consolidation and cleansing. It also involves governance to ensure that the insights derived are accurate, unbiased, and aligned with the organization's objectives. Subject matter experts play a crucial role in this process, verifying the acquired knowledge, recommending additional steps and tests, and identifying any discrepancies between field practices and established recommendations.

Sharing: Democratizing Data for Informed Decision-Making

Once a unified repository of intelligent systems is established, Service Intelligence 2.0 democratizes data previously dispersed across various silos. This allows organizations to disseminate the repository or grant access to it through a centralized platform, enabling technicians to leverage shared data and its impact on service key performance indicators (KPIs).

Conclusion: The Ongoing Journey to Service Excellence

Service Intelligence 2.0 is a continuous journey, with manuals, knowledge articles, and new cases evolving constantly. The processes of consolidation, cleansing, governance, and sharing are ongoing efforts, ensuring that service agents have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information to resolve issues efficiently. By mastering MDM principles, organizations can harness the power of Service Intelligence 2.0 to drive informed decision-making, foster collaboration, and deliver unparalleled service excellence in today's competitive landscape.

Title: Barbie's Back with a Retro Flip Phone: Unleashing Nostalgia and Simplicity

In the wake of the Barbie movie's box office triumph, Mattel is poised to unleash another surprise hit with the Barbie flip phone, set to launch in summer 2024. Partnering with European smartphone manufacturer Human Mobile Devices (HMD), this revival aims to capture the essence of the iconic doll while offering a refreshing take on digital detox.

Unlike contemporary flip phones boasting advanced features, the Barbie flip phone embraces simplicity, harking back to the phone's original purpose: performing basic functions without distractions. This move aligns with the growing demand for digital detox, particularly among Gen Z, who seek a reprieve from the constant bombardment of notifications and social media feeds.

The phone's design exudes vintage charm, embodying the ""girl empowerment brand"" with a dash of pink and sparkle. It caters to the Gen Z movement embracing flip phones, who find solace in the traditional device that allows them to be present and enjoy moments without distractions.

As a Gen Z myself, I can envision my friends and I embracing the 90s nostalgia, stepping out with our pocketable pink flip phones, enjoying quality time without the burden of smartphones. Flip phones facilitate genuine connections and wholesome experiences, encouraging us to savor moments with friends, free from the distractions that modern smartphones bring.

While the Barbie flip phone holds immense appeal for weekend getaways and nights out, it's essential to acknowledge that smartphones remain indispensable for everyday life. The need to stay connected for work, social media, and news updates necessitates a primary smartphone.

The success of the Barbie flip phone hinges on its affordability. To justify purchasing a second phone, the price point must be attractive enough for those seeking a digital detox on weekends or during specific events. Many flip phone users opt for them as secondary devices due to their low cost, often around $20.

The allure of an unplugged, distraction-free summer with the Barbie flip phone is undeniable, but the ultimate decision to purchase will depend on the price, which is yet to be revealed.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-and-elon-musk-can-set-up-windows-11-without-a-microsoft-account/,How you (and Elon Musk) can set up Windows 11 without a Microsoft account,"

In the realm of technology, even the most renowned figures can encounter difficulties. Such was the case for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who recently faced an unexpected hurdle while attempting to set up his new Windows 11 laptop.

Musk's primary concern stemmed from the requirement to create a Microsoft account during the installation process. This stipulation raised his apprehension due to the potential access it would grant Microsoft's AI program, Copilot, to his personal computer. Musk expressed his discontent on social media, highlighting his discomfort with the mandatory inclusion of Copilot in Windows 11.

Musk's predicament sparked a broader discussion among Windows users, many of whom shared similar reservations about the intrusive nature of Copilot. Previously an optional feature, Copilot became an integral part of Windows 11 with the release of version 22H2. While users can temporarily disable Copilot through the Settings menu, it remains embedded within the system.

To achieve a permanent solution, users must delve into the intricacies of the Group Policy or Registry Editor. This process, however, is not without its challenges and carries the risk of unintended consequences for those unfamiliar with such modifications.

Musk, in his characteristically direct manner, opted for a more straightforward approach. He reached out to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella via text message, seeking assistance with the matter. Alternatively, he could have consulted Windows expert Ed Bott, who had previously addressed the issue in his articles.

Bott's workaround involves utilizing a dummy Microsoft account with a fabricated password. This approach allows users to bypass the mandatory account creation and establish a local account instead. However, this method comes with a caveat: the system's drive will not be automatically encrypted.

Users are thus presented with a dilemma: the choice between having Copilot on their system with the added protection of encryption or opting for a local account and foregoing the AI program at the expense of drive encryption. Those who choose the latter option can manually encrypt their drive using BitLocker or a third-party encryption program.

For those already using Windows 11 with a Microsoft account and seeking to revert to a local account, the process involves navigating through the Settings menu and following the prompts.

For individuals harboring deep-rooted distrust towards Windows and Microsoft AI, a viable alternative exists: Desktop Linux. Musk's own companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, rely heavily on Linux, making it a familiar and potentially appealing option for his personal computing needs.

It is worth noting, however, that Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, is known for his aversion to end-user tech support inquiries. Therefore, Musk should proceed with caution if he intends to seek direct assistance from Torvalds.
