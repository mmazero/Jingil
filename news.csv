Introduction

Allison Cohen, Senior Applied AI Projects Manager at Mila, is making significant strides in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. With a focus on socially beneficial AI projects, she collaborates with researchers, social scientists, and external partners to create tools that address pressing societal issues. From detecting misogyny to promoting sustainable farming practices, her work impacts various aspects of society. This article delves into Cohen's journey in AI, showcasing her accomplishments and insights on navigating the male-dominated tech and AI industries.

Breaking Into AI

Cohen became fascinated with AI during her Master's in Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. Recognizing its potential impact on world politics, she decided to pursue her interests further. An essay-writing competition provided her the opportunity to explore AI's implications on the labor market, earning her a spot at the St. Gallen Symposium in 2018. This experience bolstered her determination to contribute to the AI field.

Notable Accomplishments

Among Cohen's notable projects is the creation of a dataset identifying subtle and overt expressions of bias against women. Managing a diverse team of natural language processing experts, linguists, and gender studies specialists, she facilitated effective cross-discipline communication. Their efforts resulted in wide acclaim, including a spotlight recognition at NeurIPS and inspiring similar initiatives in other countries.

Navigating Challenges in Male-Dominated Industries

Despite progress, the tech and AI sectors remain male-dominated, hindering diversity and inclusivity. To combat this issue, Cohen draws inspiration from feminist standpoint theory, which emphasizes the importance of marginalized communities' perspectives in driving equitable change. By fostering strong relationships and seeking out allies, she promotes a more inclusive environment in the AI industry.

Raising AI Awareness Among Women Academics

To increase female representation in AI, Cohen advocates for raising awareness among women academics. Exposing them to the field's opportunities can encourage more women to participate and drive innovation. Furthermore, creating supportive networks and mentorship programs can empower aspiring women professionals to thrive in the sector.

Conclusion

Allison Cohen exemplifies dedication to advancing AI for social good. Her commitment to addressing gender disparities in technology and championing responsible application development sets a positive precedent for future generations. Through continued collaboration and a push towards greater inclusivity, the AI industry can unlock untapped potential and foster meaningful advancements benefiting society as a whole.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/women-in-ai-cohen.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-20 13:00:04,Discover how Allison Cohen drives AI for social good!

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/21/how-united-airlines-uses-ai-to-make-flying-the-friendly-skies-a-bit-easier/,How United Airlines uses AI to make flying the friendly skies a bit easier, United Airlines: Harnessing AI & Optimizing Cloud Infrastructure with CIO Jason Birnbaum ,"Title: Harnessing AI and Optimizing Cloud Infrastructure: A Discussion with United's CIO

Introduction

Imagine stepping aboard a United Airlines aircraft, knowing that behind the scenes, a dedicated team coordinates every aspect of your flight via a virtual chatroom. From ensuring enough overhead bin space to delivering special meals, these unsung heroes keep everything running smoothlyâ€”often with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) and efficient cloud infrastructure. Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with Jason Birnbaum, United's Chief Information Officer (CIO), whose vast experience spans multiple industries and technologies. Our conversation revolved around two key themes: the strategic role of AI in modern aviation and the importance of fine-tuning cloud infrastructure for optimal results.

Embracing Artificial Intelligence

As passengers, most of us seldom consider the intricate web of processes governing flight delays or seating arrangements. According to Birnbaum, ""Most of the time, that message is generated by AI."" When faced with unexpected circumstances such as inclement weather or mechanical issues, AI algorithms quickly assess available resources and generate messages informing passengers of adjusted departure times. Moreover, United recently introduced an AI-powered customer support chatbot capable of addressing common concerns and queries. By harnessing AI capabilities, United streamlines communication channels between staff members and customers alike, creating a seamless travel experience despite potential challenges.

Optimizing Cloud Infrastructure

Apart from embracing AI innovations, United continues migrating essential services to cloud environments, primarily Amazon Web Services (AWS). This shift enables enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reduced costs compared to traditional on-premises solutions. However, navigating cloud adoption successfully requires attention to various factors beyond mere migration, including monitoring application performance, managing sprawling data sets, and implementing robust security measures. As Birnbaum notes, ""Maybe the age of digital transformation is over, and we're now in the age of cloud optimization.""

Striking a Balance Between Legacy Systems and New Technologies

While the lure of cutting-edge technologies entices businesses worldwide, maintaining compatibility with existing systems remains crucial. Companies like United rely upon legacy software and hardware daily, often due to industry-specific requirements or unique operational nuances. Consequently, organizations must exercise caution during their transition towards modern architectures, avoiding unnecessary downtime or disruptions along the way. Birnbaum emphasizes this point, stating, ""We are extra careful as we move through this journey, to make sure we don't disrupt the operation or create self-inflicted wounds.""

Connectivity and Collaboration: Key Components of Modern Air Travel

One notable advantage of integrating advanced technologies involves improved connectivity across departments and personnel. Real-time visibility into critical aspects such as catering arrivals or passenger check-ins empowers ground crews and cabin staff to deliver exceptional service tailored to individual needs. Through thoughtful implementation of AI algorithms and reliable cloud infrastructure, United fosters collaboration among employees and enhances overall efficiency.

Conclusion

In summary, United Airlines exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to technological advancements, leveraging AI and cloud optimization strategies to elevate the flying experience for millions of passengers annually. Understanding the value of balancing innovative solutions with tried-and-true methods, the organization prioritizes seamless integration between disparate systems and invests in tools promoting cross-functional collaboration. Indeed, the future looks bright as United continues pioneering novel approaches to address complex challenges inherent in modern air travel.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_0412.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-21 15:00:01,"""Discover how United Airlines soars with AI & cloud infrastructure for efficient air travel.
