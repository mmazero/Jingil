The Future of Wireless Communication: Bending Light Around Obstacles

In the ever-evolving landscape of wireless technology, a groundbreaking study from Brown University and Rice University has brought us closer to overcoming one of the most challenging barriers in communication: physical obstructions. This article delves into the innovative research that could redefine the way we connect in the digital age.

The Bandwidth Dilemma

As we push the boundaries of cellular networks and Wi-Fi systems, we're rapidly approaching the limits of their bandwidth capabilities. The quest for higher communication frequencies is on, as scientists anticipate the need to shift beyond the current standards to accommodate our growing data demands.

Curving Light to Connect

The solution may lie in the realm of terahertz waves, poised to carry up to 100 times more data than our traditional microwaves. However, terahertz signals face a significant hurdle: they're easily blocked by solid objects, necessitating a clear path between transmitter and receiver—until now.

A Directional Shift

Imagine a Wi-Fi base station that blankets an entire room with connectivity. At terahertz frequencies, this omnidirectional approach is no longer feasible. Instead, a focused beam must track your movements to maintain a connection. Any obstruction, and the signal is lost.

The Curvature Breakthrough

Researchers have engineered a way to curve terahertz signals around obstacles. This novel technique involves self-accelerating beams—electromagnetic waves that naturally bend through space. By manipulating these beams, data can seamlessly transfer around blockages, keeping the communication link intact.

The Practical Implications

This advancement isn't just theoretical. Through simulations and real-world experiments, the team has proven the reliability of these curved beams. The potential is immense: more stable internet connections in obstructed spaces like crowded offices or urban landscapes.

Looking Ahead

While this innovation marks a significant stride forward, there's still a journey ahead before these terahertz networks become a reality. But the promise of faster, more reliable wireless communication is on the horizon, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists bending light to bridge gaps.

Scientists are reshaping the future of wireless communication using bendable terahertz (THz) waves. Traditional methods struggle with THz signals due to their susceptibility to blocking by solid objects; however, researchers from Brown and Rice Universities discovered a breakthrough – the ability to curve THz signals around obstacles.

Bandwidth Limitations and Frequency Needs

Currently, our reliance on cellular networks and Wi-Fi systems approaches the limit of their bandwidth capacities. Anticipating increased demand, researchers seek higher communication frequencies, such as those carried by THz waves. These carriers hold the potential to transport up to 100 times more data compared to conventional microwaves.

However, employing THz waves presents challenges. Unlike lower frequency counterparts, THz signals cannot penetrate walls or other common structures without substantial power loss. Consequently, establishing direct line-of-sight between transmitters and receivers becomes critical. In response, engineers devise targeted beams capable of tracking users’ locations. Unfortunately, any disruption severs the fragile links between devices.

Engineering Self-Accelerating Beams

To address this challenge, researchers developed self-accelerating beams that inherently bend through space, effectively curving THz signals around obstacles. Such curvature enables continuous data transmission even when faced with hindrances like furniture or building materials.

Dyson unveils CleanTrace, an AR enhancement for their Gen5detect vacuums. It ensures thorough cleaning by highlighting covered areas, aiming to optimize chores & challenge vacuuming norms.","Title: Dyson's CleanTrace: A New Era of Vacuuming with Augmented Reality

Dyson, the renowned vacuum cleaner manufacturer, has recently announced the launch of CleanTrace, an innovative augmented reality (AR) feature integrated into the Dyson Gen5detect system. Although the official release is set for June, it might be a tad too late for spring cleaning. Nevertheless, Dyson guarantees that this technology is no joke.

Contrary to what the press photos suggest, CleanTrace is not designed for use with headsets like Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest. Instead, it focuses on mobile devices, raising the question of whether people would indeed prefer to vacuum while wearing a computer on their heads. Regardless, this quirky feature is unlikely to sway those who are undecided about investing in a $700 ultra-premium Dyson vacuum.

Dyson's rationale behind CleanTrace stems from its robot vacuum mapping experience. According to Charlie Park, Dyson's VP of engineering, ""We realized that we could all learn a thing or two from the methodical cleaning approach of our robot vacuums. Unlike most humans doing the cleaning, Dyson robots know where they are in the room, where they have been, and where they have yet to go.""

In practice, CleanTrace overlays a purple (Dyson's signature color) path on the areas where the vacuum has passed. The ultimate goal is to cover the entire room with this hue, ensuring that every spot is thoroughly cleaned and not solely relying on one's outdated visual judgment. As a morning vacuuming enthusiast, I can attest to Dyson's claim that ""Our research shows that consumers regularly overestimate the amount of time they clean – data shows that around 80% of cleaning sessions last less than 10 minutes, yet people claim they vacuum for an average of 24 minutes per session.""

At its core, CleanTrace serves as a solution to an age-old problem: people generally dislike housework, including vacuuming. Consequently, we often exaggerate the time spent on these tasks daily. If CleanTrace can optimize the cleaning process and save time, it will be a welcome addition for users. Should this feature gain popularity, could vacuuming gamification be far behind?

Revolutionizing Roadside Assistance: The Yoshi Mobility Journey

A decade ago, the concept of on-demand fuel delivery was a mere spark in the minds of three visionaries: Bryan Frist, Nick Alexander, and Daniel Hunter. This spark ignited Yoshi Mobility, a startup that promised San Francisco drivers the convenience of gas delivered directly to their vehicles for a monthly subscription. The idea was simple yet revolutionary: why should anyone visit a gas station when the station could come to them?

Yoshi's founders saw an opportunity in an industry ripe for innovation. They envisioned a service that mirrored the convenience of Amazon's delivery model but catered to the automotive sector. Their ambition led them to Y Combinator's summer 2016 batch, where Yoshi began to accelerate, challenging contemporaries like Filld, Wrench, and Booster.

By 2017, Yoshi had expanded beyond fuel delivery, offering car washes, oil changes, and even windshield wiper replacements in cities like Atlanta and Nashville. The company's growth attracted $2.1 million in initial investments from notable figures, including ZhenFund, Joe Montana's Liquid 2 Ventures, and Ali Rowghani, a former Twitter executive and YC Continuity Fund's founding managing director. This was only the beginning, as Yoshi later secured an additional $36.7 million in Series A and B funding from heavyweights like ExxonMobil, General Motors Ventures, DN Automotive, and NBA All-Star Kevin Durant.

Fast forward to today, and Yoshi Mobility has evolved into a multifaceted enterprise headquartered in Nashville, with a presence in 15 states and the capability to service vehicles nationwide. The company has diversified into three core services: preventative maintenance, virtual vehicle inspections, and electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions. Yoshi's innovative approach has led to a tenfold increase in monthly revenue since its Series B round in late 2020.

The commercial sector now plays a significant role in Yoshi's operations, with virtual vehicle inspections becoming increasingly popular among fleet operators and gig economy workers. The company's recent acquisition of Mobile Auto Concepts Inc. has further expanded its service offerings, providing customers with a comprehensive one-stop-shop for automotive care.

Yoshi's latest venture into mobile EV charging is particularly noteworthy, positioning the company as a competitor to Tesla. Yoshi aims to address the current and future challenges of the EV market, offering on-the-go charging and maintenance services to EV owners and businesses without the space or desire to build their own charging stations.

The company's growth trajectory is supported by a $26 million Series C funding round, bringing its valuation to over $200 million. This round was led by General Motors Ventures and included new strategic investors like Bridgestone Americas, alongside international backers such as Universal Motors Agencies and Shikra Limited. With a total investment surpassing $60 million, Yoshi is poised to scale its preventative maintenance, virtual inspections, and EV charging services.

Yoshi's partnership with GM's OnStar and Toyota Connect allows it to interface with approximately 34% of vehicles on the road, offering a myriad of touchpoints from physical services to virtual telematics. Frist envisions Yoshi as the ""Amazon of car care,"" a company that entered the automotive space with a focus on fuel delivery but has since expanded its vision to encompass a broader range of services.

Internal whistleblowers at Faraday Future, an embattled electric vehicle (EV) company, allege that the organization has been less than truthful about its limited sales figures and has sought to punish employees who dare to question the veracity of these reports. In a pair of recently filed lawsuits in Los Angeles Superior Court, former employees José Guerrero and Victoria Xie accuse Faraday Future, its CEO Jia Yueting, and Head of Human Resources Nan Yang of deceit, retaliation, and various labor code violations. These revelations emerge amidst a broader context of financial instability, legal scrutiny, and ongoing investigations by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.

Central Tension and Leadership Control

At the heart of the matter lies a persistent struggle between Faraday Future's visionary yet controversial leader, Jia Yueting, and concerned members of the organization who feel that his influence remains pervasive despite being formally sidelined following an internal investigation in 2022. Both plaintiffs emphasize this dynamic, claiming that Jia continues to exert undue authority over the company and its decision-making processes.

Financial Turmoil and Misrepresentation of Sales Figures

As part of their accusations, Guerrero and Xie reveal that Faraday Future may have falsely reported the sale of its inaugural electric SUV, the FF91. According to the duo, the company declared four successful sales before completion of the transactions—three of which remained unpaid long after the announcement and the fourth settling more than sixty days later. Despite subsequent assurance of ten total deliveries throughout 2023, Guerrero and Xie suspect further deceptive practices. Their suspicion stems from pressure applied by management to prematurely publicize sales successes, even if such declarations contravened established protocols and potentially inflated the firm's stock value.

Retribution Against Concerned Employees

Beyond questions regarding sales authenticity, the two whistleblowers highlight instances where legitimate objections from sales personnel were met with hostility rather than constructive dialogue. When employees expressed concern over potential irregularities during the sales process, leaders affiliated with Jia responded punitively, leveraging human resources channels to suppress dissent. Such measures included targeting individuals raising compliance issues with intimidating HR actions.

Compromised Quality Assurance and Regulatory Violations

Additionally, Guerrero and Xie contend that Faraday Future failed to conduct essential pre-delivery checks on certain vehicles prior to completing sales contracts. Further still, the plaintiffs argue that the company sent ""non-road approved"" software updates to select clients and neglected appropriate reporting mechanisms vis-à-vis the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, thereby flouting critical safety regulations under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act. Finally, Guerrero alleges that post-sale repair procedures lack adequate oversight, placing the company's standing with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair in jeopardy.

Conclusion

These recent allegations paint a picture of discord and malfeasance within the upper echelons of Faraday Future, fueling doubts concerning the company's operational transparency and commitment to quality standards. With mounting legal challenges and dwindling finances, it becomes increasingly crucial for Faraday Future to address these pressing concerns and restore confidence among stakeholders, regulators, and consumers alike.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ff91-ev.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-09 20:26:51,"Uncovering Deceit: Whistleblowers Sue Faraday Future Over False Sales & Retaliation - Learn More!

Harnessing Ambient Heat: The Promise of Pyroelectrochemical Cells for Internet of Things

Researchers at the University of Utah's College of Engineering have developed a promising alternative power source for the Internet of Things (IoT) – pyroelectrochemical cells (PECs). These innovative batteries convert thermal energy into electricity and store it as electrochemical energy, making them ideal for use in environments where conventional electrical sources may be unreliable or unavailable. In contrast to traditional batteries that rely solely on chemical reactions to generate power, PECs utilize changes in temperature within their surroundings to create an electric field, driving ions and storing energy through electrochemical processes.

Composed of a pyroelectric composite material, such as porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and barium titanate nanoparticles, PECs feature unique electrical properties that respond to heat or cold exposure. As the temperature rises or falls, the polarization of the pyroelectric separator increases or decreases, respectively, allowing the cell to store electricity via an electric double-layer mechanism.

To test their theories regarding PEC operation, researchers investigated two primary factors influencing performance: the impact of orientating the separator in different directions (orientation effect) and variations between heating and cooling cycles. Experiments demonstrated that altering the separator's position drove ions in opposite directions as expected, while both warming and cooling phases resulted in predictable responses. Future efforts will focus on adapting PEC technology beyond laboratory testing and integrating it into real-world applications. One student has already begun developing circuit models aimed at designing functional cells capable of optimal performance.

Compared to photovoltaic alternatives like solar panels, PECs offer several distinct advantages. While solar cells require direct access to sunlight to produce electricity efficiently, PECs draw upon ambient heat present even during cloudy days or nighttime hours, extending their operational capabilities across diverse climates and seasons. Additionally, unlike solar panels, which typically possess limited mobility due to cumbersome installation requirements, PECs can easily integrate into existing infrastructure, providing flexible placement options tailored to specific needs. By harnessing the abundant and often untapped reservoir of waste heat generated by numerous industrial, transportation, and natural systems, PECs hold substantial promise in reshaping sustainable energy production strategies for the expanding network of interconnected IoT devices.","Title: Harnessing Ambient Heat: The Promise of Pyroelectrochemical Cells for Internet of Things

Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing various sectors by enabling wirelessly connected devices to perform a wide range of tasks, from monitoring engine conditions to remote sensing in agricultural settings. However, a significant challenge remains - how to power these devices in environments where reliable electrical sources are not readily available. A potential solution lies in a novel type of battery called a pyroelectrochemical cell (PEC), as suggested by research from the University of Utah's College of Engineering. This article explores the concept, functionality, and potential applications of PECs.

The Pyroelectrochemical Cell (PEC): A Novel Battery Solution

PECs convert thermal energy into electricity and store it as electrochemical energy, making them an attractive power source for IoT and distributed sensors. Developed and tested in the research labs of Roseanne Warren and Shad Roundy, PECs operate by changing temperatures in the surrounding environment, such as inside a car or aircraft or just under the soil in an agricultural environment. This temperature fluctuation generates an electric field inside the cell, which in turn pushes ions around and enables the cell to store energy.

PECs consist of a pyroelectric composite material, such as porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and barium titanate nanoparticles, as the separator in an electrochemical cell. The electrical properties of this material change as it's heated or cooled, decreasing or increasing the polarization of the pyroelectric separator, thereby storing electricity in an electric double layer.

Experimental Validation and Next Steps

The University of Utah engineering team conducted experiments to validate their PEC theory, focusing on the orientation effect - reversing the separator's orientation to drive ions the other way - and heating vs. cooling effects. The experiments yielded positive results, with the cell responding as predicted. The next step involves determining if PECs can function outside a lab setting. One of Warren's students is now working on circuit modeling to design a cell and optimize its function.

In the realm of IoT advancements, one major hurdle persists—power supply for devices situated in areas devoid of dependable electrical sources. An innovative answer surfaces through research led by the University of Utah's College of Engineering: pyroelectrochemical cells (PECs). These ingenious batteries transform heat into electrical energy while simultaneously storing it as electrochemical energy, offering a promising alternative for IoT and dispersed sensor networks.

A Closer Look at Pyroelectrochemical Cells (PECs)

These pioneering storage systems rely on alterations in environmental temperatures to produce electricity. For instance, vehicles, airplanes, and even subterranean agricultural setups present ample opportunities for harnessing ambient heat via PEC technology.

At the core of each PEC lies a specialized composite substance like porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) combined with barium titanate nanoparticles. Acting as a separator in an electrochemical cell, this unique compound exhibits shifting electrical characteristics when exposed to varying temperatures, generating an electric field that facilitates ion movement and energy accumulation. Consequently, these cells hold immense potential for driving IoT innovations forward.

Testing and Future Prospects

To substantiate their findings, engineers carried out comprehensive tests centered on two primary aspects: the impact of separator orientation and the distinction between heating versus cooling cycles. Preliminary outcomes indicate favorable responses aligning with theoretical predictions. Currently, researchers strive to ascertain whether PECs remain functional beyond laboratory boundaries. Notably, efforts are underway to refine cell designs using computer simulations aimed at maximizing performance efficiency.

Are you ready to witness Apple's next big leap in mobile technology? The rumors are swirling about iOS 18, and we'll find out for sure at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference in June. In the meantime, let's take a look at what we can hope for in this latest software update.

First and foremost, I'm hoping for a significant improvement in multitasking capabilities on the iPhone. While Apple has made some strides with its Dynamic Island feature, it still lags behind Android in terms of handling multiple tasks at once. Functions like multi-window and floating windows would greatly enhance the user experience on iOS 18.

As a big-screen phone user, I often find myself taking advantage of Android's multitasking features, such as running multiple apps on the same screen or using pop-up windows for calculating invoices or editing photos. With the larger real estate of the iPhone Plus and Pro Max models, it would be a shame not to take full advantage of it.

Secondly, I'd like to see Apple incorporate some of the best AI features that already exist in other smartphones. For instance, a feature similar to Google's ""Circle to Search"" would be incredibly useful for quickly searching and learning more about anything on the screen, whether it's a pair of sneakers on Instagram or unfamiliar Twitter/X lingo.

Additionally, I'd love to see Apple bring its AI capabilities to the Photos app, allowing users to edit out distracting objects and photobombers from images with ease. This would be especially useful for frequent travelers, as a live translation feature could be incorporated to translate text and audio in another language on-the-fly.

Finally, I'd like to see a significant improvement in Siri's capabilities. While Siri is available on millions of iPhones worldwide, it still lags behind Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa in terms of functionality. Apple is reportedly working on making Siri more conversational and intelligent with the use of large-language models, which could make it easier to converse with the voice assistant and have it answer questions in a more natural way.

Lastly, better notification management would be a welcome addition to iOS 18. The current notification system on iOS can be disorganized and frustrating to use, with irrelevant notifications cluttering up the notification tray. Improving notification management would make it easier to prioritize and respond to important messages.

Overall, I'm excited to see what iOS 18 has in store for us, and I hope Apple takes heed of these suggestions to make the software even more user-friendly and intuitive.

This revised SEO title encapsulates the main theme of the article - Tesla's change in strategy away from creating an inexpensive EV - while keeping it concise and engaging for search engines.","

Tesla's Strategic Shift: A Leap of Faith or a Misstep?

In a bold move that diverges from the anticipated path, Elon Musk has shifted Tesla's focus from developing an affordable electric vehicle (EV) to prioritizing the creation of a robotaxi. This decision could redefine the company's trajectory and either cement its position as an industry leader or jeopardize its hard-earned lead.

The Promise of an Affordable EV

Tesla's journey towards producing a $25,000 EV seemed to be on the horizon, with plans to commence construction of a new vehicle at the Texas plant in the latter half of 2025. This initiative promised to expand Tesla's market reach by offering a competitively priced alternative to the average $47,000 car in the U.S. market. Moreover, it positioned Tesla to compete against the influx of cost-effective Chinese EVs.

The Robotaxi Gamble

However, Musk's fascination with a robotaxi—a concept he believes could generate up to $30,000 annually for its owners—has taken precedence. Despite the allure of this vision, Tesla's current technological capabilities fall short of achieving a fully autonomous Level 5 vehicle. The existing Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems still require human oversight, and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have yet to bridge this gap.

The Implications for Tesla

The shift towards robotaxi development is not without its challenges. It entails constructing a new production line, reminiscent of the arduous experience with the Model 3. Furthermore, Musk's penchant for exploratory projects raises questions about the most effective strategy for Tesla. Should a specialized division within the company take the reins, or is an external spin-off more viable?

The Role of Tesla's Board

Tesla's board, closely aligned with Musk's vision, plays a crucial role in this strategic pivot. Their consensus with Musk's decisions has been a defining characteristic, but as Tesla transitions from a daring startup to a manufacturing powerhouse, the stakes are higher than ever.

Conclusion: A Future Defined by Choices

Tesla stands at a crossroads, with its future hinging on the outcomes of its strategic decisions. The company's success has been built on taking calculated risks, but as it matures, the balance between innovation and practicality becomes increasingly vital. Will the robotaxi venture propel Tesla to new heights, or will it be a detour from its mission of mass-market EV accessibility? Only time will tell.

Introduction

Lithium-ion batteries have become indispensable components in our daily lives, powering everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. Despite their widespread use, these batteries suffer from gradual capacity fade over numerous charge cycles. Conventional charging methods using constant current may not be optimal for maximizing battery lifetimes. An intriguing solution comes in the form of a recent study led by Professor Philipp Adelhelm and his team, demonstrating how high-frequency pulsed current charging can minimize aging effects and double the cycle life of commercial lithium-ion batteries. Let's delve deeper into the fascinating world of advanced battery technologies and explore the potential benefits of adopting novel charging strategies.

Understanding Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation

Before diving into the innovative pulsed charging approach, let us first understand why traditional lithium-ion batteries deteriorate over time. As batteries undergo repeated charge and discharge cycles, undesirable side reactions occur, leading to various forms of degradation. One such phenomenon is the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), primarily composed of lithium carbonates and other reduction products, at the negative electrode surface. Although necessary for proper battery function, excessive growth of the SEI layer hinders ion transport, thereby reducing overall battery performance. Additionally, continuous cycling induces mechanical stress and results in particle fracture within both the graphitic anode and nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode materials. These combined factors contribute to the eventual decline in battery capacity and lifespan.

High-Frequency Pulsed Current Charging: A Game Changer

In a quest to mitigate the detrimental impacts of conventional charging techniques, researchers investigated a novel pulsed current (PC) strategy. By applying short bursts of high current followed by brief periods of rest, this technique aims to promote uniform lithium diffusion throughout the anode matrix, reduce mechanical stress buildup, and limit undesired side reactions. To evaluate its effectiveness, two sets of batteries comprising NMC532 cathodes and graphite anodes were assembled – one set subjected to constant current (CC) charging and the other to high-frequency PC charging. Following multiple charge cycles, post-mortem analyses revealed striking disparities. Notably, the SEI layers in the PC-charged batteries remained considerably thinner than those in the CC counterparts, ultimately preserving greater active material availability for charge transfer. Furthermore, the PC charging substantially diminished crack propagation within both the NMC532 cathode and graphite anode structures, contributing to enhanced structural integrity and durability.

Operando Characterization Reveals Key Insights

To shed light on the underlying mechanisms governing the observed improvements, researchers conducted comprehensive operando characterizations utilizing advanced analytical tools such as Raman spectroscopy, dilatometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Operando measurements allow scientists to monitor real-time physiochemical transformations occurring inside working batteries, providing valuable insights into the inner workings of these complex systems. Data obtained from these investigations indicated that pulsed current charging facilitated homogenous lithium incorporation into the graphite anode lattice, effectively minimizing mechanical strain accumulation and subsequent particle fragmentation. Moreover, PC charging suppressed unfavorable structural transitions in NMC532 cathode materials, further bolstering battery resilience against fatigue.

Optimizing Pulsed Frequencies for Maximum Benefits

While high-frequency PC charging offers promising avenues for enhancing lithium-ion battery longevity, fine-tuning the pulse frequencies remains essential for eliciting optimal performance gains. Specifically, experimental evidence suggests that employing high-frequency square-wave current pulses yields the greatest enhancement in cycle life, achieving an impressive 80% capacity retention even after twice the number of charge cycles compared to conventional methods. Such findings underscore the critical role of optimized pulse parameters in realizing substantial advancements in battery endurance and reliability.

Conclusion

As society continues to embrace portable electronics and zero-emission transportation, developing robust, long-lasting energy storage solutions becomes increasingly vital. The groundbreaking study discussed herein highlights the untapped potential of alternative charging paradigms, showcasing the merits of high-frequency pulsed current approaches in extending battery lifetimes.
