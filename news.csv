https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/multiverse-the-apprenticeship-unicorn-acquires-searchlight-to-put-a-focus-on-ai/,"Multiverse, the apprenticeship unicorn, acquires Searchlight to put a focus on AI", Multiverse Acquires Searchlight for AI-Powered Recruitment in EdTech ,"Multiverse, a UK unicorn that specializes in building apprenticeship programs for people to learn technology skills while on the job, has announced that it has acquired Searchlight, a startup that develops AI-based recruitment and assessment products. The acquisition is expected to help Multiverse expand its training services for professional environments by utilizing Searchlight's technology and team.
Searchlight was founded by twin sisters Kerry and Anna Wang, who will become director of product and head of AI at Multiverse, respectively. Searchlight's existing customers include Udemy, Zapier, Talkdesk, and other tech companies, and they will be served until the end of their contracts. After that, Multiverse will wind down Searchlight's recruitment services to focus on its own business.
The acquisition highlights the increasing importance that AI is playing in startups straddling the worlds of work and education. While some people use AI to speed up what they do, others claim that AI is taking over certain jobs altogether. This acquisition addresses another area where AI is being employed: edtech companies focused on working environments want to use AI to build more efficient professional training services to fill recruitment gaps.
The use of AI in recruitment has been met with controversy before, particularly when it comes to bias. In 2018, Amazon had to scrap an AI recruitment tool after it was found to be biased against women for technical roles, due to being trained on typical recruitment data that was more commonly sourced from men. However, technology and awareness around how models are being built and trained have come a long way since then, according to Searchlight's CEO.
Searchlight's AI model is able to identify a good match for a role four times greater than a traditional interview, and the company claims that it was one of the first organizations in the world to independently audit its own AI models to ensure that the talent recommendations that it gave were without bias.
There are many questions when it comes to the role of AI in learning, and whether some of its impact is more harmful than good. For example, there are concerns that students might use generative AI to write essays or take tests, which could make it harder to understand what students are really learning. However, in supplemental training environments, AI can help personalize learning to an individual's needs at scale, and it can be more engaging and dynamic than more traditional learning.
Multiverse, which was founded and led by Blair, currently has around 1,000 customers, including Cisco, government organizations, financial services, and industrial companies. While the company first made its name with a focus on apprenticeships as a viable alternative for people looking to build careers in fast-moving fields like technology, it has since expanded to cover professional training for people already employed.
Multiverse has some AI-based services live now, including a personalized AI assistant coach for users. Now, the company wants to keep layering in more technology to improve the overall platform and its credibility with customers intent on buying and using more modern services.
Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but for some context, the Wang sisters raised nearly $20 million, primarily via a 2021 fundraise when they raised a $17 million Series A. The company's valuation was estimated at $64 million in 2021, and Multiverse has been on a fundraising tear over the last several years, raising several hundred million dollars from investors that include General Catalyst and Lightspeed.
This is the company's second acquisition, and it is expected to help Multiverse expand its training services for professional environments. The acquisition is a significant move for both companies, and it highlights the growing importance of AI in both the work and education sectors.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Searchlight-Founders.jpg?resize=1200,672",2024-04-08 23:46:46,"""Discover how AI-Training revolutionizes professional development!

The Power of Muscles in Robotics

Muscles are remarkable devices, offering more power and precision per unit weight than most synthetic actuators. Furthermore, they possess the unique ability to heal from damage and grow stronger with exercise. Engineers have already demonstrated a variety of ""biohybrid"" robots that leverage muscle-based actuators to power artificial skeletons for walking, swimming, pumping, and gripping. However, each bot has its distinct build, and there is no universal blueprint for optimizing muscles for various robot designs.

Introducing the Adjustable Flexure

MIT engineers have designed a new spring-like device, or ""flexure,"" which can be used as a basic skeleton-like module for almost any muscle-bound bot. The flexure is designed to maximize the work output of any attached muscle tissues, stretching them five times more than previous designs. The researchers discovered that, when fitted with a ring of muscle tissue, the muscle pulled on the spring reliably and repeatedly, resulting in enhanced movement.

The flexure design can be combined with other flexures to create any configuration of artificial skeletons, which can then be equipped with muscle tissues to power their movements. According to Ritu Raman, the Brit and Alex d'Arbeloff Career Development Professor in Engineering Design at MIT, ""These flexures are like a skeleton that people can now use to turn muscle actuation into multiple degrees of freedom of motion in a very predictable way... We are giving roboticists a new set of rules to make powerful and precise muscle-powered robots that do interesting things.""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm, with tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E gaining massive popularity. This frenzy, however, has attracted cybercriminals looking to exploit users' curiosity about AI. According to Bitdefender, scammers are using the allure of AI features and services to trick Facebook users into downloading malicious software. Here's a closer look at these scams and how to avoid them.

The Scam Ecosystem

Scammers have been hijacking Facebook Pages and disguising them as legitimate AI services, such as OpenAI's video creation tool Sora and its image creation tool DALL-E. They then run ads on Facebook's network, luring users with the prospect of early access to experimental AI research and products. Once users follow these Pages, scammers post AI-generated content to make the Page appear authentic.

Next, they inform the Page's followers that they need to download software to access the experimental AI services. In reality, this software is malware, including Rilide, Vidar, IceRAT, and Nova, which steals users' data.

The Midjourney AI Scam

One prominent example of this scam was the Midjourney AI Facebook Page, which amassed 1.2 million followers before Facebook removed it in March 2024 for violating policies. Despite its removal, other similar Pages emerged, making it a game of virtual Whac-A-Mole.

Users who downloaded software from these Pages encountered several red flags. They were directed to Google Drive or Dropbox links, and closer inspection revealed that the Pages were not directly associated with the companies they represented.

Staying Safe from AI-Themed Scams

To avoid falling victim to these scams, it's essential to remain vigilant and informed. Legitimate tech companies do not use Facebook Pages to offer access to experimental features. Additionally, they will never share third-party links for downloading their software. To stay safe, follow these guidelines:

1. Stay informed about AI trends and be cautious of suspicious Pages or ads promoting early access to AI tools.

Introduction

Have you ever wondered how the prompts you use when interacting with large language models (LLMs) affect the responses you receive? As it turns out, even minor alterations in prompts can significantly influence LLM predictions. A study conducted by researchers at the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) delved into this question and discovered that variations in prompts can have a substantial impact on LLM outputs. Let's explore their findings and the implications for using LLMs in data processing tasks.

The Study

The researchers, Abel Salinas and Fred Morstatter, investigated four categories of prompt variations:

1. Requesting responses in specific output formats (lists, CSV, etc.)
2. Minor perturbations to the prompt, such as adding extra spaces or incorporating polite phrases
3. Using ""jailbreaks"" to bypass content filters
4. Offering tips for ""a perfect response""

They tested these variations across 11 benchmark text classification tasks and measured the impact on LLM accuracy and the frequency of response changes.

Key Findings

The researchers found that even minor alterations in prompt structure and presentation could substantially affect LLM predictions. Specifically:

1. Specified output formats: Adding a specified output format led to a minimum of 10% of predictions changing.
2. Prompt perturbations: Introducing spaces, common greetings, or ending with ""Thank you"" resulted in more than 500 (out of 11,000) prediction changes.
3. Jailbreaks: Using jailbreaks on the tasks led to a larger proportion of changes but was highly dependent on which jailbreak was used.
4. No single formatting or perturbation method suited all tasks, and the ""No Specified Format"" achieved the highest overall accuracy.
5. Offering tips had minimal impact on performance, but certain jailbreaks resulted in significant accuracy loss.

Implications

These findings highlight the importance of understanding how prompt variations can influence LLM predictions. When developing or using LLMs for data processing tasks, consider the following:

1. Be cautious when specifying output formats, as they can impact model performance.
2.

Introduction

Imagine a world where robots can effortlessly scale tall structures, completing maintenance tasks or delivering essential supplies to previously inaccessible locations. This vision is closer to reality than you might think, thanks to the development of climbing robots. However, for these robots to be successfully deployed in real-world scenarios, they must accurately sense and map their surroundings while predicting their location within these environments.

A recent study published in Robotics and Autonomous Systems presents a novel solution to enhance the ability of a bipedal climbing robot (BiCR) to estimate its state and map its surroundings while climbing a truss structure. The proposed method, developed by researchers at Guangdong University of Technology, is based on a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, specifically adapted to the BiCR.

The SLAM Concept and BiCR

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a technique that enables a robot to build a map of its environment while concurrently determining its location within that map. In this study, the researchers applied SLAM methods to a particular bipedal climbing robot, BiCR, developed by the Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab.

BiCR is an electromechanical system that moves via grippers at both ends and rotates with multiple joints. This robot can be used for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and high-risk environments, such as construction site scaffolding and power towers. The primary objective of the study was to allow the BiCR to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures.

BiCR-SLAM: A Customized SLAM System

The researchers developed BiCR-SLAM, a SLAM system specifically designed for the BiCR robot. This system uses information about the BiCR robot's configuration, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras to localize the robot and map the truss it is climbing.

The BiCR-SLAM framework consists of four components: encoder dead reckoning, LiDAR odometry estimation, pole landmark mapping, and global optimization. The encoder dead reckoning provides an initial estimate of the robot's position, while the Li",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-fusion-slam-system-t-1.jpg,2024-04-08 07:50:01,"Meta Description:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/neurovalens-anxiety-fda/,Neurotech startup Neurovalens gets FDA clearance for noninvasive anxiety treatment," FDA Clears Neurovalens' Noninvasive Devices for Anxiety, Insomnia Treatment ","Neurovalens, a Belfast-based startup that specializes in noninvasive electrical stimulation of the brain and nervous system, has just had two of its medical devices cleared by the FDA. These devices, which have been approved for prescription by doctors in the U.S., treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and insomnia. The GAD device was approved just last week, and the device for insomnia received FDA clearance last October. More products are on the way, including a device for treating obesity-related cardiometabolic risk, which targets brain messaging that can influence the storage of harmful visceral fat. The company plans to apply for an FDA de novo classification for a third noninvasive neurostimulating device for people diagnosed with obesity later this year or early next year.

Neurovalens' approach to treating medical conditions through noninvasive neurostimulation is gaining traction as traditional healthcare services struggle to handle issues like chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and stress. Pharmaceutical interventions have their drawbacks, including potential side effects, so noninvasive alternatives that demonstrate efficacy and safety could be transformative.

To differentiate itself from other startups in the field, Neurovalens has chosen to focus on selling regulator-cleared medical devices for specific conditions. This requires it to conduct clinical trials to demonstrate significant results for particular use cases, rather than going direct to consumers with a marketing pitch composed of fuzzier “wellness” promises. By doing so, it can make medical claims for its products, which it can't do as a consumer device.

The clinical trials that Neurovalens had to go through to get the first two approvals were more stringent than the typical 510(k) process. The FDA required Neurovalens to conduct its own trials, rather than relying on existing data, to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of its products.

Currently, consumers in Europe can purchase Neurovalens' products directly, but the company is applying for medical device clearances in the U.K. and EU. It expects to get its first stamp of approval for doctors in Europe to prescribe its insomnia device as a treatment later this year.

Neurovalens' products take the form of a head-mounted device that applies electrical neurostimulation to the skin behind the ear, directly targeting the vestibular nerve. This is a distinct approach from other neurostimulation startups, such as those applying transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) or magnetic stimulation.

The basic theory behind Neurovalens' mechanism is that targeted stimulation can re-regulate the brain's control centers when areas are not functioning normally. Effects can be lasting, with users able to stop regular treatment after noticing positive change and switch to top-up treatments.

In conclusion, Neurovalens' success in obtaining FDA clearance for its medical devices targeting specific medical conditions is a testament to the growing potential of noninvasive neurostimulation. As the field becomes more mature, there is the potential for these devices to be used in conjunction with pharmaceutical interventions to dial up interventions. With more products on the way, Neurovalens is positioned to continue its journey towards transforming the healthcare industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-08-at-19.17.32.png?resize=1200,1061",2024-04-08 17:28:35,"""Discover noninvasive neurostimulation!

The worlds of music and technology have always been intertwined, with each influencing the other's evolution. In recent times, the music industry has had to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape, and the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is no exception. However, this new era of music creation brings with it a unique set of challenges and opportunities.

One of the key issues facing companies that wish to utilize AI ethically is the training data conundrum. Paul McCabe, Vice President of R&D at Roland, highlighted the difficulty in ensuring responsible and equitable use of training data, especially when competing with applications built on scraped online data. This raises concerns about the ethical use of AI in music creation and the importance of updating copyright laws to accommodate this new technology.

However, the focus should be on enabling music and GenAI to co-exist harmoniously. Music technology has historically not replaced human musicians; instead, it has expanded their creative possibilities. For instance, drum machines did not diminish the appeal of live drumming, and music sampling, once a contentious issue, is now a widely accepted method of creating new sounds.

GenAI has the potential to revolutionize music creation and accessibility. Songwriters are no longer limited by their instrumental skills or recording knowledge, while beginners can learn new instruments more easily with natural language processing and conversational prompts. However, this new technology must be adopted responsibly.

Roland, in partnership with Universal Music Group, has taken a significant step towards responsible AI use in music creation. They have released ""Principles for Music Creation with AI,"" which includes seven core principles, such as the belief that AI will amplify human creativity and the importance of transparency in establishing trustworthy AI.

These principles emphasize the need for authorization and compensation when using copyrighted works, artists' names, images, and voices. AI-powered platforms and policies should prioritize record-keeping and disclosure to maintain trust among all stakeholders, including fans and artists.

Adopting these principles is voluntary, with more than 60 global companies, including music labels, recording studios, and academia, expressing interest in supporting the cause.

Introduction

Green hydrogen, a promising future clean energy carrier, is increasingly becoming a topic of interest. Among the various renewable energy sources available, solar energy has a unique advantage: it's abundant and almost universally accessible, with minimal dependence on natural topography. However, solar energy output and generation can be inconsistent due to factors like seasonal and weather variations, leading to repetitive increases and decreases in power that can potentially damage the components of production devices. This highlights the need for precise evaluation of the durability of devices under power fluctuations, which can help determine the optimal timing for component replacement and the development of new materials.

A research team from the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), led by Director Yoon Seok-jin, has made significant strides in this area. They have developed a durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices using actual solar irradiance data with step durations as short as one second. This represents the shortest step duration among developed techniques, enabling the most accurate simulation of fluctuations in actual solar energy output.

The Challenge of Existing Evaluation Methods

Existing durability evaluation methods have not accurately reflected solar output variability, often relying solely on simple methods such as periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Moreover, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions.

The KIST Research Team's Innovation

The KIST research team has developed a simulation method that converts irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data obtained from solar panels and water electrolysis stack data. This has dramatically shortened the step duration from 10 seconds to 1 second, allowing fluctuations in solar output to be accurately reflected.

The team has also proposed key indicators for the material development of green hydrogen production devices. Standardized analysis methods for assessing performance degradation of materials such as catalysts and electrolyte membranes, as well as indicators of performance degradation such as catalyst leaching amount, fluoride release rate, and thickness of passivation layer have been proposed. These guidelines can be utilized for the development of",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/development-of-durabil.jpg,2024-04-08 09:25:03, KIST's innovative 1-sec solar irradiance method , durable solar-powered green hydrogen production devices ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Drones have become increasingly popular in various industries, from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions. However, one significant limitation of drones is their battery life. Even commercial models that can stay airborne for 45 minutes or more on a single charge could benefit from extended flight times. Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark have been tackling this challenge by developing drones capable of recharging directly from power lines.

In a groundbreaking experiment, a Tarot 650 Sport drone, equipped with a customized electric quadcopter propulsion system, autopilot module, and other components, successfully inspected and charged from power lines for five cycles over two hours. This achievement marks a significant milestone in drone technology and has the potential to revolutionize the way drones are used for various applications.

The drone's system detects low battery levels and activates its camera and millimeter-wave radar system to locate the nearest power line. It then approaches the power line from below, using inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into the gripper. An inductive charger pulls current from the power line, recharging the battery. Once full, the gripper releases the cable, and the drone resumes its mission.

Initially, the researchers envisioned this technology for drones that inspect power lines. The team first demonstrated a self-charging drone recharging from power lines in 2022. In their latest experiment, they improved the gripper system and showcased a practical use case for this technology. In a paper presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the team described the project as ""a first-in-the-world system with the ability to sustain operation throughout many inspection/charging cycles powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment."" The drone's most successful test involved staying aloft for over two hours through five cycles of power line inspection and charging.

Several advantages come with drones that can charge directly from power lines. First, it significantly extends the drone's flight time, allowing for more extended missions and increased efficiency. Second, it reduces the need for human intervention, as drones can now return to their charging stations independently.
