https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/e2ee-police-chiefs-lawful-access/,European police chiefs target E2EE in latest demand for 'lawful access', European Police: Reevaluate E2EE for Child Safety; Debate on CSAM Detection ,"THE CONTINUING CRYPTO WARS: A CALL TO RECONSIDER END-TO-END ENCRYPTION

In the ongoing battle known as the crypto wars, Graeme Biggar, the director general of the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), has urged Meta (formerly Facebook) to reconsider its implementation of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Instagram. This call follows a joint declaration by European police chiefs, including the UK’s, expressing concern over the expanding use of E2EE by the tech industry and its potential impact on law enforcement’s ability to identify and act upon illegal activities.

A Threat to Child Safety?

The NCA chief argues that Meta’s plan to roll out E2EE on Instagram, which would ensure that only the message’s sender and recipient can access the content, could pose a threat to child safety. Currently, platforms can scan messages that aren’t encrypted, resulting in tens of millions of child-safety related reports being sent to police forces worldwide. Biggar claims that these reports lead to the safeguarding of 1,200 children and the arrest of 800 people monthly. A shift to E2EE could potentially halt this flow of information, making it more difficult for law enforcement to protect the public from organized and serious crime.

Striking a Balance

While the NCA supports strong encryption as a means to protect users from cybercrime, Biggar emphasizes the need for tech companies to find a way to provide law enforcement with necessary information without compromising user privacy. This sentiment is echoed in the joint declaration by European police chiefs, who call on the technology industry to adopt unspecified “technical solutions” that can offer users robust security and privacy while maintaining the ability to spot illegal activity and report it to law enforcement.

One such potential solution is client-side scanning, which Apple planned to implement in 2021 to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on users’ devices. However, this approach has been met with criticism from privacy and legal experts, who argue that it poses a threat to democratic freedoms and could wreak havoc on cybersecurity.

A Revised Approach to CSAM Detection

The European Council adopted a resolution in December 2020, mandating lawful access to","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1182226451.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-22 12:06:00,"Securely Detect Child Safety Material: Balance Privacy and Public Safety with End-to-End Encryption. Amid crypto wars, tech firms and law enforcement seek CSAM detection methods preserving user privacy. Encryption ChildSafety SEO

The challenge lies in finding a balance between user privacy and public safety as the crypto wars continue. With end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Instagram, Meta faces pressure from European police chiefs, including the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), to reconsider its implementation. E2EE may hinder child safety efforts, as messages can't be scanned for illegal activities, potentially impacting law enforcement's ability to protect the public.

Striking a balance, tech companies and law enforcement need to work together to provide necessary information for law enforcement without compromising user privacy. One proposed solution, client-side scanning, has faced criticism from privacy and legal experts.

A revised approach to CSAM detection is essential. The European Council adopted a resolution in December 2020, mandating lawful access to encrypted data for the purpose of detecting and preventing criminal activities. A ""hash bank"" storing known CSAM signatures could enable secure and efficient comparison without the need for client-side scanning or breaking end-to-end encryption.

As the debate on end-to-end encryption continues, striking a balance between privacy and public safety remains crucial for shaping the future of the digital landscape.

Introduction

Raising young children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) can be a daunting task. The challenges of getting a timely diagnosis and affordable treatment are all too familiar for many parents. With a nationwide shortage of psychologists, the wait times for a diagnosis and therapy can stretch up to nearly a year, and the costs can reach thousands of dollars annually for out-of-network care. Enter Clarity Pediatrics, a chronic care startup that aims to streamline the ADHD diagnosis and therapy process for young kids and their families.

A New Approach to ADHD Therapy

Founded in 2021, Clarity Pediatrics offers an innovative solution to the long-standing problem of limited access to pediatric mental health services. Instead of traditional one-on-one therapy sessions for children, the startup hosts eight-week group therapy sessions for parents of children with ADHD. This approach, known as Behavioral Parent Training (BPT), is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics for families with children aged five to 12 who have mild-to-moderate ADHD.

BPT focuses on teaching parents strategies and skills to help their children improve focus in school, manage emotional outbursts, and build critical life skills. Research indicates that this method can be just as effective, if not more so, than individual therapy for young children with ADHD.

Clarity Pediatrics' Impact and Expansion

Over the past 18 months, Clarity Pediatrics has provided online care to thousands of families in California. They are poised to expand their services to other states in 2024, utilizing $10 million in seed funds from Rethink Impact, Homebrew, and Maverick Ventures. The company's unique approach to ADHD care has also attracted investments from January Ventures, Vamos Ventures, Alumni Ventures, and City Light VC.

The Need for Innovative Pediatric Mental Health Solutions

Unfortunately, the medical system is not equipped with enough specialists to address this growing need.

The European Union (EU) has opened a second formal investigation into TikTok, suspecting the popular video-sharing platform of violating the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA). This move follows concerns about potential mental health risks associated with the newly launched TikTok Lite app. The investigation will focus on TikTok's compliance with DSA obligations, specifically regarding the ""Task and Reward Lite"" feature, which could encourage addictive behavior among young users.

EU Cracks Down on TikTok's Product Launch

On April 18, 2023, the EU announced its decision to investigate TikTok Lite, a version of the video-sharing platform that offers users the ability to earn points for watching or liking videos. These points can be exchanged for rewards such as Amazon gift vouchers or TikTok's digital currency. The Commission is concerned that this feature may negatively impact users' mental health, particularly minors, by stimulating addictive behavior.

TikTok Fails to Provide Risk Assessment Document

The EU has requested that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, submit a risk assessment report on the ""Task and Reward Lite"" feature before its launch. However, ByteDance failed to produce the document within the given 24-hour deadline. This failure to comply with the DSA has led the Commission to suspect a ""prima facie infringement of the DSA."" Penalties for confirmed violations of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover, potentially leading to hefty fines for ByteDance.

TikTok Regulated Under Strict Regime of the DSA

As one of the larger platforms regulated under the DSA, TikTok is subject to an extra layer of risk mitigation requirements. These requirements oblige the company to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks, such as addictive design that could harm users' mental health. The EU suspects ByteDance failed to do this before launching TikTok Lite in France and Spain.

Smaller Fines for Failures to Produce Requested Information

Introduction

Smartphone manufacturers and mobile carriers often join forces, offering deals that seem too good to be true. These partnerships, however, are not always what they seem. Sifting through the complexities of these deals can be daunting, leaving you questioning whether you've hit the jackpot or fallen into a financial trap. In this post, we'll explore how to separate fact from fiction and find the best deal for you.

The Fine Print: Understanding Hidden Costs

Often, attractive smartphone deals come with strings attached in the form of hidden costs. These hidden charges are usually tied to the service plan you must select to qualify for the full discount. Monthly payments may appear low, but the actual cost of the plan, including wireless service and additional fees, can skyrocket.

Comparing Deals: A Practical Example

Let's consider a real-world example: upgrading from an iPhone 12 Pro Max to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 15 Pro Max, with 512 GB of storage, retails for $1,399. Apple offers a trade-in value of $370, bringing the price down to $1,029 after trade-in and before sales tax. Financing the phone over 24 months at 0% interest results in a monthly payment of $42.87.

Mobile carriers, such as Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, also offer deals when purchasing from Apple's website. However, these seemingly fantastic deals may not always provide the most savings.

The Winning Deal: T-Mobile

In this example, T-Mobile offers the best deal, with Apple coming in a close second. Switching to AT&T or Verizon would result in paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than buying the phone directly from Apple and sticking with the original plan. The key to uncovering this is to carefully read the deal details and perform the necessary calculations.

Introduction

Venture capital activity in Africa has demonstrated resilience over the past six months, with major firms on the continent closing their funds despite the global funding winter. TLcom Capital, an African VC firm with offices in Lagos and Nairobi, recently concluded fundraising for its second fund, TIDE Africa Fund II, totaling $154 million, making it Africa's largest investor across seed and Series A.

TLcom Capital's TIDE Africa Fund II

TLcom Capital's TIDE Africa Fund II, an oversubscribed fund initially targeted at $150 million, attracted participation from over 20 limited partners. Notable investors include the European Investment Bank (EIB), Visa Foundation, Bertelsmann, and AfricaGrow, a joint venture between Allianz and DEG Impact. The final close, concluded in a shorter timeframe than its preceding fund and despite being twice its size, highlights an improved understanding and acceptance of venture capital in Africa among limited partners.

Investment Strategy and Portfolio

Unlike many VC firms that progress from backing startups in pre-seed and seed stages to later-stage investments with subsequent funds, TLcom maintains a consistent strategy. The firm focuses on traditional sectors like fintech, mobility, agriculture, healthcare, education, and commerce, prioritizing early-stage opportunities, particularly at the seed and Series A stages.

TLcom has backed 10 out of the 11 companies from its first fund at the seed or Series A stages. It has deployed capital in follow-on rounds at later stages across both funds, including a Series C investment in Andela, a unicorn provider of global job placement for software developers, and partaking in a Series B extension round in FairMoney, a Nigerian digital bank.

""We like to start early when the entrepreneur is raising seed or Series A and then to be with the entrepreneur along the journey and continue to invest if we think that the company deserves more capital,"" said Maurizio Caio, managing partner of TLcom Capital.

Introduction

In the age of high-tech camera phones, where picture-taking is as easy as a click of a button, one developer is taking a step back in time to bring back the charm of old-school photography. Alex Fox, the creative mind behind Mood.camera, has designed an iPhone app that captures the nostalgia of retro filters and the excitement of not knowing how your photo will turn out until it ""develops.""

The App

Mood.camera is a simple yet intriguing app that allows users to take photos using different retro filters. The user interface is reminiscent of old-school cameras, with a dial to adjust quality and tone, and easy access to switch between lenses and adjust exposure. However, the app lacks a live preview feature, which sets it apart from other camera apps.

The Developer's Vision

Fox's goal with Mood.camera is to encourage users to focus on the image in the viewfinder rather than the effects. By not including a live preview or editing feature, he hopes to urge users to be in the moment instead of worrying about which filter to use or staring at their phone editing. Fox believes that modern photography has become too focused on convenience and control, causing us to lose some of the magic along the way.

Beta Testing and Release

Fox started working on a prototype of the app in October 2023 and released a beta version on Reddit earlier this year. Over the last two months, a group of photographers helped him hone the app by taking more than 100,000 photos. The app is free to try for seven days, and then users can choose to pay either $1.99 per month or a one-time fee of $14.99.

Comparing to Other Apps

In recent years, apps like Lapse, Dispo, and Later Cam have attempted to recreate parts of retro cameras by placing limitations on the app's functions. While Lapse and Dispo have attracted investors, their growth has eventually slowed down. As an indie developer, Fox may not encounter a venture-backed outcome, but Mood.camera could potentially turn into a sustainable income and long-term success.
