Astranis is proud to announce the launch of a new generation of communications satellites named Omega. The satellites will serve broadband to customers on Earth from geostationary orbit, but faster and smaller than any comsat up there. Astranis believes the future of orbital communications is not just in higher orbits, but in the possibility of customers — government and commercial — having their very own private satellite network.

The Omega class of satellites will each provide some 50 gigabits per second of bandwidth in both civilian and military Ka bands — making it clear from the outset that this is intended to be a dual-use technology. Astranis builds and operates relatively small broadband satellites in high orbits, and sells that capacity on to telecom and internet service providers. The company has contracts to provide capacity to providers in Mexico, the Philippines, Alaska, and southeast Asia.

The startup takes pride in the comparatively diminutive size of its GEO satellites, which are normally huge and, as a result, easy to track and potentially attack. John Gedmark, CEO of Astranis, said at an event at Space Symposium, ""We need to move to a more resilient architecture. No more big, fat, juicy targets!""

The improved bandwidth is thanks to a next-gen Astranis software-defined radio, but the signal is deployed more efficiently; while the previous generation sent down a set of coherent beams, like spotlights, the new generation is more like a big LED array, providing even signal across a much greater area. Gedmark said that although the number of points that can be served depends on the customer and use case, it is theoretically in the millions. The satellites use existing Ka-band receivers rather than a bespoke antenna like Starlink’s.

When asked about how the orbital communications market would develop in the near term, Gedmark was highly optimistic. He said that the appetite for bandwidth is effectively unlimited, at least at the prices they are able to offer, which are well below legacy GEO data connections. Notably, Astranis said the satellite will support specific waveforms that are of interest to the DOD, like the Protected Tactical Waveform, so it can still provide capacity even in contested environments.

Astranis’ proposal — many small satellites in GEO — is a far cry from legacy tech, which has generally relied on very large, and very expensive, non-maneuverable satellites in GEO. In other words, sitting ducks for adversaries. Like the company’s current satellites, Omega will have the ability to maneuver in GEO using on-board all-electric propulsion. Astranis said the more efficient thrust will allow it to keep its station for at least 10 years, as well as perform plenty of repositioning and other maneuvers. By that time, the next generation will probably be ready to slot into place.

What will perhaps be Astranis’ standout product, however, will be dedicated satellites for customers. The company plans to offer ""satellite as a service"" instead, where for an upfront and monthly fee, a satellite can be tasked completely or in part to the use of a single customer. Gedmark declined to name any of the companies that had expressed interest or were being wooed in other ways, but he did suggest that energy and oil and gas companies are an obvious one, with holdings across large geographical areas and demand for a good deal of secure satellite data. He also said that, while there are no official plans as yet to approach the cislunar market, there is a huge opportunity there for future growth.

The company aims to complete the first Omega satellite in 2025 and launch to orbit in 2026. The plan is to launch on the order of six satellites at that time, with as many as 24 per year being launched after that depending on how manufacturing scales up.

Astranis’ new Omega satellite is set to revolutionize the way we communicate with each other from space. With its improved bandwidth, efficient signal deployment, and ability to maneuver in GEO, this small but mighty satellite is set to take on the big, fat, juicy targets of the past.

Optimized Title: Breakthrough! Bend THz Waves Around Barriers for Advanced Data Networks","Title: Revolutionizing Wireless Communication: Curving Terahertz Signals Around Obstacles

Introduction

As we rely more and more on cellular networks and Wi-Fi systems, it becomes increasingly clear that these systems are quickly reaching their bandwidth limits. To address this issue, scientists are looking to transition to higher communication frequencies, specifically terahertz waves, which have significantly higher data-carrying capacity than microwaves. However, terahertz signals can be easily blocked by solid objects, posing a major obstacle for direct line-of-sight communication.

A recent study by researchers from Brown University and Rice University has tackled this challenge by curving light to create terahertz signals that follow a curved trajectory around obstacles instead of being blocked by them. This novel method brings us one step closer to realizing wireless data networks running on terahertz frequencies.

The Challenge of Terahertz Communication

Current systems use microwave radiation to carry data, but it is widely accepted that terahertz waves will be the future standard for data transmission, given their higher data-carrying capacity. The main challenge is that terahertz signals can be easily blocked by solid objects, unlike microwaves. This makes a direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver a necessity, which can be problematic in many situations.

To overcome this hurdle, the researchers focused on creating a terahertz signal that follows a curved trajectory around an obstacle rather than being blocked by it.

Self-Accelerating Beams and Terahertz Communication

The researchers introduced the concept of self-accelerating beams, which are special configurations of electromagnetic waves that naturally bend or curve to one side as they move through space. They have been studied at optical frequencies but were now explored for terahertz communication. By carefully designing the patterns of transmitters, the researchers were able to manipulate the strength, intensity, and timing of the electromagnetic waves produced.

This allowed them to make the waves work together more effectively, maintaining the signal when a solid object blocks a portion of the beam. Essentially, the light beam adjusts to the blockage by shuffling data along the patterns the researchers engineered into the transmitter. When one pattern is blocked, the data transfers to the next one, and then the next one if",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/could-new-technique-fo-1.jpg,2024-04-09 10:22:00,Discover Brown and Rice University's breakthrough in terahertz communication: Curved signals bypass obstacles for enhanced wireless networks. Explore now! ,"necessary—allowing the signal to ""curve"" around the obstruction.

The research team successfully demonstrated this approach using computer simulations, showing how terahertz signals could navigate around corners and other barriers without losing significant data integrity. Although still in the early stages, this development holds great promise for overcoming the limitations imposed by traditional line-of-sight requirements in wireless communications.

In conclusion, harnessing the power of self-accelerating beams may revolutionize terahertz communication by enabling signals to curve around physical obstacles. With further exploration and refinement, such techniques could pave the way for faster, more reliable, and versatile wireless connections, unencumbered by the constraints of present-day technologies.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

In recent months, Instagram and its sister app, Threads, introduced a new default setting that restricts political content appearing in user feeds from accounts they don't follow. This move has sparked controversy, prompting hundreds of creators to rally behind an open letter initiated by GLAAD and Accountable Tech. These influencers demand that Instagram changes the political content limit to an opt-in feature instead of being automatically enabled.

Among those who have added their names to the appeal are notable personalities such as comedian Alok Vaid-Menon (1.3 million followers), Glee star Kevin McHale (1.1 million), news source So Informed (3.1 million), activists Carlos Eduardo Espina (664,000), and various meme accounts, political organizers, and entertainers.

According to Instagram, political content refers to anything ""potentially related to laws, elections, or social issues."" However, this ambiguous description raises concerns about how broadly the term might be interpreted and enforced, potentially endangering the visibility of marginalized voices discussing their real-life experiences. Furthermore, the restriction may hinder conversations surrounding crucial matters like climate change, firearm regulations, and reproductive rights.

Beyond affecting freedom of speech and expression, the limitations imposed by Instagram pose challenges for political content creators seeking to expand their audience base. Although Instagram does not offer substantial revenue sharing with creators, growing one's follower count on the platform can result in brand partnerships and alternative monetization possibilities. As America gears up for another election cycle, Instagram's choice to minimize exposure to political material appears counterintuitive given its past involvement in election controversies.

Meta, Instagram's parent company, risks exacerbating issues related to polarizing viewpoints and misinformation dissemination through its efforts to mute political discussions. By removing recommended political content and hindering access to diverse perspectives beyond individual networks, Meta may create isolated echo chambers, wherein users encounter limited opposing opinions, ultimately fostering entrenched beliefs and misunderstandings.

""By eliminating political suggestions as a default setting—and thus preventing individuals from discovering new political content—this policy creates significant barriers to political awareness, learning, and action,"" states the open letter. Consequently, the call to reverse these restrictions remains vital to preserving democratic values and encouraging healthy discourse across digital spaces.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1228781108.jpg?resize=1200,798",2024-04-10 20:11:30,"Here's a Meta Description that aligns with your guidelines:

In a breakthrough for IoT power supply, University of Utah engineers create a device gathering, storing electricity from thermal energy in remote settings.","

Harnessing Thermal Energy: The Future of Powering IoT Devices

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative force, driving innovation across various sectors. From agriculture to industry, IoT devices are revolutionizing the way we monitor and manage machinery, engines, and even soil conditions. However, the widespread adoption of these smart devices faces a significant hurdle: power supply.

The quest for a reliable power source for IoT devices in environments devoid of consistent electrical supply has led researchers to a groundbreaking discovery. At the University of Utah's College of Engineering, a team has developed a novel battery technology that could be the key to unlocking the full potential of IoT.

Enter the pyroelectrochemical (PEC) cell, a device that not only converts thermal energy into electricity but also stores it efficiently. This innovation is the brainchild of associate professors of mechanical engineering, Roseanne Warren and Shad Roundy. Their vision was to create an integrated device capable of harvesting ambient thermal energy and converting it directly into stored electrochemical energy, suitable for powering distributed sensors and IoT applications.

The PEC cell operates on a simple yet ingenious principle: it charges by leveraging the fluctuations in environmental temperatures. Whether nestled within the confines of a vehicle or buried just beneath the soil's surface, the PEC cell can harness the thermal changes to generate power. This capability makes it an ideal candidate for IoT applications that are impractical to recharge conventionally.

While solar cells have been a go-to solution for some time, they come with their own set of challenges. They require regular cleaning to maintain efficiency and are useless in environments devoid of sunlight. The PEC cell sidesteps these issues with its unique pyroelectric composite material, which consists of porous polyvinylidene fluoride and barium titanate nanoparticles. This material's electrical properties fluctuate with temperature changes, altering the polarization of the pyroelectric separator and creating an electric field that drives ions, enabling the storage of energy.

The research team, including lead author Tim Kowalchik, a graduate student in Warren's lab, has rigorously tested the PEC cell's functionality. Their experiments confirmed the predicted 'orientation effect,' where reversing the separator's orientation within the cell would cause ions to move in the opposite direction. This finding was crucial in demonstrating the cell's ability to store energy through temperature-induced polarization changes.

As the PEC cell passed its initial laboratory tests, the next challenge is to optimize its function for real-world applications. Circuit modeling is currently underway to refine the cell's design and enhance its performance.

The implications of this research are vast. With the PEC cell, the future of IoT looks brighter than ever. No longer will remote sensors be limited by their power sources. Instead, they will draw energy from the very environment they are monitoring, leading to a new era of efficiency and sustainability in technology.

The Solitude Conundrum: A Digital Solution

In the hustle of modern life, a silent struggle often goes unnoticed—the battle against loneliness. A startling revelation by the U.S. Surgeon General in 2023 highlighted that a staggering 50% of American adults felt the pangs of loneliness, a sentiment that predates the isolation brought on by the global pandemic. This isn't just a matter of feeling blue; the implications are serious, with loneliness potentially hiking the risk of heart disease by 29% and stroke by 32%.

Enter Buffet, a novel application poised to tackle this growing concern. It's a platform that marries the convenience of social matching with the ease of dining reservations—think Tinder meets OpenTable. Buffet's mission is simple yet profound: to dismantle the barriers to forming new connections, making the act of meeting up as seamless as possible.

Initially available in the vibrant city of Los Angeles, Buffet has set its sights on expanding to New York City and beyond. The app is the brainchild of two former financial analysts, Rich Hacking and Sean Emery, who, during a business trip in Dubai, envisioned a solution to the loneliness epidemic.

This is especially true in the field of soft robotics, where flexibility and compliance are key. Nature has spent billions of years perfecting these qualities, as evidenced by the impressive machinery found in animal biology.

Soft robotics have soft forms but often rely on rigid components, similar to traditional robots. Researchers are now working to incorporate flexible elements to enable movement in these soft robots. As MIT aptly puts it, ""our muscles are nature's perfect actuators.""

MIT researchers are taking this concept a step further by creating ""biohybrid"" robots that utilize live muscle tissue along with synthetic components. Ritu Raman, a Professor of Engineering at MIT, explained the process to TechCrunch, stating, ""We build the muscle tissues from mouse cells, and then we put the muscle tissues on our robot's skeleton. The muscles then function as actuators for the robot — every time the muscle contracts, the robot moves.""

The muscle fibers are connected to a spring-like structure called a ""flexure,"" which serves as a skeletal structure for the system. However, biological muscle tissue can be unpredictable and difficult to control. To be useful in robotic systems, the tissue must be reliable, predictable, and repeatable. This requires the use of structures that are compliant in one direction and resistant in the other.

Raman's team found a solution in Professor Martin Culpepper's MIT fabrication lab, where they discovered structures with 1/100th the stiffness of the muscle tissue. ""When the muscle contracts, all the force is converted into movement in that direction,"" Raman explains. ""It's a huge magnification.""

This muscle fiber/flexure system can be applied to various robots, regardless of size. However, the team is currently focused on creating extremely small robots that could one day operate inside the body to perform minimally invasive procedures.

In summary, the field of soft robotics is taking inspiration from nature to create more flexible and compliant components. MIT researchers are pushing the boundaries by incorporating live muscle tissue into robotic systems, resulting in more efficient and effective movement. While there are challenges to overcome, such as the unpredictability of biological muscle tissue, the potential applications for these biohybrid robots are vast",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MIT_Muscle-Flex-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-04-10 13:58:02,"""Discover muscle tissue-powered biohybrid robots at MIT, revolutionizing soft robotics with efficient, life-like movements.

Introduction

The need for effective and reliable radiation detection and monitoring has been underscored by recent events, such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the ongoing threat of radiation release from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Moreover, everyday operations of nuclear reactors, uranium mining and processing, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel require continuous monitoring of radioisotope release. Researchers from MIT and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have developed a novel approach to radiation detection, inspired by the classic computer game ""Tetris."" This groundbreaking method, published in Nature Communications, offers a more straightforward, cost-effective solution for pinpointing the direction and location of radioactive isotope sources.

The Challenge of Radiation Detection

Radiation is typically detected using semiconductor materials, like cadmium zinc telluride, which generate an electrical response when hit by high-energy radiation, such as gamma rays. However, discerning the direction of the radiation source can be challenging due to radiation's ability to penetrate matter easily. Geiger counters, for example, produce a click sound when exposed to radiation but do not provide information on energy or type. Consequently, locating a radiation source requires moving around to find the maximum sound, similar to using handheld metal detectors. This process involves moving closer to the radiation source, increasing risk.

Traditional radiation detection arrays utilize complex designs, including at least 100 pixels in a 10 by 10 array, to offer directional information from a stationary device. These arrays are often large and expensive, making them less practical for various applications.

A Tetris-Inspired Solution

The research team discovered that using as few as four pixels arranged in the tetromino shapes of the Tetris game's figures could provide directional information comparable to that of large, expensive systems. By placing an insulating material, like a lead sheet, between the pixels, the contrast between radiation readings from different directions increases. This approach enables the system to work effectively and maintain a simpler design.

The researchers found that the S-shaped array provided the most precise results, with directional readings accurate to within approximately 1 degree. Less symmetrical arrangements, such as the S-, J",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/with-inspiration-from-1.jpg,2024-04-10 12:27:01,"-, L-, and T-shapes, demonstrated accuracy within about 5 degrees. Although these precision levels might not match those achieved by larger arrays, they represent significant progress towards creating affordable and accessible radiation detection technology.

The Unseen Bias in AI: A Deep Dive into Language Models

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have revolutionized the way we interact with technology. However, a recent study by the University of Delaware has shed light on a concerning aspect of these models: the potential for inherent bias.

The study, spearheaded by Xiao Fang and Ming Zhao of the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, along with a team of researchers and doctoral students, delved into the biases of AI-generated content (AIGC). They utilized headlines from reputable news sources such as The New York Times and Reuters to prompt LLMs and then analyzed the generated content for gender and racial biases.

Their findings were startling. The AI models, operating on what could be likened to an AI subconscious, often produced content that was biased, even without any intention to do so. This bias was not marginal but significant, with some models displaying a 40% to 60% increase in biased language against minorities compared to the original articles.

The researchers employed a novel approach to measure bias, moving beyond the simple word count method that could mislabel contextually appropriate content as biased. Instead, they compared the AI's approach to that of the original journalists, examining the sentiment and language choice at a deeper level.

The implications of these findings are profound. Not only did the AI models produce biased content, but when prompted, most models except ChatGPT readily generated intentionally biased or discriminatory writing. This raises questions about the ethical use of AI and the responsibility of developers to mitigate such biases.

Fang and his team are now exploring ways to 'debias' these language models, emphasizing the importance of this research area. As AI continues to integrate into our daily lives, ensuring that it serves us without prejudice remains a paramount challenge.

This integration builds upon the existing vault services, offering a fortified haven for trading cards valued above $750. Launched in 2022, the eBay vault has become a cornerstone for collectors seeking security and optimal preservation conditions for their investments.

A Future Shaped by Collaboration

While the financial intricacies of these transactions remain confidential, the anticipation is high for their culmination in the second quarter of 2024. eBay CEO Jamie Iannone articulates the company's enthusiasm for this partnership, envisioning a redefined e-commerce landscape that caters to the fervor of collectors. PSA's esteemed reputation in the trading card domain complements eBay's expansive reach, setting the stage for a new era of confident buying, selling, and collecting.

eBay's Progressive Partnerships

This announcement trails eBay's recent collaboration with COMC, a sports trading card enterprise that has simplified the digitalization of collectibles for eBay's clientele. Furthermore, eBay's acquisition of the TCGplayer platform last year for $295 million underscores its commitment to becoming a powerhouse in the collectibles industry.

Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Collectible Ecosystem

eBay's strategic initiatives signal a transformative period for the trading card industry. By fostering partnerships and expanding its services, eBay is not just adapting to the evolving needs of collectors but is actively shaping the future of collectible commerce. As these plans unfold, the collectibles community watches with anticipation, ready to embrace a more connected, efficient, and secure collecting experience.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/eu-dma-browser-choice-screen-early-impact/,Alternative browsers report uplift after EU's DMA choice screen mandate, DMA Boosts Alternative Browsers: EU Choice Screens Fueling Competition ,"Title: Stirrings in the Mobile Browser Market: How the DMA Impacts Competition

Introduction

A landmark regulatory act in the European Union, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), is making waves in the mobile browser market. With just over a month since its enforcement, initial indications suggest that the DMA is fostering competition among browser providers, particularly benefiting smaller ones. This development comes as big technology companies like Apple and Google face greater scrutiny regarding their gatekeeping roles. Let's delve deeper into how these shifts might reshape the industry.

Early Signs of Impact

Reports reveal that lesser-known browsers such as Aloha, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi have noticed increases in interest following the DMA compliance deadline on March 7. However, other competitors like DuckDuckGo and Firefox claim it's premature to measure the legislation's effects accurately. Sixteen alternative browser developers, along with Apple and Google, were approached by TechCrunch for comment; however, neither Apple nor Google disclosed information concerning possible modifications in regional usage of their respective browsers.

Promoting Choice Screens

One significant aspect of the DMA aims to counteract platform dominance and biased defaults by requiring major firms—such as Apple and Google—to introduce browser choice screens. These screens expose users to various alternatives beyond Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome. Although users must actively choose another app for choice screens to bolster competition effectively, concerns linger regarding the screens' presentation. Certain alternative browser makers worry that the current designs could hinder optimal results. Consequently, hesitancy exists amongst some niche participants when sharing early impacts, primarily due to ongoing EU investigations examining alleged noncompliance by certain organizations.

Rollout Challenges

Android and iOS devices exhibit inconsistencies in implementing the DMA's requirements. On newer Android gadgets, choice screens are becoming increasingly commonplace; however, older device manufacturers determine if and when to present these screens to their customers. As a result, no uniform timeline guides this process across all Android devices. Meanwhile, Apple displays choice screens exclusively to iOS 17.4 users, leaving anyone using earlier versions without access to these prompts. Mozilla, developer of the Firefox browser, approximates that merely 20 percent of iPhone users have encountered a choice screen thus far. Given this fragmented landscape, estimating the DMA's overall influence becomes challenging.

Market Share Variations

When analyzing alternative browsers' market shares, additional complexities arise due to discrepancies in available applications per country. For instance, while Firefox appears in every EU region on iOS choice screens, Vivaldi is confined to just eight markets. Exposure to potential users varies significantly based upon the chosen browser, which introduces complications when measuring success metrics.

Conclusion

As the DMA continues shaping the mobile browser market, understanding its implications requires careful consideration of multiple factors influencing competition. Early adoption rates offer promising insights, but determining long-term consequences necessitate patience. Ongoing challenges related to choice screen implementation and uneven distribution across regions contribute to the complexity surrounding the analysis of market dynamics. Nonetheless, the winds of change seem to be blowing briskly through this sector, fueled by regulatory efforts aimed at enhancing consumer choices and promoting fairer practices.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-182865389.jpg?resize=1200,1094",2024-04-10 21:17:49,"Explore the impact of the EU's Digital Markets Act on mobile browser competition!

Introduction
In the bustling streets of Brazil, a new technological marvel is emerging, promising to safeguard the country's diverse wildlife and enhance road safety. This innovation comes in the form of a cutting-edge computer vision model capable of detecting wild animals in real time, potentially saving millions of lives.

The Drive for Innovation
The journey begins with the construction of a specialized computer vision model, a brainchild of researchers who have meticulously crafted a system to identify Brazil's unique fauna. The inspiration behind this project is a staggering statistic from the Brazilian Center for Road Ecology Studies: approximately 475 million animals fall victim to road accidents annually in Brazil alone.

The Architect of the System
Gabriel Souto Ferrante, the lead researcher and mastermind of the study at the University of São Paulo's Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, spearheaded the creation of a comprehensive database. This repository houses images of Brazilian species most susceptible to road incidents, serving as the foundation for training several computer vision models.

A Visionary Approach
The team's approach is distinguished by its use of YOLO (You Only Look Once), an algorithm renowned for its real-time object detection capabilities. This choice was driven by the need for swift identification of large animals, where speed is paramount. The system's design also allows for operation on edge devices, ensuring broad accessibility and practicality.

Challenges and Triumphs
Despite the success, challenges such as detection in low visibility conditions remain. However, the system has shown promise, correctly identifying species in 80% of daytime images. The researchers are committed to refining the technology, with plans to incorporate new images and collaborate with various stakeholders for real-world testing.

Integration and Future Prospects
The project's potential extends beyond wildlife protection. In 2020, the team developed a traffic condition app that could integrate with the animal detection system, offering a comprehensive solution for driver and animal safety.

Conclusion
As Brazil stands on the cusp of this technological breakthrough, the promise of a future where wildlife and drivers coexist harmoniously on the roads is within reach. This innovative system not only represents a significant stride in conservation efforts but also exemplifies the power of technology in serving humanity and the environment.

Introduction

Fusion energy, often perceived as the holy grail of power generation, has the potential to revolutionize the energy sector by providing an abundant source of energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions and virtually no long-living radioactive waste. A groundbreaking study by Hank Jenkins-Smith, Director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis at the University of Oklahoma, sheds light on American adults' perceptions of fusion energy, revealing broad support but also limited knowledge and frequent misconceptions that could hinder its development in the United States.

The Study

The study, published in the journal Fusion Science and Technology, explores whether public opinions about nuclear fission could impact the potential for fusion energy to become a major power source for the U.S. electrical grid. The research reveals that these social perspectives play a significant role and must be addressed by engineers, physicists, and regulatory specialists for fusion technology to be widely adopted.

Fusion vs. Fission

Fusion energy, which combines two atoms under extreme heat and pressure, differs from fission energy, where atoms are split. The fusion process is inherently safe, offering an abundant source of energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions and little long-lasting radioactive waste. On the other hand, fission energy has been associated with high-profile accidents, such as those at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, leading to public perceptions of fusion technology as risky and dangerous.

Addressing Misconceptions

The study found that less than half of the respondents had heard of fusion energy, with many confusing fission and fusion. To overcome these misconceptions, the fusion industry must adopt an exemplary safety culture, implementing multiple layers and processes to reduce potential accidents. Moreover, developers, regulators, and advocacy groups must be cautious with their messaging, avoiding overly optimistic claims that could be difficult or impossible to achieve.

Capitalizing on Technological Optimism

Americans generally have a positive outlook on new technologies, believing they can improve their lives. This technological optimism can be harnessed to foster support for fusion energy, driving economic growth, tackling climate change, and addressing international security and energy concerns.

This revised SEO title incorporates the main theme of the article - the introduction of a global cybercrime ranking system - and includes the notable fact that Russia leads the list. Keeping it concise ensures readability while still providing essential information for users searching online.","Title: Unmasking Cybercrime: A Global Perspective

A recent groundbreaking study has led to the creation of the first-ever ""World Cybercrime Index,"" a comprehensive ranking of nations according to their cybercrime activity. This index, published in the journal PLOS ONE, reveals that a small number of countries account for the majority of cybercriminal activity. Russia leads the list, followed by Ukraine, China, the United States, Nigeria, and Romania, with the United Kingdom at number eight.

Dr. Miranda Bruce, a co-author of the study from the University of Oxford and UNSW Canberra, explains that this research will enable both public and private sectors to concentrate their resources on significant cybercrime hotspots. This targeted approach will reduce wasted efforts and funds on countermeasures in countries with less severe cybercrime issues. Dr. Bruce further highlights the importance of understanding the geography of cybercrime and the specializations of different countries in various types of cybercrime.

The data for the index was gathered through a survey of 92 international cybercrime experts involved in intelligence and investigations. The survey focused on five major categories of cybercrime, with experts nominating and ranking countries based on the impact, professionalism, and technical skills of their cybercriminals. The study's co-author, Associate Professor Jonathan Lusthaus from the University of Oxford's Department of Sociology and Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, points out that cybercrime has historically been an invisible phenomenon due to offenders concealing their locations via fake profiles and technical protections.

Professor Federico Varese, another co-author from Sciences Po in France, emphasizes that this index is the initial step in a broader study aiming to understand the local aspects of cybercrime production worldwide. Future goals include analyzing the relationship between national characteristics, such as educational attainment, internet penetration, GDP, and corruption levels, and cybercrime prevalence.

The World Cybercrime Index serves as a valuable tool for law enforcement and policymakers, shedding light on the otherwise anonymous landscape of cybercrime. By continuously monitoring and updating this data, potential interventions can be implemented in at-risk countries before a severe cybercrime problem arises.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/meta-unveils-its-newest-custom-ai-chip/,Meta unveils its newest custom AI chip as it races to catch up, Meta Unveils Next-Gen MTIA Chip for AI Independence ,"Title: Meta's Next-Gen MTIA Chip: A Step Towards AI Independence

Introduction

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is making significant strides in its artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, aiming to catch up with industry competitors. Among these efforts include substantial investments in AI research, recruitment, and hardware development – particularly in creating custom chips to run and train Meta's AI models. This article discusses Meta's recent announcement of their second-generation Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), designed to improve model training efficiency.

The New MTIA: Specifications and Performance

Meta recently introduced the next generation of their ML training chip—the MTIA v2, following the footsteps of the initial MTIA v1 release. Unveiling this new technology just one day after Intel announced its latest AI accelerator hardware demonstrates Meta's determination to compete in the AI landscape.

Contrasting with its predecessor, manufactured utilizing a 7nm process, the newer MTIA employs a smaller 5nm process, enabling denser integration and improved performance. Although the next-gen MTIA requires more power (90W vs. 25W) due to increased processing cores, it offers enhanced features such as expanded internal memory (128MB vs. 64MB) and faster clock speeds (1.35 GHz up from 800 MHz). These improvements contribute to superior overall performance, claimed to deliver up to three times the results compared to MTIA v1. However, Meta did not specify how they calculated this ""3x"" improvement besides testing four key models on each chip.

Hardware Capabilities and Future Plans

According to Meta, the current-gen MTIA is already operational in sixteen of their data centers. Despite not presently employing the next-gen MTIA for large-scale generative AI tasks, Meta acknowledges multiple projects investigating potential applications. Furthermore, Meta clarified that the newly developed MTIA wouldn't render Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) obsolete; rather, it aims to supplement existing infrastructure.

Although Meta's hardware division progress may appear slow, there remains intense pressure on AI teams to reduce expenses related to GPU usage for training purposes. By investing in proprietary solutions, Meta could potentially minimize reliance on external vendors and decrease associated costs, especially considering the high expense of training advanced generative AI models.

Rivals Outpace Meta in Custom AI Hardware Race

While Meta works diligently to develop its custom chips, other tech giants maintain aggressive timelines in providing novel AI solutions. Recently, Google released its fifth-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU v5p) for cloud services and debuted the Axion, its first dedicated chip for deploying AI models. Moreover, Amazon possesses several generations of custom AI chipsets, whereas Microsoft entered the market late last year with the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Azure Cobalt 100 CPU.

Despite taking less time (fewer than nine months) to advance from prototype to production-ready versions of the MTIA v2, Meta still lags behind competitors regarding AI chipset innovation. With ambitious plans to gain autonomy from third-party GPU providers and rival industry leaders, Meta must continue improving upon its achievements thus far.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/meta-distorted-glitched.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-10 15:00:53,Discover Meta's Next-Gen MTIA Chip - Train AI Models More Efficiently!

Introduction

All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) have gained considerable interest as a safer alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries, which typically utilize flammable organic liquid electrolytes. Despite their promise, ASSBs face challenges related to thermal instability, particularly when using sulfide solid electrolytes. These challenges can lead to hazardous situations involving exothermic reactions and explosive decomposed products at the interface between sulfide solid electrolytes and electrode materials. Fortunately, researchers led by Professor Sung-Kyun Jung at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) may have found a solution by exploring the use of halide-based solid electrolytes. This groundbreaking discovery could set a new standard for developing safe battery systems.

Delving into Halide-Based Solid Electrolytes

While sulfide solid electrolytes show promise, their thermal instability remains a critical issue. Recognizing this limitation, the UNIST research team decided to investigate the use of halide-based solid electrolytes as a means to improve thermal stability. Replacing sulfides with halides like Li~3~InCl~6~ resulted in enhanced oxidation stability and significantly less oxygen evolution from the cathode compared to their sulfide counterparts.

Creating a Composite Material for Improved Performance

To test their hypothesis, the team created a composite material consisting of Li~3~YCl~6~ (LIC) and a charged cathode material (Li~1−x~Ni~0.6~Co~0.2~Mn~0.2~O~2~), referred to as NCM622. They discovered that incorporating the halide-based solid electrolyte helped delay the decomposition of NCM622 and inhibit the release of combustible oxygen gas via an endothermic phase transition process. Furthermore, the research team reported comparable improvements with other halide solid electrolytes, such as Li~3~YCl~6~ and Li~2~ZrCl~6~, combined with different cathode materials like LCO.

Interplay Between the Cathode and Solid Electrolyte

Perhaps most importantly, the research highlights the crucial role of the interaction between the cathode and solid electrolyte in controlling the thermal stability of ASSBs. Understanding this relationship opens up opportunities for designing better solid electrolytes tailored for secure battery systems.

Conclusion

As we move towards a greener future reliant on advanced energy storage solutions, safety continues to be paramount. With their innovative exploration of halide-based solid electrolytes, the UNIST research team presents a significant step forward in creating thermally stable all-solid-state batteries. Their work offers fresh insights and essential guidance for engineers working to develop safe battery technologies, providing hope for a safer, more sustainable world.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/new-study-reveals-enha.jpg,2024-04-09 09:58:24,"Discover enhanced thermal stability in all-solid-state batteries using halide solid electrolytes.
