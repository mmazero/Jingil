Introduction

In the digital age, the line between human and artificial interaction has blurred. A groundbreaking study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) has demonstrated the persuasive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The research reveals that participants debating LLMs with access to their personal information were significantly more likely to change their opinions compared to those who debated humans.

The Study: Assessing the Persuasive Power of LLMs

The EPFL study, titled ""On the Conversational Persuasiveness of Large Language Models: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"" aimed to quantify the persuasive power of LLMs and evaluate the impact of personalization on their performance. The researchers conducted a pre-registered study with 820 participants, assigning each individual a topic and one of four treatment conditions:

1. Debating a human with personal information.
2. Debating a human without personal information.
3. Debating an AI chatbot (GPT-4) with personal information.
4. Debating an AI chatbot (GPT-4) without personal information.

This experimental setup enabled a direct comparison of the persuasive capabilities of humans and LLMs in real conversations, providing a framework for benchmarking the performance of state-of-the-art models in online environments and the extent to which they can exploit personal data.

The Results: LLMs Outperform Humans in Persuasion

The study's findings revealed that participants who debated GPT-4 with access to their personal information had 81.7% higher odds of increased agreement with their opponents compared to participants who debated humans. Without personalization, GPT-4 still outperformed humans, but the effect was less pronounced.

Implications: Personalization and Microtargeting

The research indicates that LLMs can effectively exploit personal information to tailor their arguments and out-persuade humans in online conversations through microtargeting. This phenomenon is far more effective than human persuasion, as illustrated by the significant difference in agreement levels between participants debating humans and those debating AI chatbots with access to personal data.

Introduction

The digital landscape has become a breeding ground for negativity, abuse, and harmful exchanges. To tackle this growing concern, Google subsidiary Jigsaw introduced new features for its Perspective API, an innovative tool designed to detect and mitigate toxic conversations. This article delves into the updated Perspective API, exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can sift through online dialogues, promoting constructive discussions while diminishing abusive content.

Understanding Jigsaw's Perspective API

Perspective API integrates seamlessly into various platforms such as websites, applications, and comment sections, harnessing AI capabilities to recognize and prioritize valuable contributions over detrimental ones. By assessing comments using multiple attributes, the API determines whether a given statement adds positivity, fosters engagement, or enhances overall discussion quality.

New Experimental Bridging Attributes

Recently, Jigsaw augmented its API with experimental bridging attributes, introducing several novel assessment factors. Among these improvements are:

1. Nuanced comments: Identifying thoughtfulness, depth, and reflection in statements, thus encouraging well-rounded viewpoints.
2. Curiosity: Recognizing questions and openness towards learning, stimulating intellectual exchange.
3. Personal stories: Highlighting shared experiences and empathy-building narratives, strengthening connections between individuals.
4. Reasoning: Detecting attempts to comprehend complex concepts, nurturing understanding and critical thinking skills.
5. Deference and appreciation: Celebrating respectful interactions and gratitude, cultivating a supportive community atmosphere.

Scoring System Explained

Upon analyzing a comment, Perspective assigns a probability score to each relevant attribute—for instance, measuring toxicity, obscenities, sexual suggestiveness, and presence of curiosity or nuance. Based on these scores, users can identify potentially offensive material and decide appropriate actions accordingly. Moderators could promote insightful comments, demote damaging remarks, or establish threshold settings to filter out undesirable content autonomously.

Addressing Contextual Limitations

A significant challenge faced by Perspective involves interpreting context correctly, as removing content from its surroundings might lead to misinterpretations. Although Perspective excels at objective judgment, determining the intent behind certain phrases requires understanding their intended meaning within a broader setting. Acknowledging this limitation, Jigsaw aims to incorporate context awareness in future iterations, improving the algorithm's effectiveness.

Conclusion

With persistent efforts to combat online toxicity, Jigsaw's revamped Perspective API offers promising potential in transforming virtual spaces into healthier environments. As developers gain access to these new attributes, fresh opportunities arise for creating unique solutions tailored to diverse communities, paving the way toward enhanced interaction and collaboration amongst netizens.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/f66ea6a4095e9db8780165564cd126f71a002168/2024/04/16/8d28ca32-ae43-4a21-8117-bf6c7a8527a3/puzzle-pieces-circle-jigsaw.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"""Combat online toxicity with Jigsaw's AI-powered Perspective API - Boost positive discourse & curb abusive content!""", Combat online toxicity ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

As we rely more on digital technology, online personal data security has become a critical concern. Encryption systems form the backbone of internet communication, ensuring privacy and security. Recently, researchers have turned their attention to the potential of metasurface technology, with its remarkable ability to manipulate light, and its integration with holograms. However, limitations in data storage capacity have posed challenges. A groundbreaking study by a team of researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) has tackled this issue by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystals to create an advanced optical encryption system.

The Breakthrough

Led by Professor Junsuk Rho and a team of researchers from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, the team has successfully developed a dynamic hyperspectral holography system enabled by inverse-designed metasurfaces with oblique helicoidal cholesterics (OHCs). The research, published in Advanced Materials, details the creation of ten independent holograms with varying colors and shapes, each seamlessly switchable.

The Challenge: Limited Storage Capacity

Metasurface technology has shown great potential in manipulating light, but storing large amounts of information on a single metasurface has been a limitation. To address this, the research team employed an inverse design technique driven by artificial intelligence, encoding holograms with different colors and shapes across ten wavelengths ranging from 420 to 720 nanometers (nm).

The Innovation: Oblique Helicoidal Cholesterics

The team integrated an OHC-based wavelength modulator, allowing for the accurate implementation of the designed holograms even without the exact light wavelength. The OHCs can precisely reflect light at specific wavelengths (bandwidth < 30 nm) by adjusting the internal layered structure gap in response to external stimuli, such as electric fields and temperature, within a wide wavelength range (400 nm to 720 nm).

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/a-crypto-wallet-makers-warning-about-an-imessage-bug-sounds-like-a-false-alarm/,A crypto wallet maker's warning about an iMessage bug sounds like a false alarm, Trust Wallet's iMessage Bug Warning Debunked: No Legitimate Zero-Day Exposé ,"Title: Navigating the Claimed iMessage ""Zero-Day"" Exploit Threat: A Deep Dive

Introduction

Recently, Trust Wallet, a popular crypto wallet manufacturer, took to social media warning users of an alleged high-risk zero-day exploit threatening iMessage on the Dark Web. According to their statement, this exploit supposedly targeted iPhone users, putting them at risk without requiring any interaction from the victim's end. However, upon closer examination, things might not be as dire as initially suggested. Let's delve deeper into the matter, separating fact from fiction.

Unmasking the Truth Behind the Allegations

When Trust Wallet first raised concerns over the alleged exploit, many questions were left unanswered. Upon investigating further, it turned out that the so-called intelligence was merely an ad on a dubious dark web site named CodeBreach Lab. Interestingly, the ad offered the exploit for a staggering sum of $2 million worth of Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) Explained

To understand the gravity of the situation, let us examine Remote Code Execution (RCE), a potent type of exploit. Essentially, RCE enables hackers to gain complete control of a target device through the Internet. Combined with a ""zero-click"" capability—meaning the exploit doesn't require any action from the user—an RCE becomes highly sought after and valued among cybercriminals due to its stealthiness. Currently, companies dealing in zero-days pay upwards of $3-$5 million for such elusive exploits.

Fading Hopes of a Legitimate Zero-Day

Considering the questionable source of the alleged exploit, along with the lack of supporting evidence, security professionals believe this claim is likely nothing more than a hoax designed to instill fear and mistrust. Though real zero-days do pose significant threats and have been employed by state-backed hacking teams for years, the chances of everyday users falling prey to such sophisticated attacks are relatively low.

Safer Alternatives: Lockdown Mode

Instead of panicking and turning off services like iMessage altogether, consider enabling Lockdown Mode on your Apple devices. Introduced recently, Lockdown Mode restricts access to various device features and functionalities, thereby minimizing opportunities for malicious actors to compromise your digital life. Notably, Apple reports no successful breaches involving devices utilizing Lockdown Mode thus far. Cybersecurity specialists widely endorse and recommend employing this feature.

CodeBreach Lab: Questionable Credentials

Further adding to doubts surrounding the legitimacy of the exploit is the obscurity of CodeBreach Lab itself. With minimal online presence and scarce verifiable information available, the website fails to establish trustworthiness required for selling sensitive materials like zero-day exploits. Thus, it seems plausible that the entire incident represents little more than a brazen attempt to swindle unsuspecting victims out of substantial amounts of money.

Conclusion

While remaining vigilant against ever-evolving cyberthreats remains crucial, reacting hastily to unsubstantiated rumors can lead to unnecessary panic and inconvenience. As illustrated above, initial fears concerning an iMessage exploit appear largely unfounded. To stay safe in today's digitally connected world, arm yourself with knowledge, utilize built-in protective measures, and maintain healthy skepticism towards sensationalized claims.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/phone-bomb-1.png?resize=1200,675",2024-04-16 18:51:46,"Discover the truth behind the claimed iMessage ""zero-day"" exploit threatening iMessage on the Dark Web.

In a groundbreaking study, a team of international scientists has uncovered a new method to enhance battery design, potentially leading to safer and more powerful lithium batteries. This discovery, published in the journal Nature Materials, was made possible through the use of quasi-elastic neutron scattering at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

In conventional lithium batteries, liquid electrolytes pose a significant safety risk due to their tendency to catch fire. To address this issue, researchers have turned their attention to polymer electrolytes, which do not share this hazardous trait. Eugene Mamontov, the ORNL Chemical Spectroscopy group leader, emphasized the importance of materials science in this context: ""It all comes down to the study of materials. And polymer electrolytes won't catch fire the way liquid electrolytes do in lithium batteries.""

The central question that the team sought to answer involved the time it takes for lithium ions to break free from the tiny cages created by polymer electrolytes. This information is crucial for understanding energy flow within the battery, as well as for enabling more energy-dense electrodes, such as lithium metal.

Through the use of neutron scattering techniques at ORNL, the team was able to settle a long-standing debate on this topic.

Introduction

In a significant shift for its mobile ecosystem, Apple is now allowing users in the European Union to download iOS apps directly from developer websites. This change comes as part of Apple's efforts to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to level the competitive playing field for platforms' business users and protect consumers from potential abuse of power by tech giants.

The New Era of Web-Based App Downloads

Starting with the release of iOS 17.5 beta 2, developers can now distribute iOS apps directly from their websites to EU users. This new entitlement is available to developers who meet Apple's criteria, which include app notarization requirements and acceptance of new EU business terms. The business terms include a new ""core technology fee"" of €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months, regardless of where apps are distributed.

Developers can avoid the fee by sticking to Apple's old business terms, but this means they will not have access to any DMA entitlements. The DMA-driven reforms include more flexibility for in-app payments, a ban on anti-steering measures, and the ability for developers to inform users of cheaper offers available outside the App Store.

Apple's Commitment to Safety and Security

To distribute apps from their websites, developers must be in good standing with Apple's developer program, attest to handling IP disputes and government takedown requests, and commit to providing iOS users with customer service. All apps distributed from the web must meet Apple's notarization requirements to ensure platform integrity and protect users from external risks.

Apple maintains that sideloading apps carries inherent security risks for mobile users. While the DMA allows gatekeepers to apply security measures, critics argue that Apple's design for the authorization flow for direct web downloads is intended to inject friction and dissuade users from stepping outside the App Store.

Addressing the Concerns of Critics

Apple's approach to several aspects of DMA compliance is currently under investigation by the European Commission. Critics argue that Apple's implementation of ""scare screens"" during the authorization process for direct web downloads is designed to discour","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-16 17:00:02,"Download iOS Apps Directly from Developer Websites: Apple's EU Change ⬇

Introduction

The highly competitive landscape of the high-end smartphone market sees major players like Samsung and Apple vying for supremacy. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers are steadily gaining ground by offering affordable alternatives without compromising quality. According to recent reports from the International Data Corporation (IDC), despite Samsung's successful regaining of the top spot in Q1 of 2024, there is an evident power shift occurring among the top five companies. This article delves deeper into these findings and provides insights on what to expect moving forward in the ever-evolving mobile device market.

Market Leadership Shift

In Q1 of 2024, Samsung once again claimed the title of the world's largest smartphone vendor after dethroning Apple. Based on IDC's preliminary data, global smartphone shipments increased by almost 8%, reaching 289.4 million units during this period. Notably, this marked the third consecutive quarter of expansion in the global smartphone market, indicating a robust recovery phase.

According to IDC Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers team vice president Ryan Reith, the trend suggests that dominant smartphone providers such as Samsung and Apple could strengthen their grip on the premium segment. Simultaneously, smaller brands might find it challenging to carve out a niche amidst fierce competition. In Q1 of 2024, Samsung held approximately 21% of the total market share, having shipped 60.1 million devices. On the other hand, Apple captured slightly above 17% of the market with 50.1 million iPhone shipments – albeit experiencing a slight decrease compared to the previous quarter.

Rising Challengers: Chinese Manufacturers

Chinese competitors like Xiaomi and Transsion made significant strides in the smartphone arena, narrowing the gap between themselves and the established giants. During Q1 of 2024, Xiaomi witnessed a remarkable surge of around 33%, shipping 40.8 million devices, consequently securing the third rank in the overall smartphone market. Similarly, Transsion exhibited impressive growth of roughly 85%, amounting to 28.5 million shipments and occupying the fourth slot. These numbers demonstrate how Chinese OEMs pose a formidable challenge to traditional heavyweights like Samsung and Apple.

Post-Recovery Outlook

With the smartphone market seemingly recovering, Nabila Popal, Research Director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team, stated that a transformation in the dynamics amongst the top five entities would persist. Companies would need to reassess their strategies to stay relevant in a post-recovery setting.

Popal further emphasized that Xiaomi had begun to bounce back strongly from the considerable setbacks encountered over the preceding couple of years. Moreover, she mentioned that Transsion had emerged as a consistent force in the upper echelons, demonstrating substantial development through rapid growth across various international markets. As we move ahead, it is crucial to monitor how these emerging trends unfold and influence the balance of power in the intensely contested high-end smartphone domain.

Conclusion

As per IDC's latest report, Samsung has managed to recapture its status as the premier smartphone supplier in Q1 of 2024; however, challenges remain abundant due to relentless competition. While maintaining dominance in the high-end section, Samsung and Apple must fend off ambitious Chinese adversaries seeking wider consumer bases.

According to Yahoo Finance data, Tesla trades at a price/sales multiple of 6.2x, whereas GM and Ford are valued at 0.34x and 0.29x, respectively. These multiples reflect investor optimism towards Tesla's continued expansion and its potential dominance beyond the realm of passenger vehicles. However, Tesla's recent missteps could indicate a shift towards traditional business practices, potentially diminishing its perceived value among investors.

Mitigating Risks Amidst Uncertainty

As Tesla grapples with internal changes and external pressures, maintaining investor confidence remains crucial for long-term success. While competitors gain ground, Tesla must demonstrate resilience and innovation to preserve its leadership position. Key strategies include enhancing battery technology, expanding charging infrastructure, diversifying product offerings, and solidifying partnerships across various sectors. By focusing on technological advancements and strategic collaborations, Tesla can continue captivating consumers and appeasing stakeholders alike.

Introduction

The ocean is a vast and largely uncharted territory, covering more than 80% of the Earth's surface. However, only about 20% of the ocean floor has been mapped, primarily due to the challenges associated with deep-sea exploration. These challenges include extreme pressure, zero visibility, and frigid temperatures. As interest in the ocean and its resources grows, researchers are turning to biomimicry to create more efficient and practical deep-sea submersibles.

Traditional Submersibles: A Historical Perspective

In the past, deep-sea submersibles were designed with manned operation in mind, using technologies and materials from the mid-twentieth century. These early submersibles were large, heavy, and difficult to maneuver due to their reliance on propellers and rudders for movement. Over time, the incorporation of remote and unmanned operation technologies improved functionality, but production and operation costs remained high.

Today's submersibles leverage solid buoyancy materials for more compact designs and ultra-high strength steel and other lightweight metals to lower weight while improving hull strength, maneuverability, and manufacturing and operating costs. However, the next generation of submersibles will be characterized by the fusion of biomimicry and advanced technologies, leading to the emergence of robotic fish-type submersibles.

Biomimetic Robotic Fish-Type Submersibles: The Future of Deep-Sea Exploration

In contrast to traditional submersibles, biomimetic robotic fish-type submersibles are designed to look like and emulate the locomotion of real fish. This approach offers several advantages, including enhanced maneuverability, energy efficiency, and noise reduction compared to traditional submersibles. Moreover, biomimetic robotic fish-type submersibles disturb the surrounding water less than those with propellers, making them ideal for underwater research, rescue and salvage operations, marine equipment installation and maintenance, and underwater archaeology, cinematography, and tourism.

LG's CineBeam Q projector is a game-changer in the world of portable projectors. Weighing just three pounds, this device offers 4K resolution and an impressive image size of up to 120 inches. Its laser RGB light source creates vivid, robust images, turning any blank wall into a captivating movie screen or gaming display. Let's delve into the unique features that make the CineBeam Q stand out from its competitors.

Key Features and Benefits

One of the most appealing features of the CineBeam Q is its auto keystone screen adjustment technology. This feature allows the projector to sense and adjust the picture to the space you're projecting on, making focusing and image arrangement a breeze. Adjusting the rotating kickstand to the proper height enables projection at any angle, even straight up, creating a ceiling screen for a cozy, lying-down viewing experience.

The CineBeam Q operates similarly to an LG smart TV, with LG's webOS 6 pulling up an app menu where you can load different streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube. You can also plug in an Apple TV or Chromecast with Google TV for added functionality. The projector offers one HDMI port, one USB-C port, and a power port for physical connections to other devices like gaming consoles or soundbars.

However, the CineBeam Q's internal three-watt speakers may not convey a theatrical experience, so you might want to consider getting an accompanying soundbar or Bluetooth speaker for a more immersive audio experience.

Image Quality and Considerations

Under optimal lighting conditions, the Q projects at 500 ANSI lumens of brightness, offering vibrant, bright, and visibly 4K images with high contrast. However, it's essential to note that projectors like the Q require a dark space for optimal image quality. In spaces with ambient light, the image quality may degrade quickly, with vibrant colors becoming washed out and cloudy.
