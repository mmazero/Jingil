This open-source project is backed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry, including AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap.

Redis is a widely used data store that powers many large commercial and open-source deployments. Its history is marked by a few licensing disputes, including a recent change in licensing that made it difficult to create a commercial version of the software. This led to the creation of Valkey, which is now being hosted by the Linux Foundation.

The original Redis license was permissive, allowing for multiple branches and different licensing and development ideas. However, the recent change in licensing made it incompatible with the standard definition of ""open source."" This change opened the door for a commercial version of the software.

The major cloud service providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle, have all profited from the open-source version of Redis. They are now launching a fork within the Linux Foundation. This fork, called Valkey, is being backed by AWS and is designed to keep the old group of maintainers together.

AWS longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson started the project in her own GitHub account. When the news broke that Redis had changed its license, many of the current Redis maintainers immediately decided to move on. The original Redis private channel included five maintainers, three from Redis, Olson, and Alibaba's Zhao Zhao, as well as a small group of committers who immediately signed on to what is now Valkey.

Redis founder Salvatore Sanfilippo had initially launched the project under the BSD license, partly because he wanted to be able to create a commercial fork at some point. However, the new license requires commercial agreements to offer Redis-as-a-service, making it difficult to create a commercial version of the software.

The current reality is that the large cloud vendors, with the notable exception of Microsoft, quickly rallied behind Valkey. This fork originated at AWS, where longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson initially started the project in her own GitHub account. The maintainers from Redis unsurprisingly did not sign on, but as David Nally, AWS's director for open-source strategy and marketing, told me, the Valkey community would welcome them with open arms.

In conclusion, the creation of Valkey is a significant event in the open-source community. This fork of Redis is backed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry and is designed to keep the old group of maintainers together. While the original Redis license change was a contentious issue, AWS and other cloud service providers have quickly rallied behind Valkey. This fork is expected to be a major player in the in-memory data store market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"""Valkey: Revolutionizing In-memory Data Storage with the Support of AWS, Google Cloud, and More!

Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECTs): A Promising Class of Transistors for Neuromorphic Systems

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are a new class of transistors that have shown great potential in modulating electrical current in response to small changes in voltage applied to their gate electrode. These transistors could revolutionize the development of various brain-inspired and wearable technologies. However, most conventional OECTs developed so far have been found to exhibit various limitations, including limited stability and slow redox processes, which can significantly impair their performance.

A recent study by researchers at Northwestern University has proposed a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs. Their approach, outlined in a paper published in Nature Electronics, was used to create various electronic components based on OECT arrays and circuits.

The researchers successfully fabricated p- and n-channel vertical OECT active-matrix arrays using a novel e-beam exposure process. This technique allowed them to produce a pattern on the semiconducting films without employing masks or chemical solvents that could damage the materials. This made the films electronically inactive (i.e., insulating) without affecting their ability to conduct ions.

The resulting p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays exhibited transconductances of 0.08-1.7 S, transient times of less than 100 µs, and stable switching properties of more than 100,000 cycles. Additionally, the researchers successfully used their fabrication strategy to create vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These circuits performed remarkably well while maintaining excellent operational stability.

The study's findings highlight the potential of OECTs in developing biosensors, wearable devices, and neuromorphic systems. However, the researchers noted that restrictions in the micro- and nanopatterning of organic semiconductors, as well as topological irregularities, often limit their use in monolithically integrated circuits.

In conclusion, the new e-beam exposure strategy developed by the Northwestern University researchers promises to significantly boost the stability and performance of OECT circuits. The study's findings pave the way for the scalable fabrication of OECTs, contributing to their integration into electronic devices.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/microsoft-to-unbundle-office-and-teams-globally-following-years-long-criticism/,Microsoft to unbundle Office and Teams globally following years-long criticism, Microsoft Unbundles Office and Teams Globally amid Criticism ,"Microsoft is set to release a new version of its Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscription service that excludes Teams, following a review by the European Union regulator and complaints from rival Slack. The move comes after Microsoft agreed to sell Office 365 without Microsoft Teams in the EU and Switzerland in 2020.

Microsoft introduced Teams as a complementary service to the Office 365 suite in 2017, but some businesses argued that the company had an unfair advantage by bundling the two offerings. Slack, which is owned by Salesforce, called the move ""illegal,"" claiming that Microsoft forced installation of Teams on customers through the market-dominant productivity suite and concealed the true cost of the chat and video service.

In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft said that the unbundling ""also addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardize their purchasing across geographies.""

Reuters reported that Microsoft will introduce the new Office 365 lineups on Monday, but Microsoft had not yet implemented the change at the time of publication. TechCrunch has reached out to Microsoft for more information, and we will provide updates as we receive them.

The new version of Office 365 will provide businesses with more flexibility and control over their purchases, while still retaining the core Office 365 suite of tools. This move is likely to be seen as a positive step by many businesses, as it will give them more control over their productivity and collaboration tools.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1247881669-e1693474665289.jpg?resize=1200,676",2024-04-01 10:02:40,Want to learn more about Microsoft's latest move to unbundle Office and Teams?
