It's that time again - our weekly recap of everything you need to know in the world of startups! This week, we've got the scoop on Y Combinator's latest batch of startups, a deep dive into the financials of Truth Social, and much more.

Y Combinator's AI-Fueled Batch

Y Combinator, one of the most well-known startup accelerators, recently revealed its latest batch of companies. Not surprisingly, AI was a major theme, with 86 out of 247 companies identifying as AI startups. However, with 187 companies mentioning AI in their pitches, it's starting to feel like we're reaching bubble territory. We've rounded up the 18 most interesting startups from this batch, as well as the TechCrunch staff favorites.

Truth Social: The Reality of Burning Cash

Trump's Truth Social, which recently debuted on Nasdaq as $DJT, is losing money at an alarming rate. The company reported a $58 million loss on just $4 million in revenue. Unlike typical Silicon Valley startups that ""burn cash now, profit later,"" Truth Social's story is more of a ""burn cash now, and that's it"" kind of tale. The company's lifelines are fraying, with no explosive user growth, no VC sugar daddies, and the unenviable position of being publicly accountable while trying to juggle a business model that seems to repel advertisers like it's made of antimatter.

Rubrik's IPO: A Tale of Modest Growth and Eye-Watering Losses

Cybersecurity darling Rubrik, which has been guzzling venture capital like it's going out of style, has filed for an IPO. The company's history of bleeding money and modest revenue growth is a common tale in the tech world. However, Rubrik's pivot to subscription models is as groundbreaking as deciding to sell software as a service.

Accel, the venture capital firm known for its Indian unicorn collection, has shifted its focus to the region. The firm has been actively investing in early-stage startups and has already seen success with several of its portfolio companies. Analysts predict that India's technology sector will continue to grow, making it an attractive market for venture capital firms.

In the latest batch of Y Combinator startups, AI was a major theme, with 86 out of 247 companies identifying as AI startups. The sheer number of AI-focused companies has raised concerns about a potential bubble, but some standout startups are making a name for themselves. Meanwhile, Truth Social, the social media platform backed by former President Donald Trump, is losing money rapidly, with a reported $58 million loss on just $4 million in revenue. The company's financial struggles are a reminder of the risks associated with startups, even those with high-profile backing.

In other news, Rubrik, a cybersecurity firm, has filed for an IPO after a history of bleeding money and modest revenue growth. However, the company's pivot to subscription models presents a unique opportunity for growth and success. And finally, Accel has shifted its focus to India's technology sector, which has seen significant growth in recent years. The firm's investments in early-stage startups highlight the potential of the region and its unicorn collection continues to grow.

Mahbod Moghadam, an influential figure in the startup world, passed away last month at the age of 41 due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. Moghadam was known for his work as the co-founder of Genius, Everipedia, and his recent endeavors in helping creators get paid directly for their work.

The news of Moghadam's passing became widely known over the weekend, with many tributes pouring in on social media platforms. A post on Genius, attributed to his family, confirmed the unfortunate news. Former TechCrunch writer-turned-investor Josh Constine, who interviewed Moghadam in the early days of Genius, described him as a ""complex, edgy, and at times problematic guy, but also genuinely funny, brilliant, and always unique.""

Moghadam had been living in Los Angeles, where he was focusing on developing new ways to help creators get compensated for their work. One of his recent projects was HellaDoge, a social media platform that aimed to pay users in dogecoin for contributing dogecoin-related content. The idea was to create a platform where users would directly benefit from their participation, unlike traditional platforms such as Facebook or Twitter that generate ad revenue.

Moghadam's interest in creators' compensation can be traced back to 2009. After graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, he became a lawyer just as the economy was collapsing. When he was let go from his law firm, he used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman. Rap Genius started as a platform for users to annotate and explain hip-hop lyrics, eventually expanding its remit and rebranding as Genius.

Despite the success of Genius, Moghadam's tenure at the company was marked by controversy due to his belligerent behavior. In 2014, he resigned from Genius after posting provocative comments on a murderer's manifesto on the platform. Following his resignation, Moghadam co-founded Everipedia, a blockchain",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8698091273_475f659390_b.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-07 01:51:05,"-based encyclopedia, with Samuel Brock and Theodor Forselius.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scalable-learningbased-framework-teleoperation-humanoid.html,A scalable reinforcement learning-based framework to facilitate the teleoperation of humanoid robots, New Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Robot Teleoperation ,"Title: Teleoperating Humanoid Robots with Human2HumanOid: A Revolutionary Approach

Introduction

The prospect of controlling robots remotely, also known as teleoperation, has long been a topic of interest in the field of robotics. This technology could allow humans to perform a wide range of tasks from a distance, including dangerous and complex procedures. Moreover, teleoperation could be used to collect human motion datasets, which could significantly aid in training humanoid robots for new tasks.

Recently, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University developed Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), a novel method for the effective teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots. This pioneering approach, introduced in a paper posted to the arXiv preprint server, could enable humanoid robots to learn specific sets of movements required for various tasks, such as playing sports, pushing carts, or moving boxes.

The H 2 O System: Bridging the Gap Between Humans and Humanoids

The H 2 O system facilitates the real-time teleoperation of full-sized humanoid robots, relying only on an RGB camera. This is in contrast to many other methods, which often require complex setups and multiple sensors. The simplicity of the H 2 O system makes it easily scalable and widely applicable.

Tairan He, a co-author of the paper, explained to Tech Xplore, ""We believe that human teleoperation will be essential for scaling up the data flywheel for humanoid robots, and making teleoperation accessible and easy to do is our main objective."" The study combines elements from prior research, such as physics-based animation of human motions, transferring human motions to real-world humanoids, and teleoperating humanoids, into a single framework.

H 2 O: A Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework

The H 2 O teleoperation framework is based on reinforcement learning (RL), enabling real-time whole-body teleoperation of humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. The process begins with retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities through a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints. The refined motion dataset then trains an RL-based motion imitator in simulation,",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-scalable-reinforceme.jpg,2024-04-06 08:30:01,"Master Humanoid Control with Carnegie Mellon's H 2 O Framework: Teleoperate humanoids in real-time for safer, more efficient search & rescue missions.

Social network X has recently announced that it will be granting Premium tier subscribers access to xAI's Grok chatbot. This announcement comes after Elon Musk announced the expansion of the chatbot to more paid users last month. The company confirmed that only Premium and Premium+ users can interact with the chatbot in select regions.

Previously, Grok was only available to Premium+ users, who paid a $16 per month or a $168 per year subscription fee. However, with the latest update, users paying $8 per month can now access the chatbot. Users can engage with Grok in either ""Regular mode"" or ""Fun mode,"" with labels indicating when the chatbot might return inaccurate answers.

Grok's capabilities go beyond simple summarization. Recently, Social network X introduced a new explore view inside Grok, which summarizes trending news stories. However, Grok takes it a step further by generating headlines, although there have been instances where the chatbot produced inaccurate information. For example, Grok wrote a fake headline stating ""Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles.""

Elon Musk's intention behind expanding access to Grok is likely to rival other products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, or Anthropic’s Claude. Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations over the last few months, even going so far as to sue the company in March over what he perceives as a betrayal of its non-profit goal. In response, OpenAI filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk’s claims and released email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

In addition to opening up access to Grok, xAI also open-sourced the chatbot but without providing any training data details. While this raises questions about whether this is the latest version of the model and if the company will be more transparent about its approach to the development of the model and information about the training data, it's clear that Grok is a powerful tool that Social network X's Premium users can now take advantage of.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-framework-air-ground-robot-complex.html,A framework to improve air-ground robot navigation in complex occlusion-prone environments, AGRNav: Enhancing Air-Ground Robot Navigation in Occlusion-Prone Environments ,"Title: AGRNav: Revolutionizing Air-Ground Robot Navigation in Occlusion-Prone Environments

Introduction

Robotic systems have become increasingly prevalent in various indoor environments, assisting humans in performing manual tasks and answering simple queries. However, the future holds the potential for these robots to navigate unknown and unmapped outdoor environments, where obstacles may easily obstruct their sensors, increasing the risk of collisions. Air-ground robots, in particular, could be highly effective for navigating complex outdoor settings and tackling intricate tasks. Recently, researchers from the University of Hong Kong introduced AGRNav, a novel framework designed to enhance the autonomous navigation of air-ground robots in occlusion-prone environments.

The Challenge: Occlusions in Complex Environments

Air-ground robots possess exceptional mobility and long endurance, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from searching for survivors after natural disasters to delivering packages to remote locations. However, navigating complex environments, such as forests and large buildings, poses a significant challenge due to the presence of occluded and unknown regions. Existing mapping-based and learning-based navigation methods often result in suboptimal trajectories for these robots.

The AGRNav Framework: A Solution

To address this challenge, the researchers developed AGRNav, a framework consisting of two main components: a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) and a hierarchical path planner. The SCONet component predicts the distribution of obstacles in an environment and their semantic features using a deep learning approach that requires minimal computational power. The hierarchical path planner, on the other hand, uses the predictions made by SCONet to plan optimal, energy-efficient aerial and ground paths for the robot to reach a specified location.

The SCONet component captures contextual information and occlusion area features by employing a self-attention mechanism, enabling accurate obstacle predictions. Following this, a query-based method is used for low-latency updates of prediction results to the grid map. Finally, the hierarchical path planner searches for energy-saving paths based on the updated map.

AGRNav in Action: Superior Performance in Simulations and Real-World Experiments

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/elon-musk-says-hell-unveil-a-tesla-robotaxi-on-august-8/,Elon Musk says he'll unveil a Tesla robotaxi on August 8, Tesla's Robotaxi Unveiled on August 8: Musk's Autonomous Vision ,"Title: The Future of Mobility: Tesla's Robotaxi Revelation

Elon Musk, the enigmatic CEO of Tesla, recently made headlines by announcing the unveiling of a robotaxi on August 8. This announcement comes in the wake of Tesla's EV sales lagging and profits falling, leaving the company and its CEO in search of a new product to boost sales or the stock price.

Previously, Reuters reported that Tesla was abandoning its plan to build a lower-cost EV. Instead, the company would focus its resources on a robotaxi, which is being developed on the same small EV platform initially intended for the affordable car. Musk quickly dismissed these claims on X, the social network he owns, labeling Reuters as ""lying"" without providing any specific disputes.

Throughout the years, rumors have circulated about Tesla working on two vehicles: a traditional car and one without a steering wheel or pedals. Musk has wavered between prioritizing a typical car or a more unconventional vehicle, even as his engineers insisted on referencing a car with standard controls. According to Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, the CEO resisted this push, but lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy maintained a more traditional car version as a ""shadow project.""

Musk has long promised autonomous capabilities in Tesla vehicles. In 2016, he claimed that a Tesla would drive itself cross-country by the end of 2017, a goal that was never met. In 2019, he promised to launch the company's first robotaxis and establish an autonomous ride-sharing network in 2020, another pledge that went unfulfilled. Despite these setbacks, Musk still asserts that a dedicated robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals will come to market by 2024.

Tesla vehicles are equipped with a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, and for an additional $12,000, owners can purchase ""full self-driving"" (FSD). FSD is a feature that Musk has promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. However, Tesla vehicles are not currently self-driving.

Crowdfense's latest price list reveals a significant increase in the value of zero-day exploits compared to their previous list published in 2019. The highest payouts offered now are $7 million for iOS zero-days, $5 million for Android zero-days, $3.5 million for Safari zero-days, and $5 million for WhatsApp and iMessage zero-days. This surge in pricing can be attributed to the heightened security measures implemented by tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, making it increasingly difficult to exploit their devices and applications.

The Difficulty in Uncovering Zero-Days

As companies enhance their security features, the process of discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities becomes more challenging. Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, notes that it should be progressively harder to exploit software and devices year over year. Shane Huntley, the head of Google's Threat Analysis Group, concurs, stating that as more zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and platform protections continue to improve, the time and effort required from attackers increase, resulting in a higher cost for their findings.

Google's 2023 report indicated that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild last year, with 75% of zero-days targeting Google products and Android being attributed to spyware vendors, which often work with zero-day brokers. Security analyst David Manouchehri, who has knowledge of the zero-day market, confirms","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/android-spyware-malloc.jpg?resize=1200,751",2024-04-06 15:00:51,"Meta Description: Discover the surging costs of zero-day exploits and the challenges in uncovering them.

In response to recent concerns about a Snapchat feature known as ""Solar System,"" the company has decided to make adjustments to how it functions. This feature, which ranks paid subscribers based on their communication frequency with friends, has been accused of increasing anxiety among teenage users.

The Solar System feature organizes friends into a user's personal ""solar system,"" with friends who are contacted more frequently positioned closer, similar to planets orbiting the sun. This system can lead to hurt feelings when users realize they aren't as close to their friends as they thought. Acknowledging user feedback, Snapchat has addressed the issue without eliminating the feature entirely.

Snapchat announced that the Solar System feature will now be turned off by default for Snapchat+ subscribers. Users can still enable the feature if they choose, allowing them to know when they are close to someone in their network. The company hopes this change will strike a balance between providing a desired feature and avoiding upsetting those who do not wish to use it.

However, it is unclear whether turning off the feature by default will have the desired effect. Teens, who make up a significant portion of Snapchat's user base, may actively seek out the feature and re-enable it. Snapchat has noted that only a small percentage (less than 0.25%) of the community uses the Solar System option. Still, it is important to consider how many Snapchat+ users have engaged with the feature.

The Solar System feature is one of several friend ranking systems offered by Snapchat. Another feature, ""Best Friends,"" displays a user's most contacted friends at the top of their contact list, along with a heart or smiley emoji. Snapchat also offers ""Streaks,"" a tool that encourages repeated app use by displaying the number of consecutive days users have stayed in touch with one another.

Although Snapchat has promised to mitigate the potential downsides of online communication, it has intentionally created features that have left the company open to lawsuits and Congressional inquiry. Snapchat's defense of the Solar System feature is that users wanted more awareness and context about their friendships. However, critics argue that these features are designed to keep young people engaged with the app","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Evan-Spiegel-SnapDSC04002.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 23:38:52,"Meta Description: Snapchat adjusts ""Solar System"" feature to address user concerns - discover how Snapchat ranks friends and its impact on mental health.

Introduction

Autism, a complex neurodevelopmental condition, affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving the developmental outcomes of children with autism. EarliTec Diagnostics, an Atlanta-based startup, is revolutionizing the autism diagnosis landscape with its innovative, AI-driven system that helps clinicians diagnose children as young as 16 months old. This blog post will delve into the story behind EarliTec Diagnostics, its cutting-edge technology, and the growing interest in autism-focused healthcare startups from venture capitalists (VCs).

EarliTec Diagnostics: A Groundbreaking Approach to Autism Diagnosis

EarliTec Diagnostics' FDA-authorized system employs artificial intelligence to analyze a child's eye movements while they watch short videos and engage in social interactions on a screen for 12 minutes. The device tracks the child's eye movements, revealing distinct patterns between children with and without autism. By offering a faster, more efficient diagnosis method, EarliTec's technology enables clinicians to work with more children and provide earlier intervention, which significantly impacts a child's developmental trajectory.

Raising Capital for Expansion and Research

EarliTec Diagnostics recently secured a $21.5 million Series B funding round co-led by Nexus NeuroTech Ventures and Venture Investors. This investment will aid the company in expanding its commercialization efforts, enhancing its assessment and treatment options, and conducting research to potentially diagnose a wider age range of children. Currently, EarliTec's system is used by eight clinicians across six states, with plans to grow its user base and impact.

The Growing Momentum in Autism-Focused Healthcare Startups

The increased interest in autism-focused healthcare startups is evident through recent funding initiatives. For example, the Autism Impact Fund raised a $60 million fund, 20% higher than its initial target of $50 million.

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of venture capital, IVP's recent closing of its 18th fund with $1.6 billion in capital commitments is a notable achievement. I had the opportunity to speak with Eric Liaw, a longtime general partner at IVP, to discuss the fundraising process, succession, and portfolio companies, including the recent drama surrounding Klarna.

Fundraising in a Choppy Market

When asked about the fundraising process, Liaw described it as ""choppy,"" pointing out that the environment in 2018, when they raised their sixteenth fund, was significantly different from the one in 2021. Despite the challenges, IVP remained consistent in their approach, choosing not to raise an excessive amount of capital and deploy it quickly. This strategy has allowed them to maintain their focus and avoid the pitfalls experienced by some of their industry peers.

Expanding to Europe and the Klarna Drama

Liaw, who recently relocated to London, mentioned that IVP's expansion to Europe was an organic extension of their existing strategy. They made their first investment in Europe back in 2006 and have since built a portfolio of 20 companies across 10 different countries.

The Environmental Protection Agency has allocated $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations. This Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund aims to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar dispersed, targeting underfinanced climate tech projects and benefiting low-income communities.","Title: The New Green Bank: A Game-Changer for Climate Tech Investments

A significant development in the realm of climate technology financing has emerged in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently allocated $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations. These organizations will utilize the funds to provide loans, targeting underfinanced yet crucial projects, such as residential heat pump installations and affordable housing retrofits.

The newly established Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund aims to address the long-standing challenge of smaller-scale projects being overlooked by financial institutions due to lower profitability. Traditional banks have historically favored large-scale renewable energy projects, like utility-scale solar and wind farms. However, the demand for climate tech solutions at the residential and small business level remains high.

Dawn Lippert, CEO and founder of Elemental Excelerator, expressed her excitement to TechCrunch, stating, ""It's a chance to prove that this works and creates real benefit on the ground for people across America...tribal communities, rural communities, low-income and disadvantaged communities are really the focus here."" Indeed, over $14 billion of the funding will be directed towards these specific communities.

With the potential to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar dispersed, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could have a far-reaching impact. This multiplier effect might even surpass expectations, as McKinsey estimates the new green bank could draw more than $12 in private investment per dollar on its balance sheet.

Although the $20 billion fund may appear modest compared to the $27 trillion required for the U.S. to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (as per McKinsey's estimates), its capacity to stimulate private investment and serve as a recurring funding source offers the potential for extensive influence beyond its initial financial scope.

Startups and investors can also reap benefits from this new initiative. While the primary focus is on consumers and small businesses, equity investments are a possibility. The funding is expected to boost demand for ready-to-deploy climate technologies, while simultaneously sending a clear message to innovators and investors that there is a market for consumer-level climate tech tailored for low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Introduction

In a surprising turn of events, Tesla is gearing up to unveil its much-anticipated robotaxi on August 8, as announced by CEO Elon Musk, following reports that the automaker has shelved its plans to develop a low-cost electric vehicle (EV). This announcement comes after Reuters published an article stating that Tesla was abandoning its affordable EV project, which was expected to be priced around $25,000. Musk quickly dismissed the report, stating that Reuters was ""lying (again),"" but he did not specify which part of the article he was contesting.

The Core Announcement: Tesla's Robotaxi

Amidst the controversy, one thing is certain: Tesla is moving ahead with its robotaxi plans. Musk's tweet confirmed the August 8 unveiling, but he did not provide any further details about the upcoming robotaxi. The challenge lies in creating a robotaxi that can function effectively with Tesla's camera-only system, as the company removed radar and other sensors from its driver assistance technologies a few years ago. This is a bold move, considering that other robotaxi companies, such as Waymo, rely heavily on radar and lidar technologies for their autonomous vehicles.

Affordable EV: A Continuous Pursuit

Tesla has long been promising an affordable EV, with expectations that the vehicle would hit the market with a starting price of around $25,000. Musk himself expressed optimism about this model's arrival in the second half of 2025 during a Q4 2022 earnings call. However, the Reuters report suggests that the company has changed course, focusing its efforts solely on robotaxis.

In response to the report, Musk accused Reuters of lying, but he did not explicitly deny that the affordable EV project had been canceled. With Tesla's cheapest vehicle being the Model 3, which starts at $39,000, the market is still waiting for a more budget-friendly electric vehicle from the automaker.

Conclusion

As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of self-driving technology, questions surrounding the affordable EV remain unanswered. However, one thing is for sure: Tesla's commitment to revolutionizing transportation is stronger than ever. Stay tuned for more updates as the August 8 unveiling approaches.
