Neurotech wearables now monitored under expanded Colorado privacy law. Protecting brainwaves from tech companies' reach.","Title: Brainwave Privacy in the Age of Neurotech Wearables: A Call for Protection

In an era where technology is increasingly integrated with our biology, a new frontier of privacy concerns has emerged. Colorado recently took a significant step in addressing these issues by expanding its existing privacy law to include neural data, or brain activity. This addition signifies a growing recognition of the importance of protecting our brainwaves, which are now being collected and analyzed by a range of neurotech wearables.

Neural data, as defined by the Colorado bill, includes ""data generated by the technological processing, measurement, or analysis of an individual's neural properties, compositions, or activities or of an individual's body or bodily functions."" This expansive definition encompasses not only fingerprints and facial images but also brainwaves, which are measured using electroencephalography (EEG) methods and electrodes.

While invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) like Neuralink or Synchron are regulated under higher data protections due to their medical device status, non-invasive neurotech such as consumer wearables are not yet subject to any specific regulations. Companies like Emotiv and NeuroSky have been exploring EEG technology for fitness, digital health, and even perfume for nearly a decade. Today, an array of unregulated neurotech wearables is available, from headsets promising better athletic performance to headbands that assist with meditation. These devices track, analyze, and, in some cases, record brain activity, raising concerns about the potential misuse of this highly personal and sensitive data.

The Colorado legislation was spurred by growing concerns about privacy in consumer BCIs and the sensitive nature of neural data. Unprotected neural data could reveal intimate information about individuals, including health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive functioning. In the wrong hands, this data could be used against individuals by companies or third parties. A report from The Neurorights Foundation found that 29 out of 30 companies surveyed ""appear to have access to the consumer's neural data and provide no meaningful limitations to this access.""

In a troubling turn of events, Fisker, the electric vehicle (EV) startup, has announced plans for additional layoffs and cost-cutting measures in a desperate bid to stay afloat. The company is scrambling to raise funds to avoid bankruptcy, as revealed in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing.

Fisker's financial situation appears precarious, with only $54 million in cash and equivalents as of April 16, and an additional $11.2 million in restricted cash. The company is currently working to restructure its finances and pay off a loan with an outstanding balance of over $300 million to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.

The regulatory filing also indicated that Fisker had reduced its global workforce to 1,135 employees, down from 1,560 at the end of 2022, and around 1,300 at the end of September 2023. Moreover, the company plans to further decrease its physical footprint, signaling a significant downsizing effort.

These developments come on the heels of the departure of two members of Fisker's board of directors and the appointment of a Chief Restructuring Officer, who now has the sole authority to approve the company's budget and oversee any potential sale of Fisker's business.

At the core of Fisker's struggles is the problematic launch of its first electric vehicle, the Fisker Ocean SUV, which has faced numerous issues since its debut in June 2023. The Ocean has been plagued by software bugs, reports of sudden power loss and brake failure, and insufficient customer service.

These problems have contributed to Fisker's inability to meet internal sales goals, and the company has lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments for some of the vehicles it has sold. In response, Fisker has initiated an internal audit, recovering a majority of the missing funds, and has shifted its focus to a dealership model.

As a long-time Linux user, I've come to appreciate the unique strengths of this operating system. However, there's always room for improvement, and there are certain features from macOS that could significantly enhance the Linux user experience. Here are six areas where Linux could benefit from borrowing ideas from its Apple-flavored competitor.

1. Video and Audio Stacks

One of the most significant advantages of macOS is its robust video and audio stacks. The video playback on macOS is unparalleled, offering exceptional clarity and a clean, beautiful look right out of the box. Linux, on the other hand, often requires users to install third-party codecs to play various video formats. Moreover, even when videos do play, the quality isn't always as good as on macOS.

Similarly, the audio stack on macOS is more polished than its Linux counterpart. While Pipewire is a step in the right direction, Linux could still benefit from more plug-and-play technology in its audio stack, reducing the need for frequent restarts and ensuring compatibility with popular applications like Audacity.

2. Smooth Visual Experience

macOS is renowned for its smooth visual experience, with animations, videos, and window movements gliding effortlessly. Linux distributions still have some catching up to do in this regard, as they often lack the same level of graphical smoothness. Implementing more fluid visuals in Linux would undoubtedly enhance the overall user experience.

3. Reliable Multitouch Gestures

While some Linux distributions offer multitouch gesture support, it's often not as reliable or consistent as on macOS. Simple gestures like single-finger swipes for navigating web pages could make a significant difference in day-to-day usage.

4. Seamless Mobile-to-Desktop Integration

Apple has set the bar high in terms of mobile-to-desktop integration, with features like Handoff allowing users to start tasks on one device and continue on another. While tools like KDE Connect and GSConnect exist for Linux, they don't offer the same level of simplicity and feature range as Apple's solution.

5. Popular Applications

Introduction

In today's world, the demand for metal resources is ever-increasing, with countries like South Korea heavily dependent on imports. As a result, the concept of a circular economy, which focuses on recycling and reusing waste materials, has become increasingly important. This is particularly true for valuable metals like gold, which can be found in various electronic waste. A team of researchers from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), led by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi, has developed a groundbreaking technology that uses textile materials to selectively recover high-purity gold from electronic waste. This article explores the science behind this innovative technology and its potential impact on the circular economy.

The Challenge of Metal Recovery from Electronic Waste

Traditional adsorbents for metal recovery are typically granular in shape, offering high specific surface areas that enhance adsorption efficiency. However, they can be difficult to control underwater, resulting in low recovery rates and even secondary environmental pollution. On the other hand, fiber-like materials are more manageable underwater and can be shaped in various ways, making them ideal for industrial applications. Nevertheless, they often lack the necessary strength and durability for gold recovery processes, leading to breakage and reduced efficiency.

Innovative Solution: Aminated Polyacrylonitrile Fibers (ALPF)

To address these challenges, KIST researchers have developed a new type of adsorbent material called aminated polyacrylonitrile fibers (ALPF). By chemically immobilizing alkaline molecules on the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers, the team has significantly improved the molecular gold recovery performance and structural stability of these materials.

The ALPF has a dramatically larger surface area, enhancing the adsorption performance of gold ions (Au) in waste by up to 2.5 times (from 576 mg/g to 1,462 mg/g) compared to the team's previously developed granular gold adsorption material. This improvement is attributed to the presence of amine-containing polymer fibers, allowing the ALPF to effectively recover gold ions even in the presence of various coexisting metal ions.

","Title: A Neural Network-Based Solution to the Battle of Bandwidth?

The ongoing war between application data requirements and available network bandwidth has been one of the main challenges in the digital age. However, a new study by NJIT Associate Professor Jacob Chakareski and his team offers a promising solution: BONES (Buffer Occupancy-based Neural-Enhanced Streaming).

BONES is a system that makes network requests err on the side of smallness and upscales the difference through a neural network running on the receiving hardware. This system has been developed in collaboration with peers from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and will be presented at the ACM Sigmetrics conference in Venice, Italy this summer.

According to Chakareski, BONES has the potential to enhance the video streaming experience for users by increasing the quality-of-experience by 4% to 13% over state-of-the-art algorithms. It also addresses the latency constraints that have been a concern in previous approaches.

The BONES team has built a prototype, and their results are equally as good as those observed through simulations. They are also sharing their code and data in public, making it easier for others to replicate the study and contribute to the field.

The researchers are also working on a proof-of-concept application with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign on MiVirtualSeat: Semantics-Aware Content Distribution for Immersive Meeting Environments.

Chakareski hopes that popular video conferencing services may also adopt the method. ""Neural computation is becoming something. You hear a lot about machine learning in different domains, and this could be one more application where it could be used. We haven't thought about commercializing the technology, but this is certainly something that one could pursue, and we may pursue.""

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become an indispensable part of our daily lives, powering devices such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems. Traditional LIBs rely on high-concentration electrolytes, which are expensive and can be environmentally unfriendly due to their high lithium salt content. However, a team of researchers has developed an ultralow-concentration electrolyte that offers a more sustainable and cost-effective solution without compromising performance.

In a study published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, the research team, led by Jinliang Yuan, Lan Xia, and Xianyong Wu, introduced an innovative electrolyte, LiDFOB/EC-DMC, based on the lithium salt LiDFOB (lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate) and a commercial carbonate solvent, EC-DMC (ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate). This ultralow-concentration electrolyte, with only 2 weight percent salt content (0.16 mol/L), is significantly cheaper than conventional electrolytes, making it an attractive option for large-scale applications.

One of the primary challenges in developing ultralow-concentration electrolytes is their limited ionic conductivity, which can negatively impact battery performance. Surprisingly, the LiDFOB/EC-DMC electrolyte boasts a high ionic conductivity of 4.6 mS/cm, making it a viable alternative for LIBs. Its unique properties enable the formation of a robust, inorganic-dominated interphase layer on both LCO (lithium cobalt oxide) cathodes and graphite anodes, contributing to exceptional cycling stability in half and full cells.

In the pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability, smart windows have emerged as a promising technology, offering dynamic light control that can significantly reduce energy costs in large buildings. However, their widespread adoption has been hindered by high costs and other limiting factors. A recent study by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin aims to tackle these challenges by introducing a novel type of electrochromic device and materials, derived from common and low-cost natural polymer sources such as amylose, found in corn, potatoes, and beans.

The Power of Biomass Materials

Leveraging the unique properties of biomass materials, the research team, led by Professor Guihua Yu, has developed an innovative electrochromic device that boasts excellent optical properties, affordability, sustainability, and ease of preparation. This breakthrough could pave the way for the widespread use of smart windows, addressing the critical need for sustainable electrochromic materials and devices with exceptional properties.

The researchers demonstrated the ability to decrease or increase the amount of light the device transmitted by more than 85% and modulate its transmission of ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra by applying a low voltage. The technology proved resilient, withstanding more than six weeks of ultraviolet exposure, 1,200 cycles of use, and 4,000 switches between light permeability.

The Secret behind the Novel Electrochromic System

The key to this groundbreaking discovery lies in the electrical regulation of dynamic host-guest interactions between iodine and amylose. This novel electrochromic system is supported by simple and readily available materials, including a reusable, transparent electrode and the absence of metal ions or organic solvents.

A Growing Market for Smart Glass

The market for smart glass, which includes smart windows and displays, is projected to reach $12.7 billion by 2030. However, this growth is currently restrained by high costs, with smart windows costing up to 10 times as much as standard energy-efficient windows. Given that buildings account for 39% of energy consumption in the U.S., with 35% of that attributed to heating, vent",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/how-potatoes-corn-and.jpg,2024-04-23 10:10:02,"Dynamic Smart Windows: Harness Natural Polymers for Energy Efficiency - Up to 85% Light Modulation

Introduction

In today's interconnected world, reliable and fast Wi-Fi has become a necessity in both public and private spaces. However, wireless local-area networks (WLAN) based on IEEE802.11 standards often suffer from performance issues due to factors like user transmission rates and interference. A new study by researchers from Shibaura Institute of Technology and Nagoya University aims to address these challenges using game theory to optimize access point (AP) connection strategies.

The Impact of Users on AP Performance

When a new user joins a WLAN, their position, individual throughput, and interference can significantly affect the performance of the entire network. Slow users can lower the throughput rate of other users, while interference between users can further degrade performance. To minimize these effects, scientists have proposed various cooperative strategies that prompt users to change their position to improve system throughput.

Addressing Limitations with Game Theory

Existing techniques often fail to consider the interference between users and the possibility that some users may be fixed while others can move. To tackle these limitations, the research team developed a novel AP connection method using game theory. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with decision analysis in clearly defined frameworks, making it suitable for analyzing wireless communication environments with multiple users.

A Potential Game Approach

The researchers proposed a potential game model whose objective function is to maximize system throughput. This model consolidates the incentives for all users into a single function, considering the impact of new users joining a WLAN on existing users and accounting for inter-user interference.

Testing the Proposed AP Connection Strategy

The researchers tested their proposed AP connection strategy, which is directly based on the potential game model, by comparing it with previous AP connection methods. They analyzed the resulting AP throughput for each method in various scenarios involving different user positions. The results showed that the proposed strategy led to a throughput improvement compared to other techniques, with improvements in system performance reaching up to 6% in some cases.

Potential Applications

Though having a router prompt existing or new users to move around might not be feasible in every situation, the proposed strategy could be implemented in certain environments. For example, Wi-Fi services in classrooms and libraries could benefit from this approach due to their location-",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-winwin-approach-maxi.jpg,2024-04-22 15:57:43,"""Optimize Wi-Fi performance with game theory: Improve system throughput by 6% with our cooperative AP connection strategy.""

Introduction

Dating apps have become a ubiquitous part of our culture, promising to help users find love with just a few swipes. However, a new study by Mozilla reveals that these apps are collecting more data than ever, often at the expense of user privacy. In this blog post, we'll explore the key findings of the Mozilla report, focusing on the invasive practices of dating apps and their potential consequences.

The Mozilla Report: Key Findings

In 2021, Mozilla conducted a privacy review of 25 popular dating apps. The results were concerning, with 22 apps receiving the lowest grade - ""Privacy Not Included."" Only Lex, a queer-owned and operated app, received a positive review, while Harmony and Happn received passing grades.

The report highlighted that 80% of the apps may share or sell users' personal data for advertising purposes. For instance, Bumble's privacy clause is vague and could potentially sell user data to advertisers. Furthermore, the majority of apps, including Hinge, Tinder, OkCupid, Match, Plenty of Fish, BLK, and BlackPeopleMeet, collect precise geolocation data from users, even when the app is not in use.

The Insidious Role of Data Brokers

Dating apps argue that they collect vast amounts of data to provide better matches for users. However, when this data falls into the hands of data brokers, the consequences can be severe. Last year, a U.S.-based Catholic group purchased data from Grindr to monitor some members, highlighting the potential misuse of user data.

User Backlash and Market Trends

Despite the popularity of dating apps, downloads are slowing down, and user trust is waning. According to data from Pew Research, only three in ten adults have ever used a dating site or app, a figure that has remained constant since 2019. Furthermore, dating app giants Match Group and Bumble have lost over $40 billion in market value since 2021.

While AI has shown promise in creating still images based on textual descriptions, generating videos of human figures in motion based on language instructions has proven to be a more daunting challenge. A team of researchers from Beijing Institute of Technology, BIGAI, and Peking University has introduced a novel framework that addresses this issue, presenting their work at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024.

The researchers, Yixin Zhu, Siyuan Huang, and Wei Liang, built upon their previous generative model, HUMANIZE, to create a new framework capable of generating human motion in 3D scenes based on language input. This two-stage framework comprises an Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) and an Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM). The ADM predicts scene affordance maps from language descriptions, while the AMDM generates human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance map.

Scene affordance, which refers to the possibilities for interaction between an agent and its environment, plays a crucial role in the new framework. By incorporating scene affordance, the model can better understand the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, ultimately improving its generalization capabilities across diverse scene geometries. This approach also enhances the model's ability to create convincing motions with limited training data, as the affordance maps clearly delineate the regions associated with the user's descriptions or prompts.

The researchers' groundbreaking framework offers several advantages over previous approaches to language-guided human motion generation. The utilization of scene affordance enables the model to create more accurate and diverse motions, even in complex 3D environments. Furthermore, the framework's two-stage design allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in handling various language inputs and scene configurations.

This innovative model holds significant potential for various real-world applications. In the film industry, it could be used to create realistic animated films with AI-generated human motion. Additionally, the model could generate synthetic training data for robotics applications, aiding in the development of more advanced and responsive robotic systems.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-new-framework-to-gen.jpg,2024-04-23 06:40:01,"""Experience a breakthrough in human motion generation!
