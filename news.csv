Introduction

In a bold move to revolutionize the digital media landscape, Truth Social, the social media platform owned by Donald Trump's media company, recently revealed plans to launch a live TV streaming platform. This new venture aims to fill a gap in the market by focusing on ""news networks,"" ""religious channels,"" and ""family-friendly"" content while offering a safe haven for material discriminated against or censored by other platforms and services. Let's delve deeper into what this exciting innovation means for both creators and consumers.

Phased Rollout Strategy

The streaming service will unfold in three distinct stages. First, Truth Social intends to integrate its content delivery network (CDN) for streaming through the Truth Social app on Android, iOS, and the web. Following this initial step, the company will release over-the-top (""OTT"") streaming applications tailored for mobile devices, tablets, and various gadgets. Ultimately, Truth Social plans to debut a dedicated streaming application designed explicitly for television sets. With extensive testing already conducted on their web and iOS platforms for half a year, the company confidently declares they have completed the research and development stage.

Supporting Free Speech and Quality Content

Devin Nunes, the CEO of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), expressed his enthusiasm about the upcoming platform in the official press release:

""We're thrilled to embark on the subsequent significant phase for Truth Social. Our goal is to establish a premier destination where users can access top-tier news and entertainment often subjected to prejudice or outright bans elsewhere.""

This mission aligns perfectly with recent endeavors by Elon Musk's X to transform the popular social networking site into a bastion of free speech prioritizing video content. Currently hosting shows featuring former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and ex-Fox Sports host Jim Rome, X seeks to empower diverse voices and promote open dialogue. However, even figures like former CNN anchor Don Lemon aren't immune to unexpected cancellations, highlighting the need for alternative platforms that genuinely uphold freedom of expression.

Addressing Market Needs

As Truth Social goes public following the approval of a merger between TMTG and Digital World Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), questions surrounding profitability remain. Despite reporting a staggering net loss of approximately $49 million in 2023 and generating only marginally better revenues of nearly $4 million during the same period, there seems to be no shortage of user interest. According to data gathered by Appfigures and shared with TechCrunch, Truth Social boasts close to seven million total installs via the iOS App Store and Google Play combined â€“ an impressive figure indicative of substantial demand.

Conclusion

By providing a space for quality content frequently overlooked or marginalized by mainstream outlets, Truth Social's innovative approach promises to cater to underserved audiences craving authenticity and diversity. As the platform prepares for its multi-phased rollout strategy, anticipation builds among those eager to experience an inclusive and dynamic digital environment committed to fostering free speech and creativity without compromise.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/truth-social-trump.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-16 17:47:52,"""Discover Truth Social's Live TV Streaming Platform: Uncensored News Networks & Family-Friendly Entertainment!

New EPFL study finds LLMs like GPT-4 change opinions 81.7% more with personal info. Superhuman AI models pose a risk in spreading misleading narratives online.","Title: The Persuasive Power of AI: A New Era of Influence and Manipulation

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly pervasive, a new study from EPFL has shed light on the persuasive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The research demonstrates that individuals engaged in debates with LLMs, which have access to their personal information, are significantly more likely to change their opinions than those debating human counterparts.

""On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog."" This famous 1990s cartoon caption encapsulated the anonymity of the early web. Fast forward to the present day, and we might paraphrase it as, ""On the internet, nobody knows if you're a dog or an AI."" This observation was a driving force behind the EPFL study, which aimed to quantify the persuasive power of LLMs and understand their potential to disseminate misleading narratives online.

Associate Professor Robert West, head of the Data Science Lab in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, explained, ""The danger lies in superhuman AI models that can create tailor-made, convincing arguments to push false or misleading narratives online.""

Previous research has indicated that language models can generate content at least as persuasive as human-written messages, if not more so. However, there is limited knowledge regarding LLMs' persuasive abilities in direct conversations with humans and the role personalization plays in enhancing their performance.

The EPFL study aimed to address this knowledge gap by recruiting 820 participants for a controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned a topic and one of four treatment conditions: debating a human with or without personal information about the participant, or debating an AI chatbot (OpenAI's GPT-4) with or without personal information about the participant.

The results were staggering. Participants who debated GPT-4 with access to their personal information had 81.7% higher odds of increased agreement with their opponents compared to participants who debated humans. When personalization was not a factor, GPT-4 still outperformed humans, but the effect was less pronounced.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/apple-web-distribution-ios/,"Apple will now let users in the EU download apps through web sites, not just the App Store"," Apple Now Lets Users in EU Download Apps via Websites, Not Just App Store ","Title: A New Era of App Distribution in the EU: Goodbye App Store Monopoly, Hello Developer Freedom

Introduction

In a significant shift for the world of mobile applications, Apple recently announced that developers can now distribute iOS apps directly to users in the European Union (EU) via websites. This move comes as part of Apple's efforts to comply with the region's Digital Markets Act (DMA), aiming to promote competition and consumer protection. Let us delve deeper into what this transformation means for both developers and end-users.

A Massive Change in the Mobile Ecosystem

For years, Apple has maintained strict control over its App Store, allowing little room for alternative methods of app distribution. However, recent developments tied to the DMA require Apple to open up web distribution for iOS apps targeting EU users. Starting from Tuesday, developers meeting certain criteria can enable users to download their apps straight from their websites instead of going through the traditional App Store route.

Understanding the Changes and Requirements

To facilitate web distribution, Apple introduced a ""web distribution entitlement"" for iOS 17.5, granting developers greater autonomy when distributing their creations. To qualify, developers need to adhere to Apple's new EU business terms, among which is a novel ""core technology fee."" Charged at â‚¬0.50 for every first annual installation exceeding 1 million in the previous 12 months, irrespective of location, this fee applies exclusively to those using the DMA entitlements. Those preferring to stick with Apple's older terms cannot enjoy the benefits brought about by the DMA entitlements.

Key Criteria and Considerations for Web Distribution

Developers eager to embrace web distribution must fulfill several prerequisites, including maintaining good standing with Apple's developer program, handling intellectual property disputes and legal takedown requests, offering customer service for their apps, and ensuring compatibility with Apple's stringent notarization requirements designed to preserve platform security and integrity.

Addressing Security Concerns and User Authorization

While Apple acknowledges potential security concerns related to web distribution, it maintains that responsible implementation can alleviate many associated risks. In essence, the first time an iOS user tries to download an app from a developer's website, they must approve the developer to install apps directly onto their deviceâ€”a process requiring explicit verification through multiple steps and confirmation prompts. Subsequent downloads become faster after successful initial authorization.

Balancing Platform Integrity and Developer Autonomy

Although Apple insists on applying necessary precautions to safeguard its users, skeptics accuse the company of exploiting scare tactics to discourage users from exploring alternatives beyond the App Store. As investigations scrutinizing various aspects of Apple's DMA compliance unfold, it remains crucial to strike an optimal balance between platform integrity and fostering healthy competition driven by enhanced developer freedom.

Conclusion

This watershed moment signals a colossal change for app distribution norms across the EU, empowering developers and enriching user experiences. By embracing web distribution and promoting fairer practices, Apple demonstrates commitment towards evolving regulatory standards and enhances overall trust in digital markets. While challenges persist, this landmark decision marks a step forward in the right direction, bolstering innovation, competition, and growth throughout the thriving realm of mobile applications.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-16 17:00:02,"Meta Description: Discover how the EU's Digital Markets Act impacts iOS app distribution!

Introduction

In recent years, the surge of significant new AI models has been more prevalent in the industry than in academia and government. According to the seventh-annual report on the global state of artificial intelligence by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), there are growing concerns about the technology's escalating costs and the poor measurement of its risks. This article will delve into these issues, focusing on the training costs of large language models and the lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.

The Rising Cost of Training Large Language Models

The cost of training large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 has reached unprecedented levels. For instance, GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute, while Google's Gemini Ultra cost approximately $191 million for compute. These so-called foundation models serve as the backbone for developing other AI programs, and their training costs have been increasing significantly in recent years.

One of the key drivers of these rising costs is the increasing size of computation required for large AI models. For example, the original Google Transformer required about 10,000 petaFLOPs (10,000 trillion floating point operations), while the more recent Gemini Ultra approaches a hundred billion petaFLOPs. As a result, training costs have skyrocketed, with models like RoBERTa Large, released in 2019, costing around $160,000 to train, compared to the original Transformer model, which cost around $900 in 2017.

The Lack of Standardization in Responsible AI Reporting

While assessing AI programs for safety, including transparency, explainability, and data privacy, is crucial, there is a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting.

Introduction

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, hosts not only a colossal black hole at its heart but also countless smaller stellar black holes formed due to the collapse of massive stars. While researchers estimate approximately 100 million such black holes reside within the Milky Way, many remain undiscovered. Recent developments bring us closer to understanding these elusive entities, thanks to the detection of a remarkably large stellar black hole named Gaia BH3. Let's delve into this fascinating discovery and explore its implications.

Unearthing Gaia BH3

Initially detected through the European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia mission, which meticulously gathers data concerning celestial objects, Gaia BH3 stood out owing to its proximity and considerable mass. Situated roughly 1,926 light-years away, it ranks among the two nearest identified black holes to Earth. Researchers initially pinpointed the presence of this sizable object upon observing peculiar movements exhibited by an aged red giant star located in the neighboring Aquila constellation. These erratic motions were ultimately attributed to the gravitational pull exerted by an enormous invisible entityâ€”now recognized as Gaia BH3.

Despite its relative closeness, detecting Gaia BH3 proved challenging; without sufficient surrounding material to generate X-rays, locating it using conventional means posed difficulties. However, utilizing data gathered by ground-based facilities like the European Southern Observatory enabled experts to validate both its existence and impressive dimensions. Preliminary research indicates that the companion star accompanying Gaia BH3 contains minimal heavy elements beyond hydrogen and helium, suggesting the possibility that its progenitor star shared a similar composition prior to its demise and subsequent formation of the black hole.

Implications of Gaia BH3

This monumental finding holds substantial significance for astronomers and astrophysicists alike, shedding new light on the relationship between certain types of stars and the creation of massive black holes. Specifically, low-metallicity stars, characterized by reduced quantities of heavier elements, have historically been associated with the potential to yield high-mass black holes following their collapse. With fewer opportunities for mass loss throughout their lifetime, these ancient giants retain ample raw materials necessary to produce colossal black holes.

Gaia BH3 offers compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis, thereby solidifying earlier theoretical predictions regarding the correlation between diminished metallicity and the generation of immense stellar black holes. Furthermore, the discovery highlights distinctions in developmental patterns observed between older and younger giant stars inhabiting our galaxy. As a result, researchers expect forthcoming explorations focusing on binary systems and stellar black holes to rely heavily on data derived from Gaia BH3 and its partnering star.

Conclusion

Undoubtedly, the unearthing of Gaia BH3 marks a significant milestone in uncovering the secrets shrouding stellar black holes. Its sheer magnitude challenges previous conceptions while providing valuable insights into the intricate processes governing the evolution of stars and black holes.

Introduction

A team of enterprising engineering students at the University of Bath has achieved a remarkable milestone. They have successfully constructed and run the world's first hydrogen-fueled engine built by undergraduates. This pioneering effort marks a significant step forward in the quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions.

The First Hydrogen-Powered Engine

In March, the Bath Hydrogen team fired up their prototype engine for the first time, marking a successful maiden run on the initial attempt. This achievement makes them the world's first undergraduate students to develop and operate a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine, known as an 'H2 ICE'. Notably, no hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine is currently available commercially, although major automotive manufacturers are investing in this technology's development.

The Journey to Success

Bath Hydrogen technical lead, Nicholas Burt, expressed his delight at the engine's first start, acknowledging the hard work that led to this validation. The team is currently using a test bed and preparing to adapt the engine for their record-attempt vehicle. The project began as a group business design project, with the team members having no prior knowledge of hydrogen fuel or engine construction.

Tesla has recently made several changes to its sales and delivery system, including ending discounts on its electric vehicle lineup across the United States. The decision to stop offering discounts on the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X was announced by CEO Elon Musk on his social media platform, X, in response to a comment from another user.

This announcement came after thousands of Tesla employees lost their jobs, with over 14,000 people being affected. According to TechCrunch, the layoffs were caused by poor financial performance. The company has also removed many job listings from its North America careers page, indicating a possible hiring freeze.

Rohan Patel, Tesla's former VP of Public Policy and Business Development, and Drew Baglino, Tesla's former SVP of Powertrain and Energy, also left the company this week. This represents a significant loss of talent for the company.

In addition to the price cuts on Tesla vehicles, the company also announced that it would be dropping the monthly subscription cost of its Supervised Full Self-Driving software to $99 from $199. This decision comes after several months of price cuts on various models, including the Model Y, which saw a nearly 20% drop in price.

While these price cuts may have helped Tesla sell more vehicles, the company's margins have shrunk. In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla's delivery numbers also fell year-over-year. The company built more cars than it shipped, which may indicate an area where they will renew their focus this year.

Tesla has received a lot of credit for its direct-sales model, which allows for greater control over the customer experience. However, beyond the initial purchase, Tesla has always been making changes to its sales and delivery strategy.

In late 2018, Musk announced that Tesla had bought an undisclosed number of trucking companies to ship increasing numbers of Model 3 sedans. In early 2019, Musk abruptly announced that Tesla would close many of its retail stores and lay off workers ""to achieve the savings required to provide [the Model 3] and be financially sustainable."" Less than two months later, the company reversed course. More recently, Tesla announced that its typical end-of-quarter scramble to make and ship as many cars as possible was becoming increasingly difficult. Tesla said it was working to smooth out this process, but the company is still facing quarterly bottlenecks.

Overall, Tesla's sales and delivery changes suggest that the company is facing challenges in maintaining profitability while also competing in a rapidly evolving market. It remains to be seen how these changes will impact the company's long-term success.
