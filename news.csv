A little over a year ago, Post News emerged as a new player in the microblogging scene, riding the wave of curiosity and debate following Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition. However, its journey has come to an end as founder Noam Bardin announced its closure last week. In this blog post, we'll delve into the strategy that drove Post News and examine the factors that led to its downfall.

Post News: A Promising Venture

Post News aimed to capitalize on Twitter's reputation as a virtual watering hole for journalists, offering a fresh platform for publishers and writers to monetize their content. The site's unique approach allowed users to purchase individual articles from partner outlets instead of subscribing to multiple publications. This strategy distinguished Post News from its competitors, positioning it as a potential disruptor in the digital news landscape.

Additionally, Post News enabled users to tip writers for their work, further promoting the monetization of quality content. The platform validated theories around micropayments and demonstrated consumers' willingness to purchase individual articles, highlighting a shift in the way digital news outlets could generate revenue.

The Rise and Fall of Post News

Despite its innovative strategy, Post News struggled to gain traction and become a significant platform. Founder Noam Bardin, who previously served as CEO of Waze, attributed the platform's failure to insufficient consumer adoption, acknowledging that a consumer business needs to demonstrate rapid growth to succeed.

Post News was backed by prominent investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Scott Galloway, an NYU professor and tech commentator. Notable figures like Kara Swisher, a Silicon Valley journalist, even served as advisors to the company. However, the platform never disclosed its funding details, leaving many to wonder about its financial situation.

Introduction

As India gears up for the colossal undertaking of the world's most extensive democratic exercise, concerns loom over the integrity of information exchanged between voters, politicians, and stakeholders. With greater internet penetration and increasingly sophisticated tools to generate false or misleading narratives, this year's general election faces unique challenges compared to those of 2019. This article explores the evolving nature of misinformation plaguing India's electoral process and potential solutions to combat this issue head-on.

A Surge in Online Misinformation

Since the last general election in 2019, India has witnessed exponential growth in both internet usage and social media engagement—now boasting over 830 million internet subscribers and ranking as the second-largest market for Facebook and Instagram users worldwide. Unfortunately, this expanded connectivity comes hand in hand with a heightened vulnerability to misinformation campaigns designed to sway opinions and sow discord among various demographics. As per the World Economic Forum, India ranks high in terms of susceptibility to misinformation and disinformation risks due to its expansive population, linguistic diversity, and cultural complexity.

Artificial intelligence technology, specifically deepfake production using generative AI, compounds the challenge posed by traditional forms of misinformation. These synthetic media creations often blur the lines between reality and fabrication, making them potent weapons capable of shaping public opinion and inciting real-world harm if left unchecked.

Deadly Consequences and Divisive Polarization

While misinformation undermines free and fair elections, it also bears dire consequences beyond the polling booths. Spreading misleading content can lead to physical violence against marginalized communities and amplify existing societal divisions. In recent times, instances of targeted misinformation aimed at inflaming religious and ethnic tensions have become alarmingly commonplace.

According to Pratik Sinha, Co-Founder of Indian fact-checking organization Alt News, misinformation serves as a tool wielded by malicious actors seeking to exploit societal fissures for personal gain. Social media platforms facilitate the rapid dissemination of deceptive content tailor-made to fuel polarizing sentiments amongst diverse audiences.

Language Barriers and Complexities

Another hurdle faced by fact-checkers stems from India's rich linguistic heritage and multifaceted socio-cultural mosaic. Verifying information across hundreds of dialects complicates efforts to identify and flag fraudulent material while ensuring minimal intrusion upon freedom of speech and expression.

Angie Drobnic Holan, Director of the International Fact-Checking Network, emphasizes the distinctive characteristics of India's informational ecosystem, stating, ""when you have a lot of misinformation, you have a great demand for fact-checking."" She highlights the added layer of complexity introduced by India's numerous regional languages, explaining that addressing misinformation requires robust collaboration between local and national fact-checking initiatives.

Government Regulations and Enforcement

To tackle the growing menace of misinformation, the Indian government amended its IT Intermediary Rules in 2022. These modifications mandate social media firms to delete misleading content within 72 hours of receiving reports. Nevertheless, questions persist regarding effective implementation and consistent application of these guidelines. Critics contend that ambiguous phrasing allows for arbitrary interpretation, potentially infringing upon individual liberties enshrined within India's constitutional framework.

Digital Advocacy Groups Sound Alarm Bells

Despite Google and Meta announcing restrictions on misleading content and AI bot involvement during Indian elections, skepticism remains regarding their commitment to combatting false narratives. Recent decisions, such as cutting funds to WhatsApp-based fact-checking projects mere weeks prior to the election, raise doubts about tech giants' sincerity towards safeguarding electoral integrity.

Additionally, doctored videos featuring celebrities endorsing specific parties and falsified updates pertaining to the Model Code of Conduct have flooded social media platforms ahead of the election. Hamsini Hariharan, Subject Matter Expert at U.K.-based fact-checking firm Logically, warns of cheapfakes—content produced via unsophisticated methods of image, video, and audio tampering—rapidly spreading across popular networks.

United Front Against Misinformation

Recognizing the urgency of this crisis, eleven civil society organizations recently petitioned India's Election Commission to enforce stricter penalties on politicians and social media entities involved in propagating distorted information. Bolstering collaborative efforts between government bodies, tech corporations, and independent fact-checkers emerges as a critical step toward preserving the sanctity of India's electoral processes amid escalating threats of deepfakes and cheapfakes.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/india-election-2024-getty.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-20 12:00:27,Protect democracy!
