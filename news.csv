In a surprising move, Amazon has confirmed the termination of its Prime Air drone delivery operations in Lockeford, California. This Central California town of 3,500 residents was the company's second U.S. drone delivery site, following College Station, Texas. The decision comes just months after the initial announcement of the Lockeford site in June 2022.

Amazon's Statement and Future Plans

Amazon released a statement regarding the Lockeford setback, expressing gratitude to the community for their support and providing assurance that current employees will be offered opportunities at other sites. The company also mentioned its intentions to continue serving Lockeford customers using alternative delivery methods. College Station deliveries will carry on as planned, and a new site in Tolleson, Arizona, is set to begin operations later this year.

The Impact on Tolleson and Future Expansion

Tolleson, a city with a population of just over 7,000, is located in Maricopa County, within the western portion of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Prime Air's arrival in Tolleson will bring same-day deliveries to Amazon customers in the region, utilizing a hybrid fulfillment center/delivery station. Although specific timing has not been provided, the company intends to contact impacted customers once the service is active.

Expansion of the drone delivery offering has been sluggish, partly due to regulatory hurdles. Amazon's Tolleson site is expected to be the sole expansion this year, with further news postponed until 2025. It remains uncertain whether the company will re-engage with California locales in the future.

Amazon's Commitment to Drone Delivery Technology

Despite the Lockeford setback, Amazon reaffirmed its commitment to drone delivery technology late last year by announcing medication deliveries in College Station. This initiative brings select Amazon Pharmacy orders to customers in less than an hour.

Local Governments and Technological Innovation

Select local governments view these types of deals as an opportunity to showcase their openness to technological innovation, often positioning themselves as alternatives to traditional hot spots like San Francisco or New York.

Pomelo, a groundbreaking startup that combines international money transfers with credit, has recently secured $35 million in a Series A funding round led by Dubai venture firm Vy Capital. This new round brings the total equity capital raised to $55 million, with an additional $125 million for its warehouse facility. This article will delve into the unique aspects of Pomelo and what sets it apart from other remittance services.

A Fresh Approach to Remittance Transfers

Pomelo has created a remittance product built on credit card rails, allowing users to send money internationally while simultaneously enhancing their credit scores. The company has partnered with Mastercard to develop a ""send now, pay later"" (SNPL) product category, offering faster transactions with no transfer fees compared to traditional cross-border money movement.

The startup's unique approach addresses several pain points for users, including instant access to funds, fraud and chargeback protection, and transaction history for building credit scores. Pomelo charges a late fee if the user cannot pay, ensuring there is no interest on the product. The primary revenue streams for the company are interchange revenue, and foreign exchange serves as a smaller component.

Expanding Payment Options and Reach

Since its launch in 2022, Pomelo has continually added new payment options, including the ability to send funds to GCash, a popular e-wallet in the Philippines that functions similarly to Venmo in the U.S. This feature is particularly important in the Philippines, where proof of ability to pay may be required before medical treatment.

Introduction

In today's digital age, Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots have become an integral part of our lives. From Google's AI assistant in Workspace to ChatGPT and Copilot, these tools can help us accomplish a variety of tasks. However, to harness their full potential, you need to master the art of AI prompting. In this blog, we will explore Google's new blog series that offers tips, tricks, and suggestions on how to get the most out of AI chatbots, with a particular focus on Gemini for Google Workspace.

The Importance of Prompts

A prompt is essentially a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. It is crucial in setting the context and guiding the AI chatbot to generate the desired output. Google emphasizes the importance of writing effective prompts to fully leverage the benefits of generative AI.

The Prompt Formula

Google proposes a four-part formula for building prompts: persona, task, context, and format. 

1. Persona: This refers to who is asking for the information. It could be you, a team member, a customer, or any other relevant party.
2. Task: This is what you want the chatbot to do. It could be providing information, generating ideas, drafting emails, or any other task.
3. Context: This is any additional information that could help the AI chatbot carry out the task. It could include the industry, the specific project, or any other relevant details.
4. Format: This is how you want the output to be structured. It could be a bullet-point list, a paragraph, a detailed report, or any other format.

This formula encourages you to include as much detail as possible, which is key to getting the best results when using AI chatbots.

Google's Prompting Guide 101

If you're eager to dive into writing effective prompts right away, Google has shared a ""Prompting guide 101"" ebook. This 45-page guide provides general advice on writing effective prompts and includes prompt examples for specific working professionals' roles. While the ebook is geared towards Gemini in Google Workspace users, the advice and prompts have general applications across platforms.

Oura's Smart Ring Makes Its Debut in Target Stores: A New Era of Health Tracking

In a significant development for the wearable technology industry, Oura recently announced that its smart ring would be available in select Target stores across the United States. This move follows similar announcements with Amazon in March and Best Buy last April, further solidifying Oura's retail presence and bolstering its reputation as a legitimate alternative to traditional wrist-worn smartwatches and trackers.

The Road to Retail: A Strategic Shift

The decision to increase Oura's retail presence is part of a broader strategic shift that began when Tom Hale took over as CEO in 2022. As interest in health trackers surged during the pandemic, Hale recognized the potential of the smart ring form factor and made retail expansion a priority. The NBA's high-profile adoption of Oura's health tracking technology and the company's one-millionth ring sale in March 2022 further validated this approach.

A Unique In-store Experience: Target's Sizing Solution

To facilitate a seamless shopping experience, Target stores will feature a unique in-store sizing experience for customers. Dummy units will be on display, allowing potential buyers to try on the rings for size. For those who prefer to size their fingers at home, Target offers a $10 sizing kit through its website. Purchasing this kit will result in a $10 gift certificate being sent along to offset the cost.

Pricing and Subscription Model

The Gen 3 rings start at $300, but Oura's subscription service is where the company generates substantial revenue. While the monthly fee for accessing certain features initially faced some criticism, it hasn't seemed to negatively impact Oura's growth.

Samsung's Galaxy Ring: Further Validation for the Form Factor

In addition to Oura's success, the smart ring form factor received further validation earlier this year when Samsung announced the launch of its own fitness ring, the Galaxy Ring. Set to hit the market later in 2023, the Galaxy Ring will contribute to the growing popularity and acceptance of smart rings as a viable health tracking option.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/cisa-chirp-systems-remotely-unlock-smart-locks/,US government says security flaw in Chirp Systems' app lets anyone remotely control smart home locks, Severe Security Flaw in RealPage-Owned Chirp App Exposes Smart Locks to Remote Control ,"Title: Unresolved Security Flaw in Smart Access Control System: A Call for Action

A significant vulnerability has been discovered in a smart access control system used by thousands of rental homes across the U.S. This system, developed by Chirp Systems, contains a flaw that allows anyone to manipulate any connected lock remotely. Despite being informed of the issue, Chirp has yet to address the problem, leaving countless homes and residents at risk.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently issued a security advisory highlighting the issue. The agency states that the phone apps designed by Chirp, which residents use to access their homes, ""improperly stores"" hardcoded credentials. These credentials enable unauthorized individuals to remotely lock or unlock Chirp-connected door locks over the internet.

Hardcoding credentials in apps poses a security risk, as anyone can extract and use them to impersonate the app and perform malicious actions. In this instance, the credentials allow for unauthorized physical access to smart locks connected to Chirp smart home systems. CISA has given the vulnerability a severity score of 9.1 out of 10, emphasizing its potential for severe consequences.

Despite multiple notifications from a security researcher and CISA, Chirp Systems has not responded, leaving the vulnerability unaddressed. This raises concerns about accountability in the property tech space, where an increasing number of companies provide keyless access controls integrated with smart home technologies to rental giants.

One such rental giant, Camden Property Trust, signed a deal with Chirp in 2020 to install Chirp-connected smart locks in over 50,000 units across more than a hundred properties. It remains unclear whether affected properties, including Camden, are aware of the vulnerability or have taken any action to protect their residents.

Chirp Systems was acquired by RealPage in 2020, which was subsequently acquired by Thoma Bravo later that year in a $10.2 billion deal. RealPage is currently facing legal challenges over allegations that its rent-setting software uses secret and proprietary algorithms to help landlords charge the highest possible rents. Neither RealPage nor Thoma Bravo have acknowledged the software vulnerabilities or addressed potential security risks to affected residents.

AlmaLinux, a reliable and secure operating system, has recently released its latest beta version, 9.4. This article will explore AlmaLinux's capabilities as a server and desktop operating system, focusing on its key features, security, and stability.

AlmaLinux: The Server Operating System

AlmaLinux 9.4 beta is a point release that mainly introduces package updates, such as Python 3.1, Ruby 3.3, PHP 8.2, NGINX 1.24, MariaDB 10.11, PostgreSQL 16, Git 2.43.0, LFS 3.4.1, and more. Additionally, there are updates to security systems, including SELinux userspace 3.6 with deny rules for enhanced customization, OpenSSL TLS toolkit with a drop-in directory for provider-specific configuration files, and new tools and options for the Linux kernel cryptographic API. Several device drivers have also been updated to re-add PCI IDs for previously disabled hardware.

Upgrading to AlmaLinux 9.4 beta can be done using the following three commands:

Although AlmaLinux is primarily designed for server use, there are valid reasons to consider it as a desktop operating system. Here are three benefits of using AlmaLinux as a desktop OS:

1. Long-term support: AlmaLinux 9.x is supported until 2032, offering an impressive 10 years of support.

2. Security: Server operating systems generally provide better security than their desktop counterparts. AlmaLinux, as a secure operating system, can offer a highly secure desktop experience as well.

In the ever-evolving world of Google Drive, the tech giant has recently brought new filtering options to its Android platform. Following the introduction of these features on Google Drive for iOS, Android users can now enjoy the same convenient functionality, as reported by Android Police. These new filters significantly improve the search experience, making it effortless to locate your files with ease.

Google Drive's updated filters allow you to sort files based on Type, People, and Modified dates. With the Type drop-down, you can select any file type found in Google Drive, including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, forms, photos, PDFs, videos, shortcuts, folders, and more. This feature is particularly useful when looking for specific file formats.

The People filter is another helpful addition, enabling you to search by contact name. This feature includes file owners and associated individuals such as editors and viewers. With the Modified filter, you can narrow down your search according to time frames, like today, the past 7 days, 30 days, this year, or last year. Moreover, custom dates are also available, offering even greater flexibility.

In comparison to the web version of Google Drive, the Android filters are slightly less comprehensive, lacking advanced search features like ""has the words,"" ""location,"" ""shared to,"" and ""follow-ups."" Nevertheless, the new filters offer a significant improvement over previous search capabilities.

A notable benefit of the new filters is their real-time updating feature. Users can see the results instantly on the screen as they toggle through different filter options. No need to apply the filters manually, as the results will dynamically update as you make your choices.

To access the new filters, ensure you have Google Drive version 2.24.147.0 or later. If you don't see the filters after tapping the Search bar in Google Drive, visit the Google Play Store and check for any available updates.

A recent wave of excitement swept through the tech world when whispers about Salesforce acquiring Informatica began to circulate. The potential deal, estimated to be somewhere between the $6.5 billion MuleSoft acquisition in 2018 and the $15.7 billion Tableau acquisition in 2019, would have been significant. However, the rumors were laid to rest as Informatica announced that it was not for sale, putting an end to the speculation.

Informatica's Declaration of Independence

On Monday, Informatica officially announced that it was not involved in any acquisition discussions. This announcement came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Informatica was in advanced talks to be acquired, based on sources familiar with the matter. The company's decision to issue a public statement is unusual, but it emphasizes Informatica's commitment to remaining an independent entity.

A Curious Pairing

Acquisition rumors often spark curiosity and debate, and the potential Informatica-Salesforce pairing was no exception. According to Constellation's Ray Wang, the acquisition didn't seem like a natural fit. ""The potential acquisition of Informatica is quite curious as the client base and tech is not cutting-edge. Although it could potentially solve a data integration challenge that Salesforce has had, Data Cloud is already a strong offering, so I'm not sure if this deal makes sense.""

Salesforce's Reserved Response

True to form, Salesforce refrained from commenting on the rumors and speculation. The company has a long-standing policy of not addressing market rumors or media speculation.

Looking Ahead

With the rumors put to rest, both Informatica and Salesforce can now focus on their respective growth strategies. The tech industry will continue to buzz with speculation and anticipation, but one thing is certain: Informatica is not for sale, at least not for now.

In conclusion, the Informatica-Salesforce acquisition rumor serves as a reminder that not all rumors lead to actual deals. As tech companies grow and evolve, so too will the market whispers that accompany them.

Introduction

How well do artificial intelligence (AI) tools write code? This question has been a subject of interest for some time, particularly for programmers looking to save time. In this article, we put various AI tools to the test, evaluating their performance in coding tasks. We will compare Meta AI to other AI chatbots, examining their abilities in writing WordPress plugins, rewriting string functions, finding bugs, and writing scripts.

1. Writing a WordPress Plugin

The first test is writing a basic WordPress plugin, which evaluates the AI chatbot's ability to perform web development using PHP and build a user interface. We compared Meta AI's interface with ChatGPT's interface. Although both AI chatbots generated the required fields, ChatGPT's presentation was cleaner, included headings, and placed the Randomize button more appropriately. Unfortunately, Meta AI displayed the ""White Screen of Death,"" while ChatGPT operated as expected.

Aggregate results:

- Meta AI: Interface - adequate, Functionality - fail
- ChatGPT: Interface - good, Functionality - good

2. Rewriting a String Function

The second test evaluates how an AI chatbot updates a utility function for better functionality. Meta AI had issues with correct values, handling multiple decimal points, processing dollar amounts with less than two decimals, and formatting numbers. These problems should be easily manageable for first-year computer science students, making Meta AI's failure disappointing.

Aggregate results:

- Meta AI: Failed
- Meta Code Llama: Succeeded
- ChatGPT: Succeeded

3. Finding an Annoying Bug

The third test involves identifying and recommending a fix for a bug in pre-existing code. Meta AI passed this test, demonstrating deep knowledge of the WordPress API and understanding of the program's interplay.

In the modern world, connectivity has become a necessity, with people relying heavily on Wi-Fi in public and private spaces. However, wireless local-area networks (WLANs) based on IEEE802.11 standards often suffer from performance issues due to factors like user transmission rates and interference. To tackle this challenge, a team of researchers, including Associate Professor Sumiko Miyata from Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT), has developed an innovative access point (AP) connection strategy using game theory.

The Problem with Traditional WLANs

When a new user joins a WLAN, their position, individual throughput, and interference can significantly impact the network's performance. Slow users can affect the throughput rate of others, while user interference can further degrade performance. Although researchers have proposed various strategies to minimize these problems, many of them fail to consider the interference between users and their transmission rates simultaneously. Additionally, some techniques overlook the fact that some users may be stationary while others can move.

Introducing Game Theory to WLANs

Game theory, a branch of mathematics focusing on decision analysis, offers a promising solution for improving WLAN performance. In this context, game theory can be used to analyze decision-making within clearly defined frameworks, helping identify optimal strategies for wireless communication environments with multiple users.

The SIT-led research team developed a potential game model to determine the user position that maximizes system throughput. This model consolidates the incentives for all users into a single function, allowing for the consideration of the impact of new users joining a WLAN on existing users. Moreover, the new approach takes into account inter-user interference by calculating the probabilities of packet collisions.

Testing the Proposed AP Connection Strategy

The researchers compared their proposed AP connection strategy, based on the potential game model, with previous AP connection methods. They analyzed the AP throughput for each method in various scenarios involving different user positions. The results demonstrated that the proposed strategy led to a throughput improvement compared to other techniques, with the improvement in system performance reaching up to 6% in some cases.

Potential Applications and Future Prospects

Although prompting users to move around may not be feasible in every situation, the proposed strategy could be beneficial in specific environments.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-winwin-approach-maxi.jpg,2024-04-22 15:57:43,Optimize your Wi-Fi with game theory: Improve performance by 6% with our innovative AP connection strategy - learn more!, WiFi Optimization ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction:
Smartphone manufacturers and mobile carriers often join forces, offering deals that seem too good to be true. These partnerships, however, are not driven by generosity but by business objectives. Discounts and promotions can be riddled with complexities and hidden costs. This post will guide you through the maze of smartphone deals, helping you make informed decisions.

The Deceptive Nature of Smartphone Deals:
The primary goal of mobile carriers is to make a profit. The discounts and promotions they offer are carefully calculated to ensure they benefit from the deal. Therefore, it's crucial to approach these offers with a healthy dose of skepticism and a keen eye for detail.

A Real-World Example:
Let's consider the case of upgrading from an iPhone 12 Pro Max to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latest model retails at $1399. A quick glance at the trade-in values offered by Apple's partners might lead you to believe that you're getting a great deal. However, the reality is different.

The Catch in the Fine Print:
The fine print often reveals that to qualify for the full discount, you must connect on an 'eligible rate plan.' These plans are usually the most expensive unlimited plans the carriers offer. Consequently, the monthly payments quoted in the deals only cover the device cost. The actual monthly bill includes the wireless service plan, which can significantly increase the overall cost.

The True Cost of Smartphone Deals:
To illustrate, let's compare the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro Max over three years at different carriers. At Verizon, the total cost would be $2919, while at AT&T, it would be $1851. These figures might seem shocking, but they result from the high monthly payments required for the wireless service plan to qualify for the discount.

Conclusion:
While smartphone deals can be tempting, it's essential to read the fine print and understand the true cost. The most discounted device might end up costing more due to the expensive wireless service plans. Therefore, before jumping on a 'too good to be true' deal, consider the long-term financial implications. Remember, the best deal is not always",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d902f250674fb4e74bf2e9a4ca1017baa12731eb/2024/04/22/ae8a47c8-bc55-4a37-a81e-05c4458dd8f9/gettyimages-1569269793.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-22 00:00:00,"""Uncover the true cost of 'free phone' deals.

Introduction

The Linux kernel, the heart of the Linux operating system, is constantly evolving, with new versions and updates being released regularly. To stay updated on the latest developments, subscribing to the Linux Kernel Mailing List or Linux Weekly News (LWN) is recommended. However, for a broad, quick overview of the state of the Linux kernel, attending a state-of-the-kernel presentation by Jonathan Corbet, Linux kernel developer and LWN editor-in-chief, is an excellent option.

The Calm and Steady Linux Kernel

At the Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, Corbet reported that everything is ""calm and steady and boring"" with the next kernel, Linux 6.9. This is good news, as a stable and secure kernel is essential for the smooth operation of the Linux operating system.

The Unique Vulnerabilities of the Linux Kernel

Despite the calmness, there is some concerning news. Corbet explained that ""just about any bug, if you're clever enough, can be exploitable to compromise the system."" The kernel is in a unique spot in the system, and it turns a lot of ordinary bugs into vulnerabilities. This situation is underlined by Linux kernel developers recently starting to issue their own Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) notifications.

Ensuring the Safety and Security of Linux Systems

To ensure the safety and security of Linux systems, Corbet recommended making sure your distribution runs long-term stable (LTS) kernel releases. These releases have fixed CVEs, and as new issues are patched, they're ported into the LTS kernels. However, it should be noted that LTS releases are now supported for only two years, not six, as was the case previously.
