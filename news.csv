https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/security-engineer-jailed-for-3-years-for-12m-crypto-hacks/,Security engineer jailed for 3 years for $12M crypto hacks, Cybersecurity Engineer Jailed for $12M Crypto Hacks: A White Hat Gone Wrong ,"Title: A Cybersecurity Engineer's Fall from Grace: Stealing Millions in Cryptocurrency

A once-renowned cybersecurity engineer, Shakeeb Ahmed, found himself on the wrong side of the law when he was sentenced to three years in prison for stealing roughly $12 million in cryptocurrency. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York made the announcement recently, stating that Ahmed had hacked into two cryptocurrency exchanges. This article will delve deeper into the events leading up to Ahmed's conviction and sentencing while providing insights into the curious phenomenon of ""white hatting"" in the crypto world.

The Hacking Incidents Unraveled

At the time of his arrest, Shakeeb Ahmed held a position as a senior security engineer for an international technology firm. However, he was neither employed by Amazon nor working during his arrest, contrary to his LinkedIn profile claims. Ahmed targeted two cryptocurrency exchanges – Crema Finance, based on Solana, and Nirvana Finance. He executed these attacks in early and late July 2022, making off with $9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. According to the press release, Nirvana Finance lost nearly all its funds due to the breach, ultimately resulting in its closure.

Upon being charged, Ahmed admitted guilt for carrying out both cyberattacks. Although one victim remained undisclosed, reports indicate that Crema Finance suffered a data breach initiated by Ahmed. Following the incident, Ahmed reached out to Crema Finance with a proposal – return the stolen funds minus a $1.5 million ""finder's fee,"" provided they agreed not to involve law enforcement. Unfortunately for Ahmed, Crema rejected the offer, and he was subsequently captured.

White Hatting: Caveat Emptor

Although such arrangements might seem peculiar in traditional cybersecurity circles, they have gained traction in the burgeoning crypto sector. Transactions like Ahmed's proposed deal with Crema Finance are commonly known as ""white hatting."" Despite involving unauthorized access and theft of digital assets without proper consent, white hats maintain that these agreements serve as a necessary evil – a price to pay for conducting business in the rapidly growing yet vulnerable crypto marketplace.

However, legal entities view things differently. As evidenced by Ahmed's sentence, law enforcement does not condone these practices. Instead, officials consider them illegal activities subject to punishment under existing laws governing computer fraud and abuse. Thus, while some members of the crypto community may regard white hatting as a legitimate practice, stakeholders must remain aware of the potential consequences associated with entertaining such transactions.

As part of his sentencing, Ahmed received an additional three years of supervised release along with orders to surrender $12.4 million (including a substantial portion of cryptocurrency) and repay over $5 million in damages to the affected cryptocurrency exchanges. While the crypto landscape continues to evolve, individuals involved in related industries must adhere to ethical guidelines and applicable regulations to ensure compliance and protect themselves against unwarranted risks and liabilities.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fbi-bitcoin-dark-web.jpg?resize=1200,638",2024-04-12 16:39:59,"Meta Description:

For the first time worldwide, scientists have successfully designed and demonstrated a prototype digitally coded dynamic metasurface antenna, or DMA, managed via high-speed field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Unlike conventional antennas restricted to single frequencies and fixed radiation patterns, this novel DMA operates at the 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, specifically allocated for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) applications. Its high-frequency capability positions it as a promising candidate for advanced beamforming metasurface antennas in forthcoming 6G networks.

How Does It Work?

The DMA owes its extraordinary functionality to intricately crafted metamaterials – artificial structures tailored to optimize interactions between electromagnetic waves and matter. These custom-designed, completely adjustable metamaterial components allow precise manipulation of electromagnetic waves using software controls, thus giving rise to an elite category of leaky-wave antennas capable of swift reconfiguration across various frequencies.

Measuring just larger than a standard matchbox, the compact prototype employs rapid interconnections alongside parallel management of individual metamaterial elements through FPGA programming. This ingenious setup enables the DMA to mold communication beams and generate several beams simultaneously, all while dynamically adapting in nanoseconds to maintain consistent network coverage.

Impressive Potential Applications

Beyond revolutionizing wireless communication, this pioneering DMA holds immense potential for diverse sectors. Professor Qammer H. Abbasi, one of the leading authors from the University of Glasgow, stated, ""Our exceptionally designed prototype marks a significant milestone in next-generation adaptive antennas, surpassing existing advancements in reconfigurable programmable antennas... With the potential to extend operations into the terahertz range, this innovation opens doors to numerous groundbreaking applications such as patient monitoring, enhanced integrated sensing and communications devices, holographic imaging, and improved automotive safety measures.""

Collaborating researcher Dr. Masood Ur Rehman added, ""6G possesses the capacity to bring about transformative changes throughout society. Our intelligent and highly adaptive antenna design represents one of the foundational technologies for the upcoming generation of mmWave reconfigurable antennas. As we look ahead, the programmable beam control offered by the DMA will facilitate finely grained mmWave holographic imaging along with next-generation near-field communication, beam focusing, and wireless power transfer.""
