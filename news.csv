The price of zero-day exploits has surged, reaching up to $7M for iOS and $5M for Android, as tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft fortify their products. With hacking devices becoming increasingly difficult, the zero-day market faces growing complexity, driving costs higher.","Title: The Soaring Price of Zero-Day Exploits: A Hacker's Challenge

In the world of cybersecurity, the worth of zero-day exploits has skyrocketed, reaching multi-million-dollar figures. These coveted digital weapons, unknown vulnerabilities in popular software and hardware, are now being sold for anywhere between $5 to $7 million for iOS zero-days and up to $5 million for Android zero-days. This increase is primarily driven by the growing difficulty in hacking devices and applications from tech giants such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Crowdfense, a startup that buys and sells zero-day exploits, recently published its updated price list. Comparing it to their 2019 list, the highest payouts have more than doubled, from $3 million for Android and iOS zero-days to the current rates. Chrome, Safari, WhatsApp, and iMessage zero-days also saw a significant hike in their value. This surge in prices can be attributed to the relentless efforts of tech companies to improve their security features and make devices harder to penetrate.

Dustin Childs, the head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, explains that it should be increasingly difficult to exploit software and devices every year. Google's Threat Analysis Group also reported that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild in 2023, with spyware vendors accounting for 75% of the zero-days targeting Google products and Android.

The zero-day market is becoming more complicated and time-consuming, driving the overall cost up. According to Paolo Stagno, the director of research at Crowdfense, it is now nearly impossible for a single researcher to find and develop zero-days into full-fledged exploits targeting iPhones or Androids. Instead, it requires a team of several researchers, causing an escalation in prices.

Although Crowdfense offers some of the highest publicly known prices outside of Russia, governments and companies may be paying even more for these valuable exploits. The challenge for hackers lies in staying ahead of the game and finding new ways to breach security, all while the stakes get higher and the odds grow longer.

Introduction

Autism affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, according to the CDC. Early diagnosis is crucial for better developmental outcomes, and EarliTec Diagnostics is leading the charge in revolutionizing the autism diagnosis process. The Atlanta-based startup recently raised $21.5 million in a Series B round to expand its AI-driven system that helps clinicians diagnose children as young as 16 months old. This article will delve into the innovative approach of EarliTec Diagnostics, its impact on the autism diagnosis landscape, and the growing interest in autism-focused healthcare from venture capitalists.

The EarliTec Diagnostics System

EarliTec Diagnostics has developed an FDA-authorized system that uses artificial intelligence to track a child's eye movements during a 12-minute video session. The child watches short videos and social interactions on a screen, and the device analyzes how the child focuses on the content. According to EarliTec, children with autism will not focus on the video in the same way that neurotypical children do.

Traditional autism diagnoses often involve three- to four-hour assessments with potentially long waitlists. EarliTec's system aims to expedite the diagnosis process, allowing clinicians to work with more children and providing parents with quicker results. The system is currently used by eight clinicians across six states, and EarliTec plans to allocate some of its new funding to expand commercialization, research, and age group eligibility.

Growing Interest in Autism-Focused Healthcare

The recent fundraising efforts of EarliTec Diagnostics and other companies in the autism healthcare space have attracted significant venture capital interest. Nexus NeuroTech Ventures, a venture firm focused on brain disorders, and Venture Investors, a Midwestern healthcare-focused venture fund, co-led EarliTec's Series B round.

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity, evolving from a niche product to a mainstream favorite during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become popular choices for enthusiasts who appreciate the variety of layouts and customization options available.

However, as high-end features become more common, the market has become somewhat stagnant, with many keyboards sharing similar characteristics and features. Enter magnetic switches, an exciting innovation that promises to revolutionize the mechanical keyboard scene.

How Do Standard Mechanical Keyboard Switches Work?

A standard mechanical keyboard switch works by physically closing an electrical circuit when you press a key. The two legs on the stem—the part with the keycap attached—push against two metal leaves, which then close the circuit. The shape of the stem and its legs determine whether a switch has a linear, tactile, or clicky feel.

In a linear switch, the stem moves smoothly, while tactile switches feature a slight bump that provides resistance as you press down. The overall design of the stem, spring, and switch housing can significantly impact the feel and sound of a switch, as well as the actuation point—the moment the keypress is registered.

What Makes Magnetic Switches Different?

Magnetic switches, as popularized by Dutch keyboard startup Wooting, rely on magnets and springs instead of a physical electrical circuit. These switches utilize the Hall Effect, a principle discovered in the 1800s, allowing them to sense changes in the magnetic field.

In a magnetic switch, there's a permanent magnet in the stem, and a sensor on the keyboard's PCB detects the switch's position as you press down. This sensor technology enables you to change the actuation point, or how far you need to press down to register a keystroke.

The Advantages of Magnetic Switches

1. Customizable actuation points: With magnetic switches, you can easily adjust the actuation point to suit your specific needs. Gamers, for example, might prefer a lower actuation point for faster response times, while typists might prefer a higher actuation point to reduce unintended keystrokes.
2. Temperature compensation: The sensors in","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4330.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-07 16:30:40," Meta Description:

Welcome to this week’s edition of Mobility Digest, your go-to source for insightful news and analysis on the future of transportation. Let’s dive into the latest developments and trends shaping the industry.

Electric Vehicles: Pricing and Affordability

The first quarter auto sales report revealed that pricing plays a crucial role in the sales of Electric Vehicles (EVs). A recent Edmunds survey highlights the discrepancy between consumer preferences and the current market offerings. According to the survey, 47% of consumers seek EVs priced below $40,000, while 22% aim for EVs priced below $30,000. However, there are currently no new EVs available below $30,000 and only four models below the $40,000 threshold.

This mismatch between consumer expectations and market realities has resulted in inventory clearance sales and price reductions. Automakers like Ford have delayed future EV launches and shifted resources to hybrid vehicles, while Tesla, a prominent player in the EV market, saw its deliveries drop by 20% in Q4 2023.

Tesla’s approach to addressing this issue includes further price reductions and revenue generation through the sales of its Full Self-Driving software, currently available for $12,000 with a free one-month trial for all customers.
