Welcome to Startups Weekly, your weekly roundup of the most exciting and innovative happenings in the world of startups. Sign up now to receive this newsletter straight to your inbox every Friday.

This week, we've seen some exciting developments in the world of startups, including a major acquisition by Microsoft, a controversial departure of a startup founder, and a social media giant getting caught in a data breach scandal.

Stability AI's founder and CEO, Emad Mostaque, announced his departure from the company, which has been facing financial challenges and burn rate concerns. Mostaque has decided to pursue a new venture focused on decentralized AI, leaving the unicorn startup without a permanent CEO. The company is now in the hands of interim co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte.

Microsoft made a bold move this week, acquiring the co-founders and staff of Inflection AI for $650 million. The deal includes $620 million for the use of Inflection's technology and an additional $30 million to ensure the company's founders don't sue for the talent grab. Despite the controversy surrounding the move, Inflection's investors are expected to see a good return on their investment.

In a shocking turn of events, Facebook (now Meta) was caught red-handed snooping on Snapchat's encrypted traffic as part of a covert operation dubbed ""Project Ghostbusters."" The social media giant was seeking to decode user behavior and gain a competitive edge in the market.

Meanwhile, Robinhood unveiled its new Gold Card, which offers a range of features and benefits to its members. For a monthly fee of $5, users can earn 3% to 5% cash back on all purchases, making it an attractive option for those looking to save money on their everyday spending.

One interesting trend this week was the focus on transportation-related startups. The New York Stock Exchange delisted EV startup Fisker, citing its ""abnormally low"" stock prices. The company's shares plummeted over 28% in a single day, and rumors circulated that they had botched a deal with Nissan and were struggling to repay their loans.

Another EV hopeful, Canoo, also found itself in a difficult financial position and turned to the bankrupt Arrival for leftovers in a deal that was more about cobbling together a production line than innovation.

In a separate development, Steve Burns, the founder and CEO of bankrupt EV startup Lordstown Motors, settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over misleading investors about demand for the company's flagship Endurance pickup truck.

Overall, this week was filled with exciting developments in the startup world. As always, stay tuned for next week's edition of Startups Weekly.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080,"""Climate Change Threatens Outdoor Time: MIT Tool Shows Potential Impacts by 2100""","The concept of climate change can be difficult to comprehend, but a new tool developed by researchers at MIT may make it a bit easier to understand. The tool allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked.

The results of this research might be both comforting and alarming, depending on where you live. For example, people in California, France, and Germany might see a little bit more clement weather in the spring and fall, while residents of New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan might lose a week or more of outdoor days.

However, the countries with some of the most vulnerable populations, such as Nigeria and India, could see even more drastic changes. Nigeria's summers could grow even hotter and longer, lopping off nearly two months of outdoor days. India could lose almost two and a half months.

Despite these potential risks, there is hope. If the world fails to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but still manages to by 2070, the situation will improve dramatically. For example, Nigeria and India would only lose one month of outdoor days, and more northerly regions would retain some of their added outdoor days.

This new tool is part of a field of study known as climate scenario analysis, which seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. While this field has been around for a while, advances in computational power have made it more broadly applicable than before.

Several startups are using this predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future. These startups are focused on various markets, including investors, lenders, insurers, agriculture, and outdoor events. Many of these startups have attracted significant funding, with Jupiter Intelligence raising $97 million, Cervest raising $43 million, and One Concern raising $152 million.

As more businesses and consumers become aware of the impact of climate change on their lives, their demand for certainty will create new markets for these startups and their peers. Climate scenario analysis, once a niche limited to academic labs and insurance companies, is poised to enter the mainstream.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"Understand the climate change impact using MIT's outdoor days tool.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-credo-for-the-ai-age-always-be-modernizing/,IT's credo for the AI age: Always be modernizing," ""Modernize IT Infrastructure for AI, Edge Systems & Sustainability""","Looking to modernize your IT infrastructure but struggling with outdated systems? You're not alone. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), edge systems, and sustainability, many existing systems are simply not up to the task. This has led to a renewed push for hybrid or multi-cloud services.

According to a new survey by Nutanix, adoption of hybrid and multicloud clouds is expected to double over the next one to three years. CIOs and IT leaders are quickly moving new platforms and architectures into service to support AI, edge systems, security, and sustainability. Nearly four in ten respondents, 37%, say running AI applications on their current IT infrastructure will be a ""significant"" challenge.

But this is all relative, and the meaning of modernization in the 2024 context is to adopt hybrid cloud strategies to manage and run applications and data while reducing some complexity and costs in the process (fingers crossed). IT modernization is a top priority for many IT executives, and investments in their first-ranked priority for the year, which is AI, are on the rise.

AI is driving this new wave of IT infrastructure modernization, with the goal of achieving greater data mobility across core cloud and edge environments. Nearly all respondents say they plan to upgrade their AI applications or infrastructure, with more than half saying they need to improve the transfer of data between cloud, data center, and edge environments to support their AI initiatives.

Modernization is about collaboration, and it's essential to have the full engagement of the people working on the migration and new solutions. Rocket Software's Puneet Kohli says that modernization is about driving value in a way that positions their business for the long term. He suggests that successful modernization requires a continuous effort that uses the best of what a business has and takes it to the next level.

In addition to AI, edge computing is also taking center stage as a technology investment area in 2024. At least 90% of executives seek to strengthen their edge strategies, and 72% will be pouring more money into related technologies. Infrastructure deployment and management in edge locations is a critical ingredient of any AI/ML strategy.

The challenge to moving to the cloud is that ""lift-and-shift"" approaches can be clunky. More than one third of IT executives, 35%, say workload and application migration is a significant challenge given their current IT infrastructure. There's an increased demand for application containerization, which can serve as workarounds to supporting both legacy and more modern environments. Thus, containerization - the creation of portable self-sufficient applications that can be moved across any platform at any time - continues at full speed. Everyone is doing it - 97% indicate that some portions of their application assets are containerized.

In conclusion, IT modernization is crucial for businesses looking to support AI, edge systems, security, and sustainability. With the adoption of hybrid and multicloud clouds, the challenges of IT infrastructure modernization are on the rise. However, with the right approach, businesses can drive value in a way that positions them for long-term success. By focusing on collaboration, continuous improvement, and the use of the best technology, businesses can modernize their IT infrastructure and stay ahead of the curve.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/4a21d44d2c9a7875f214cd3349a207aaea708e1a/2024/03/29/f6628a42-8a5b-480c-ac6e-5fa4c794911a/hongkong-gettyimages-1159521351.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-29 00:00:00,"Hybrid Cloud Modernization: Upgrade Your IT Infrastructure with Nutanix

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deepmind-safe-ai-based-app.html,"DeepMind develops SAFE, an AI-based app that can fact-check LLMs"," Improve Search Rankings with SAFE, an AI-based App for LLM Fact-Checking. ","The world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, with new advancements being made every day. One of the most exciting areas of AI research is the development of large language models (LLMs) that can generate human-like text. However, these models have one major flaw: they can produce inaccurate results. This is where a new AI-based system called SAFE comes into play.
Developed by a team of researchers at Google's DeepMind, SAFE is designed to check the accuracy of answers provided by LLMs. The system works by breaking down claims or facts in an answer and then using Google Search to find sources for verification. By comparing the two answers, SAFE can determine whether the original LLM's response was correct or not.
To test the system, the researchers used it to verify approximately 16,000 facts contained in answers given by several LLMs. They found that SAFE matched the findings of human (crowdsourced) fact-checkers 72% of the time. When testing disagreements between SAFE and the human checkers, the researchers found SAFE to be the one that was correct 76% of the time.
The team at DeepMind has made the code for SAFE available for use by anyone who chooses to take advantage of its capabilities by posting it on the open-source site GitHub. This means that anyone can use SAFE to fact-check the results of LLMs and ensure that their responses are accurate.
Overall, the development of SAFE is an exciting advancement in the field of AI research. By providing a means of automatically fact-checking the results of LLMs, the system can greatly improve the value of these models and make them more reliable for a wide range of applications.
In conclusion, the SAFE system represents a significant step forward in the development of AI-based fact-checking tools. By providing a means of automatically verifying the accuracy of outcomes generated by LLMs, SAFE can help to make these models more trustworthy and valuable for a wide range of applications.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-openai-unveils-voice-cloning-tool.html,OpenAI unveils voice-cloning tool, Voice Cloning Tool: OpenAI Takes Cautious Approach ,"In today's era of digital communication, the ability to create audio deep fakes is becoming increasingly easier and cheaper. This technology has the potential to be used for malicious purposes, such as spreading disinformation and impersonating individuals, which can have serious consequences. This is why OpenAI, a leading AI research company, has announced that they plan to keep a voice-cloning tool that they have developed tightly controlled until safeguards are in place to prevent audio fakes.

The tool, called Voice Engine, can essentially duplicate someone's speech based on a 15-second audio sample. OpenAI has conducted a small-scale test of the tool and has released the results. However, the company recognizes the risks associated with this technology and is taking a cautious approach to its release. They are engaging with U.S. and international partners from across government, media, entertainment, education, civil society, and beyond to ensure that they are incorporating their feedback as they build.

Disinformation researchers are particularly concerned about the misuse of AI-powered applications in the context of the upcoming election. They fear that the proliferation of voice-cloning tools, which are cheap, easy to use, and hard to trace, could lead to rampant disinformation. To address these concerns, OpenAI has implemented a set of safety measures, including requiring explicit and informed consent of any person whose voice is duplicated using the tool. It must also be made clear to audiences when voices they are hearing are AI-generated.

The incident involving the robocall impersonating Joe Biden's voice, which was created by an operative for a Democratic presidential rival, highlights the potential for misuse of this technology. Experts are concerned that the deluge of AI-powered deepfake disinformation in the 2024 White House race, as well as in other key elections around the globe this year, could have serious consequences.

In conclusion, OpenAI's voice-cloning tool has the potential to be a powerful tool for good, but it also poses significant risks. The company is taking a cautious and informed approach to its release and has implemented safety measures to prevent its misuse. It is important that we remain vigilant and take steps to prevent the spread of disinformation and protect the integrity of our democratic processes.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/openai-says-ways-to-ve.jpg,2024-03-30 06:23:09,"Title: AI-Powered Voice Cloning: What You Need to Know

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/tiktok-ban-implication-amazon/,TikTok ban could harm Amazon sellers looking for alternatives,Title: TikTok Ban Threatens Amazon Sellers' Alternative Marketplaces,"TikTok Ban Could Harm Amazon Sellers Looking for Alternatives

In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could force ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban in U.S. app stores. While the focus of the bill has been on data security and speech rights, the interplay of tech giants and geopolitics is also squeezing smaller merchants who are looking for new channels to expand their customer bases.

Over the past few months, merchants, many from China, have flocked to TikTok to sell their products to U.S. buyers through the TikTok Shop platform. According to Jungle Scout, an Amazon data intelligence provider, 20% of Amazon sellers, brands, and businesses have plans to expand to TikTok Shop this year. Before the political backlash took off, ByteDance reportedly projected that it could grow its U.S. e-commerce business tenfold to $17.5 billion this year.

While TikTok Shop has not provided any updated numbers on the number of merchants currently on the platform, it has been growing in popularity among merchants looking for alternatives to Amazon. Its rise is part of a bigger shift we have seen around alternative marketplaces, such as Temu, which is commanding more attention from shoppers, Chinese e-commerce exporters, and merchants.

TikTok has been trying to boost its e-commerce business since its U.S. launch in September 2023. Unlike Temu, known for its seas of cheap, white-labeled products from Chinese factories sold directly to U.S. consumers, TikTok's strategy has been to onboard and highlight more branded goods, making it a more direct competitor to Amazon.

TikTok has also been looking to attract sellers with more traditional subsidies. For example, to encourage merchants to sell goods at a steep discount during the recent Black Friday sales period, TikTok doled out subsidies to those merchants to mark down their prices by as much as 50%.

Merchants have been interested in selling on the app simply because TikTok's short video platform generates massive engagement. According to a survey from Tabcut, a Chinese firm that tracks TikTok Shop performance, nearly 70% of sellers reported an","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=1200,669",2024-03-30 17:00:02,"Optimized Meta Description: ""With TikTok's potential ban in U.S. app stores, Amazon sellers look for alternatives to expand their customer base.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-optimization-based-method-autonomous.html,An optimization-based method to enhance autonomous parking,"""Optimization-Based Autonomous Parking Enhancer: OCEAN""","

Autonomous vehicles have long been the dream of the automotive industry and robotics research community. However, the reliable deployment of these vehicles has been challenging, with only limited testing in specific settings. Recently, researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai developed OCEAN, an optimization-based trajectory planner that significantly enhances the ability of cars to safely reach a parking spot without colliding with objects on the way.

The OCEAN planner addresses the two primary limitations of previous approaches to autonomous parking: the inability to accurately predict collisions and poor performance in real-time tests. The planner builds on the previously introduced Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA) approach, improving its ability to avoid collisions, robustness, and speed in real-time.

The researchers tested their planner on hundreds of simulated scenarios and conducted real-world experiments in public parking areas. The results showed that OCEAN outperformed a variety of methods for autonomous parking applications, indicating that it has better system performance and makes it possible to deploy large-scale parking planners on low computing power platforms that require real-time performance.

The OCEAN planner could be further improved and tested in additional real-world trials, and it could be deployed by automotive companies to contribute to the introduction of automated vehicle parking technologies. The possibility of autonomous parking is a promising development that could revolutionize the way we park and move around our cities.

In conclusion, the development of OCEAN, an optimization-based trajectory planner for autonomous parking, represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous driving. The planner addresses the primary limitations of previous approaches and has shown promising results in real-world testing. With further improvements and testing, OCEAN could pave the way for the widespread deployment of autonomous parking technologies, improving the efficiency and safety of parking in our cities.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/x-confirms-plans-for-nsfw-communities/,X confirms plans for NSFW Communities, Twitter Confirms NSFW Communities ,"Twitter, formerly known as X, has recently made updates to its Communities feature, which allows users to create smaller groups with their own feeds outside of the main timeline. One of the most significant updates is the addition of an ""Adult Content"" label that Community admins can use to avoid having their content automatically filtered. This change confirms earlier tests of NSFW communities on the platform and suggests that Twitter is now more directly embracing the adult content that has always been present on the platform.

NSFW (not safe for work) content plays a major role on Twitter, which has been a primary advertising venue for sex workers as well as home to a large amount of adult content-focused bots and spam. According to internal documents obtained by Reuters in 2022, roughly 13% of all Twitter posts included NSFW content. What's more, the documents indicated that adult content was one of the fastest-growing genres on the platform, even as news and sports were declining.

Recent reports have detailed the rise of spam bots on the service, which promoted NSFW content with links in their profiles and regularly replied to posts with explicit messages. Now, Community admins can use the ""Adult Content"" label to explicitly designate their communities as such and keep their content from being filtered automatically.

The changes were posted on Twitter by an engineer and reshared by CEO Linda Yaccarino and owner Elon Musk. They come as Twitter continues to promote its Communities product as a key part of its growth plans. If successful, Communities could potentially serve as a competitor to larger forum sites like Reddit and host training data for Musk's xAI-run chatbot Grok, which has exclusive access to Twitter content.

In addition to the ""Adult Content"" label, Twitter is also introducing a Ban button alongside Keep and Hide buttons on the Reported posts page, along with more detailed messages explaining why users are not eligible to join a given Community. The company is also introducing tools to sort posts by Trending, Most recent, and Most liked, as well as a Media tab for Communities on Android. Other updates include support for spam filter levels set by admins, simplified reporting and moderation pages, and audio Spaces in Communities.

The Future of Data Transparency in the AI World: The Importance of Verifiable Computing

As AI technology continues to advance, one of the biggest challenges facing the industry is data transparency and verifiability. With the increasing number of data manipulations, it has become essential to ensure that data and brands are trustworthy. This is where Space and Time, a web3 startup, comes in.

According to Scott Dykstra, CTO and co-founder of Space and Time, there is a need for more data transparency and verification in the AI world. He believes that this is especially important in light of recent events, such as the FTX collapse, where an organization with brand trust was found to be manipulating its internal records.

Dykstra sees this as a problem that extends beyond FTX and into other industries, where there is an incentive for financial institutions to manipulate their records. However, he believes that ZK proofs, a cryptographic solution that allows for the verification of data without revealing the origin data itself, can help address this issue.

Space and Time aims to be the verifiable computing layer for web3 by indexing data both off-chain and on-chain. The startup has already indexed data from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, Sui, Avalanche, Sei, and Aptos, and is adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

Dykstra's biggest concern is that AI data is not really verifiable. He believes that there needs to be a decentralized, globally available database that can be created through blockchains. This would ensure that everyone can access the data and operate it in a way that's readily available and uncensorable.

In a hypothetical scenario, Dykstra envisions a database of a journal that is owned by the community and operated by the community rather than being controlled by OpenAI. This would ensure that the data is transparent, verifiable, and accessible to everyone.

In conclusion, the future of data transparency in the AI world is crucial. With the increasing number of data manipulations and the need for trustworthy data, Space and Time's verifiable computing layer and ZK proofs can help address this issue. By creating a decentralized, globally available database that can be created through blockchains, we can ensure that data is transparent, verifiable, and accessible to everyone.

Stripe recently released its annual letter, highlighting several fast-growing areas within the company. One of these areas is the “Revenue and Finance Automation” (RFA) unit, which helps businesses manage billing, tax, and revenue recognition. Stripe’s RFA unit is expected to reach a $500 million annual run rate this year, the company announced.

To support the growth of its RFA unit, Stripe has made an acqui-hire of a four-person team from Supaglue, a startup that raised a $6.8 million seed round in November 2021. Supaglue is an open-source developer platform for user-facing integrations, and its team will help accelerate Stripe’s work on real-time analytics and reporting across its platform and third-party apps for the RFA suite.

Supaglue was founded by George Xing and Thomas Chen, who previously worked on the data teams at Lyft and Uber. They realized that managing data and business metrics across teams was inconsistent and fragmented, which could lead to bad decisions and even worse business outcomes. Supaglue’s product helps companies import and centralize customer data from third-party data sources like Salesforce or other customer relationship management systems into their own applications.

The acqui-hire of Supaglue was a result of mutual work acquaintances introducing the team to Stripe. Xing and Chen describe meeting Stripe as “pretty serendipitous.” After folks in their extended network made the introduction, and because Supaglue was also doing a fair amount of integration work, the two companies began having conversations, and when Stripe offered to buy them, they accepted.

Supaglue is just one of several things going on at Stripe this year. The company has also announced an employee stock sale deal and partnerships with companies like authentication startup Clerk and a fun one with electric boat startup Navier. Considering the growth Stripe alluded to in its annual letter, Supaglue will likely quickly find fast friends within Stripe’s ecosystem.

In recent news, the use of Microsoft's Copilot on government-issued devices has been officially prohibited by the US Congress. According to Axios, the memo from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor stated that the AI chatbot poses a risk to leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services, which led to its ban. While employees can continue using Copilot on their personal devices, it will be blocked on all Windows devices owned by the Congress.

This decision comes a year after the Congress set strict limits on the use of ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by OpenAI's large language models. While staffers were allowed to use the paid version of ChatGPT for research and evaluation, the free version was banned on House computers. In response to this, Microsoft announced a roadmap of tools and services designed for government use, including an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant. These tools and services will feature higher levels of security that make them more suitable for handling sensitive data.

The White House also recently revealed rules federal agencies must follow when it comes to generative AI, which ensure that any tool they use does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans. With these developments, it is clear that the government is taking data security seriously and is taking steps to protect sensitive information.
