This revised SEO title effectively communicates the main point of the article within the character limit. It includes essential keywords (e.g., ""X,"" ""blue checkmarks,"" ""hide,"" ""Premium users"") without unnecessary words, making it suitable for both readers and search engines.","Title: Say Goodbye to Hiding Blue Checkmarks on X: A Twist in the Evolving Saga

Elon Musk's social networking platform, formerly known as Twitter, has announced that it will remove the option for paid users to hide their blue checkmarks. Previously introduced as a feature for X Premium subscribers, hiding the checkmarks allowed users to keep their payments private while enjoying additional perks such as editing capabilities, extended post lengths, and enhanced direct messaging options. However, times are changing once again for X's blue checkmarks.

Originally, blue checkmarks served as a prestigious badge awarded by Twitter to notable profiles, distinguishing them from potential impersonations. But following Elon's takeover, the checks transformed into a pay-to-play feature, diminishing their value as indicators of influence or authenticity. Despite this shift, X Premium continued to offer unique advantages, prompting users to embrace the previously coveted blue tick – albeit quietly.

However, the upcoming removal of the ""hide checkmark"" functionality might leave some users feeling exposed, particularly those who preferred keeping their X subscriptions discreet. As reactions pour in, one user lamented, ""I liked being a X Premium subscriber, but I didn't like the dumb checkmark. Come on @elonmusk, let me hide that I'm paying for your dumb website."" With the loss of this customization feature, individuals may feel pressured to reveal their financial commitment to X, potentially influencing their decision to maintain or cancel their subscriptions.

Meanwhile, X faces ongoing challenges related to trust and safety, including impersonation, misinformation, and online abuse. By turning the blue checkmark into a revenue generator, Elon weakened its role in addressing these critical concerns. Moreover, recent changes have further muddled the meaning behind blue checkmarks on the platform. After initially restricting checkmarks to paying customers, X later expanded eligibility to prominent figures with sizable followings, irrespective of whether they were X Premium members.

Additionally, the company recently bestowed blue checkmarks upon influential users boasting over 2,500 ""verified"" followers. Offering X Premium subscriptions to these users and X Premium+ subscriptions to those surpassing 5,000 ""verified"" followers, X appears to have adopted a multi-level marketing approach. Consequently, deciphering the significance of blue checkmarks has become increasingly challenging due to ambiguous criteria and insufficient labeling.

In summary, X's forthcoming elimination of the ""hide checkmark"" feature marks another turn in the evolving story surrounding blue checkmarks. While this modification impacts privacy preferences for current X Premium users, broader questions about credibility and transparency remain unanswered. Trust and safety continue to plague the platform, leaving users uncertain about the future implications of blue checkmarks adorning their favorite handles. Only time will tell if X can restore faith in its ever-changing authentication system or if alternative solutions emerge to address the growing demand for reliable identity verification across digital landscapes.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-blue-gold.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-12 04:25:40,"""Discover how X's removal of 'hide checkmark' impacts blue checkmarks.

A cybersecurity engineer, Shakeeb Ahmed, made headlines when he was sentenced to three years in prison for stealing nearly $12 million in cryptocurrency. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the sentence following Ahmed's conviction of hacking into two cryptocurrency exchanges. Let's delve deeper into the story and explore the implications of such actions in the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies.

The Crime Unfolded

Ahmed, a once respected cybersecurity professional, exploited his skills to gain unauthorized access to two cryptocurrency exchanges. He managed to steal around $12 million in crypto assets, attracting the attention of law enforcement agencies. As details emerged, it became apparent that Ahmed had attempted to negotiate a deal with one of his victims, Crema Finance, demanding a ""unofficial finder's fee"" of $1.5 million and immunity from prosecution in exchange for returning the stolen funds. However, Crema rejected the offer, leading to Ahmed's eventual capture.

White Hatting or Black Hat Hacking?

Although negotiations like these have been somewhat commonplace in the crypto sphere, they remain highly controversial and raise questions about ethical boundaries. While some argue that paying off hackers might prevent further damage, others insist that caving into ransom demands only encourages similar criminal behavior. Moreover, Ahmed's actions clearly cross the line between white hat (ethical) and black hat (malicious) hacking practices. It serves as a reminder that compromising security protocols and stealing assets cannot be justified under any circumstances, regardless of potential financial gains.

Consequences of Crossing the Line

Ahmed's sentence – consisting of three years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a requirement to forfeit $12.4 million along with restitution payments to the affected exchanges totaling over $5 million – demonstrates the severe consequences of his actions. This outcome highlights the importance of adhering to legal and moral guidelines in cyberspace and emphasizes the zero-tolerance policy towards digital asset theft.

Lessons Learned

This incident offers valuable insights for both individuals and organizations involved in cryptocurrencies:

1. Strengthen Security Measures: Implement robust security measures and regularly update them to protect digital assets from various types of threats.
2. Adhere to Ethical Standards: Refrain from participating in illicit activities, including making backroom deals with criminals, no matter how enticing they may seem.
3. Collaboration Between Industries: Encourage cooperation among different sectors, particularly between cybersecurity professionals and cryptocurrency platforms, to develop effective strategies against cybercrime.
4. Report Suspicious Activities: Promptly report suspicious activities to local and federal law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators face justice for their crimes.

Moving Forward

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-vision-tool-crisis-zones-accurately.html,New computer vision tool can count damaged buildings in crisis zones and accurately estimate bird flock sizes, ,"Title: A Revolutionary AI Framework for Counting and Estimation: Damaged Buildings and Bird Flocks

In 2018, the world witnessed the devastating Palu tsunami in Indonesia. To assess the damage, researchers analyzed 113 high-resolution satellite images, counting and categorizing building damage using before-and-after-disaster satellite images. This laborious process involved counting individual buildings and assessing their damage levels across various sub-regions. This data was instrumental in estimating the extent of damage caused by the disaster.

Now, a team of computer scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has developed an AI framework, DISCount, capable of both quickly detecting damaged buildings in crisis zones and accurately estimating bird flock sizes. This groundbreaking framework combines the power of artificial intelligence and human analysis to provide rapid, reliable estimates for various applications.

The researchers' work has been acknowledged by the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence with an award for the best paper on AI for social impact. The team, comprised of Subhransu Maji, Gustavo Pérez, and Dan Sheldon, initially focused on two separate projects:

1. Developing a computer vision tool to accurately count buildings damaged during natural disasters or conflicts for the Red Cross
2. Assisting ornithologists at Colorado State University and the University of Oklahoma in obtaining accurate bird flock estimates using weather radar data

The researchers aimed to create automated tools that non-AI experts could use while maintaining a high degree of reliability. However, they encountered obstacles using standard computer vision models, which lacked sufficient accuracy. The team sought a new approach to counting problems by integrating human and artificial intelligence.

DISCount is a framework that works with existing AI computer vision models, enabling humans to analyze smaller, critical datasets determined by the AI. In the case of building damage assessment, the AI could select images from a few critical days, allowing human researchers to hand-count damaged buildings and extrapolate the data across the entire region. The framework also estimates the accuracy of human-derived estimates, providing researchers with valuable information for informed decision-making.

The potential applications for DISCount are vast, from disaster response to wildlife population monitoring. This revolutionary approach to counting and estimation offers a faster, more comprehensive, and reliable solution than human or artificial intelligence methods used in isolation.

Introduction:
In recent times, cybersecurity has become a significant concern for organizations worldwide, especially those involved in policymaking. One such entity, The Heritage Foundation, fell victim to a cyberattack earlier this week, marking another security breach since 2015. This article delves deeper into understanding the situation, potential implications, and past incidents concerning this prominent conservative think tank.

Body:
On Friday, The Heritage Foundation admitted experiencing a cyberattack, promptly shutting down its network to contain the damage. While investigations continue, the extent of the intrusion remains unknown, including whether any sensitive data was compromised during the event (Politico, n.d.). Although no definitive proof exists, sources suggest that nation-state hackers might be responsible for this attack—a common occurrence given think tanks' links to governmental affairs and often high-level personnel.

Established in 1973, The Heritage Foundation holds considerable sway over conservative policies and enjoys strong connections to key players in the US political landscape. As a result, they frequently face targeting attempts by foreign actors seeking valuable insider intelligence and strategic advantage. Unfortunately, this latest intrusion isn't unprecedented; back in 2015, hackers successfully pilfered internal communications and private details related to the think tank's supporters following another successful cyberassault (Finkle & Funk, 2015).

Cybersecurity challenges aren't unique to The Heritage Foundation alone. Other prominent American think tanks have faced similar threats in recent years due to their influence on shaping public opinion and impacting decision-making processes. With numerous experts and former U.S. administration officials among their ranks, these institutions represent attractive targets for adversaries looking to gain an edge in geopolitical conflicts.

Rewind to 2014, when Russian hackers targeted multiple American research centers – including The Brookings Institution – stealing vast amounts of confidential correspondence and intellectual property (Katz, 2018). Such attacks highlight the vulnerabilities inherent in our interconnected world and underscore the importance of vigilance against increasingly sophisticated digital adversaries.

Introduction

In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve and transform various industries, recent developments involving tech giant Microsoft and AI research laboratory OpenAI have raised questions about the role of AI in national defense. Documents obtained by The Intercept revealed that Microsoft presented its adaptation of OpenAI's image generator, called DALL-E, to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in October 2023. This article delves into the implications of this disclosure while also exploring the complexities surrounding AI ethics and policy enforcement.

Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Partnership

At the heart of this issue is the collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI through their joint product, Azure OpenAI (AOAI). Combining Microsoft's robust cloud computing capabilities with OpenAI's powerful generative AI technologies, AOAI offers numerous possibilities for machine learning (ML) applications. During a Department of Defense training seminar focused on AI literacy, Microsoft showcased potential uses for AOAI, including content analysis, virtual assistance, and even creating images for battle management system training.

Policy Changes and Public Confusion

Initially, OpenAI's policies discouraged using its models for military development. However, in early 2023, references to ""military"" and ""warfare"" mysteriously disappeared from OpenAI's guidelines. Now, the company merely bans activities that may cause physical harm or damage to individuals or property. When questioned about these changes, OpenAI explained that they aimed to accommodate certain military use cases compatible with their mission, focusing primarily on defensive measures and cybersecurity. Nevertheless, the possibility of weapons development, injuries, and property destruction cannot be entirely ruled out when discussing battlefield management system training.

Microsoft's Response and Clarification

Following the controversy, Microsoft acknowledged that its presentation did not represent actual implementations but rather served as illustrative examples for potential AOAI use cases. Liz Bourgeois, an OpenAI spokesperson, further emphasized the importance of adherence to company policies, stating, ""We have no evidence that OpenAI models have been used in this capacity... OpenAI has no partnerships with defense agencies to make use of our API or ChatGPT for such purposes."" Despite this clarification, concerns linger regarding the application of AI technologies in military contexts and the responsibility of corporations working alongside government entities.

Balancing Ethics and Collaboration

As demonstrated by Microsoft's partnership with the U.S. Army, integrating advanced technologies like AOAI into military operations comes with significant ethical considerations. While there may be valid reasons for employing AI in defensive capacities or enhancing cybersecurity efforts, striking a balance between innovation and responsible deployment remains paramount. Establishing transparent communication channels and ensuring strict adherence to corporate policies become essential components in managing expectations and mitigating risks associated with potentially controversial collaborations.

Conclusion

The intersection of AI advancements and military applications presents both opportunities and challenges for all parties involved.
