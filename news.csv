https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/net-neutrality-wont-survive-a-trump-presidency/,Net neutrality won't survive a Trump presidency, Trump vs. Net Neutrality: A Second Term Threat? ,"The Future of Net Neutrality: A Tale of Two Presidencies

The battle for net neutrality, a concept that has been weaving in and out of the shadows of federal protection for years, now stands at the precipice of either becoming enshrined in law or vanishing into oblivion. The outcome hinges heavily on the results of the impending election in November. In this blog post, we will delve into the two possible futures for net neutrality, the best-case scenario under a Biden administration, and the potential demise under a second Trump presidency.

Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all online traffic equally, without any preferential deals, prioritization, throttling, or blocking (yes, even the cat videos). This principle, while largely technical in nature, has become a partisan lightning rod in recent years.

Under a Biden Presidency: A fragile victory

If the Democrats secure both the presidency and control of Congress, net neutrality is likely to see new life. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has expressed its intention to reestablish net neutrality rules, similar to those from 2015 but updated to overcome previous legal obstacles. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is set to be voted on later this month, with its passage being all but assured due to the current FCC makeup.

Once implemented, these rules would prevent ISPs from tampering with online traffic. A legislative effort may then follow, modifying the Communications Act that grants the FCC its power, potentially incorporating some aspects of the net neutrality rule. This could be accomplished alongside reforming Section 230 or other political bargaining chips.

But this victory is fragile and could easily be undone by a second Trump presidency or the Supreme Court's potential ruling on the Relentless case, which could significantly diminish the power of independent agencies like the FCC.

The Dark Ages: Net neutrality under a second Trump presidency

If Trump were to win reelection, net neutrality would face several threats. One of the most immediate dangers would be the appointment of a new FCC Chair, who would likely seek to repeal the net neutrality rules once again. This is precisely what former Chairman Ajit Pai did after Trump's inauguration in 2","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3-fcc-seal-repaired.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-04 18:20:05,"Meta Description:

Apple's latest venture: Developing personal robots

For years, Apple has been working on a new product that could change the market. The latest report suggests that the company is developing personal robots to help people at home.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on a robot that could follow people around and be helpful. The project is in its early stages, and it's unclear whether it will lead to a product that Apple sells to consumers.

Apple has been looking for ways to diversify its revenue streams beyond iPhones and the digital content and services it sells to users. The company recently abandoned its plans to develop an electric car, which was a struggling project for over a decade.

The robot project is being overseen by Apple's hardware engineering division and its AI and machine learning group. It's still in the early stages of development, but it's clear that Apple is taking steps to stay ahead of the competition in the technology industry.

As analysts eagerly await Apple's annual WWDC developers gathering, they are also interested in hearing about the company's progress with artificial intelligence. Major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon are also rapidly pursuing the development and deployment of AI products.

However, Apple has always been tight-lipped about its AI plans, despite a steady stream of media leaks over the years. The company has never publicly disclosed its electric vehicle plans, and it's unclear whether the robot project will lead to a product that Apple sells to consumers.

One thing is certain, however: Apple is always looking for new and innovative ways to stay ahead of the competition and capture the imagination of its customers. Whether it's developing personal robots or exploring new frontiers in AI, Apple is sure to keep us all on our toes.

Introduction

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Nagoya University in Japan have successfully developed a framework for evolving diverse personality traits in dialogue AI using a large-scale language model (LLM). This research brings us closer to creating AI agents that can interact with humans in a more engaging, personable, and life-like manner.

The Power of Large-Scale Language Models

Large-scale language models, such as those used in popular AI applications like ChatGPT, enable computers to communicate with people in a way that resembles human conversation. The research team, led by Professor Takaya Arita and Associate Professor Reiji Suzuki, aimed to explore how LLMs could be harnessed to evolve prompts that encourage a wider range of personality traits during social interactions.

The Prisoner's Dilemma and AI Personality Traits

To examine the development of AI personalities, the researchers employed the prisoner's dilemma from game theory. In this game, each AI player chooses between cooperating with or defecting from their partner. The outcome of the game determines the AI's virtual earnings. By utilizing the prisoner's dilemma, the team was able to evolve AI agents with diverse personalities based on natural language descriptions of personality traits encoded in their genes.

Through the course of the study, the researchers observed various types of personality traits, with the evolution of AIs capable of switching between selfish and cooperative behaviors, mirroring human behavior. This ability to adapt strategies through evolutionary processes resulted in AI agents that could effectively balance self-interest and cooperation, echoing human societal dynamics.

In the ever-evolving world of data storage, research groups from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University have made a significant breakthrough. They have demonstrated the feasibility of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium, paving the way for increased storage capacity and cost-effective solutions in hard disk drives (HDDs).

At present, data centers store vast amounts of data on HDDs equipped with perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR). With areal densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/in2, PMR technology has been the go-to method for data storage. However, to transition to higher areal densities, a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium with FePt grains combined with heat-assisted laser writing is required. This method, known as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), can sustain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/in2.

In a recent study published in Acta Materialia, the team successfully arranged FePt recording layers three-dimensionally. By fabricating lattice-matched, FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer films, with Ru as a spacer layer, they achieved a significant milestone. Measurements of the magnetization reveal that the two FePt layers have different Curie temperatures, which makes three-dimensional recording possible by adjusting the laser power when writing.

The researchers also demonstrated the principle of 3D recording through recording simulations. By using a media model that mirrors the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media, they showed that multi-level recording is, indeed, achievable in a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium.

The three-dimensional magnetic recording method has the potential to revolutionize the data storage landscape. By stacking recording layers in three dimensions, more digital information can be stored with fewer HDDs. This leads to energy savings for data centers, as well as a more efficient and cost-effective approach to data storage.

In the future, the research team aims to develop processes that reduce the size of FePt grains, improve orientation and magnetic anisotropy, and stack more FePt layers. This will help realize a media structure suitable for practical use in high-density HDDs, further pushing the",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/proof-of-principle-dem.jpg,2024-04-04 11:00:33,"Discover the future of data storage with 3D magnetic recording!

In the vast expanse of natural ecosystems, a fascinating phenomenon known as the herd mentality reigns supreme â€“ from schools of fish to beehives and ant colonies. This collective behavior empowers the whole to surpass the sum of its parts, enabling better responses to threats and challenges. Recently, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin have taken inspiration from this natural marvel to create ""smart swarms"" of microscopic robots.

The concept of microscopic robots â€“ or microrobots â€“ acting in unison as a coordinated group, performing tasks more efficiently than they would if moving independently or at random, is not new. However, the researchers have taken this idea a step further by endowing these swarms with an innovative trait called adaptive time delay.

Associate Professor Yuebing Zheng and his team first unveiled their novel optical feedback system in a 2023 paper, which facilitated the development of adaptive time delay for microrobots. This strategy offers potential for scalability and integration into larger machinery, enhancing the operational efficiency of autonomous drone fleets and enabling convoys of trucks and cars to navigate highways in unison with improved responsiveness and increased robustness.

Adaptive time delay allows each microrobot within the swarm to adapt its motion in response to changes in local surroundings. In a new paper published in Science Advances, Zheng and his team demonstrated that this increased responsivity did not compromise the swarm'

s robustness â€“ its ability to maintain integrity in the face of environmental changes.

Imagine nanorobots autonomously navigating complex environments, such as bloodstreams or polluted waters, collectively overcoming obstacles and threats. This swarm mentality could lead to advanced drug delivery forces capable of eluding the human body's defenses to deliver medicine to its target or iRobot-like robotic vacuums for contaminated water, cleaning every bit of an area together.

While the research has proven this swarm mentality in a lab setting, the next step involves introducing more obstacles and replicating the behavior in flowing liquids and inside organisms.

On Thursday, Reuters reported that Alphabet, Google's parent company, is contemplating the acquisition of Boston-based HubSpot, a customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing automation powerhouse, currently valued at over $33 billion. This article will delve into the implications of this potential deal, its likelihood, and the benefits for both parties.

The reported acquisition cost would undoubtedly be substantial, with a significant premium over the current market value. Google would need to incentivize HubSpot to sell, as merging with the search giant would be a considerable shift. The two companies already have a partnership, using Google ads to fuel HubSpot sales, which can sometimes pave the way for acquisition discussions.

Google has been consistently active in making acquisitions, with its most significant deal being the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility in 2011, later sold to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. A more recent large acquisition was spending $5.4 billion for Mandiant in 2022. However, Google typically prefers deals under $3 billion, making this potential acquisition unusual for the company.

In addition, the tech industry has seen recent austerity programs and job cuts. Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of upcoming job cuts in January, making such a significant acquisition seem unlikely in the current climate. Nonetheless, with a cash reserve of $110 billion as of the end of last year, Google has the financial means to proceed with the acquisition.

Another challenge facing Google in acquiring HubSpot is the hostile regulatory environment for large deals. Regulators in the U.S., U.K., and E.U. have been closely monitoring significant deals, with some, like Adobe's attempt to buy Figma for $20 billion, falling through due to competitive concerns. Although HubSpot faces stiff competition from Adobe and Salesforce, adding it to Google's portfolio would not provide a monopoly in the CRM market, it might still face regulatory hurdles and associated termination fees.

The primary question is the likelihood of the deal and what benefits it would offer both companies beyond their existing partnership. According to one analyst, the deal doesn't seem probable, but one can never be certain.

In a move to ensure the security and authenticity of its platform, X has announced a significant crackdown on spam accounts. The company is embarking on a proactive initiative to eliminate accounts that violate its rules against manipulation and spam. This decision comes shortly after the appointment of two new leaders to its safety team.

Kylie McRoberts, an existing X employee, has taken on the role of Head of Safety, while Yale Cohen, previously of Publicis Media, has joined as the Head of Brand Safety and Advertiser Solutions. This move underscores X's commitment to tackling the long-standing issue of spam, a priority that Elon Musk had outlined as early as November 2022.

However, the fight against spam has proven to be a challenging task. Extensive job cuts have left Twitter's Trust & Safety team understaffed, and the role of Head of Safety remained vacant for 10 months after the departures of Ella Irwin and Yoel Roth under Musk's tenure. Moreover, advancements in AI have made it even more difficult to control the influx of spam.

Despite Musk's initial concerns about the prevalence of bots on the platform, which was one of the sticking points when he tried to back out of the $44 billion Twitter deal, he now boasts about X seeing record traffic. However, it's unclear whether his numbers include bots and spam.

The X Safety team's announcement clarifies that the company will cast a wide net in its attempt to remove spam and bots. This proactive measure may result in a reduction in follower counts for some users, a common occurrence during bot sweeps on the platform. Users who believe they have been affected unfairly can appeal via a provided form.

The rise of spam promoting adult content is another concern. Some bots have been found posting explicit replies with links in their bios, exploiting the platform for inappropriate purposes. X's crackdown aims to address this issue and maintain a safe and spam-free environment for its users.

In conclusion, X's latest initiative to eliminate spam and bot accounts is a positive step towards ensuring a more secure and authentic platform","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bots-glitch-x-twitter.jpeg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-04 18:52:46,"""X tackles spam & bots: Secure platform initiative.

A recent study has uncovered an intriguing aspect in computer chip design that could potentially revolutionize the electronics industry. This discovery suggests that materials typically disregarded in chip design, known as substrates, actively participate in information processing, paving the way for faster and more efficient electronics.

An international team of researchers, led by Penn State, utilized advanced imaging techniques to examine the interaction between semiconductor materials and substrates. The focus of their study was the semiconductor material vanadium dioxide (VO2) and its interaction with the substrate material titanium dioxide (TiO2). The researchers were in for a surprise when they discovered that there seems to be an active layer in the substrate that mirrors the behavior of the semiconductor material on top of it when the semiconductor switches between an insulator and a metal state.

This revelation opens up new possibilities for designing future materials and devices. According to study lead Venkatraman Gopalan, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State, ""New ideas are needed for smaller and faster electronics in order to keep up with Moore's law. One idea being pursued is materials, such as vanadium dioxide, that can switch between metal and insulator states in a trillionth of a second.""

Vanadium dioxide has been a material of interest due to its potential as a metal-to-insulator transistor, thanks to its low energy consumption. However, its properties are not yet fully understood, and it has typically been observed in isolation rather than in a real device. This new study, however, investigates vanadium dioxide in a device, applying a voltage to make it switch from an insulating to a conducting state.

The team used the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory, which utilizes powerful X-ray beams to study the behavior and structure of materials at the atomic level. The APS X-ray penetrated through the VO2 film and into the TiO2 substrate, revealing unexpected changes to the structure of the material and substrate.

In an effort to address the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the global workforce, some of the world's leading tech companies have formed the AI-Enabled Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Workforce Consortium. The consortium, comprised of Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, SAP, and six advisers, aims to help those who have lost or will lose their jobs to AI by providing access to training programs and connecting them with businesses seeking their skillsets.

The AI-Enabled Workforce Consortium's mission is to equip workers with relevant skills and knowledge about the impact of AI on the workforce. This initiative is crucial in today's rapidly changing job market, where AI adoption is leading to job displacement in various industries. Companies like UPS and IBM have already begun laying off employees or freezing hiring as they seek AI-ready talent or replace positions with AI.

According to a study from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, US companies have cut over 4,600 jobs in 2023 due to AI adoption. However, the consortium members acknowledge that lost jobs are an inevitable part of AI innovation. They hope that upskilling and reskilling support will help workers transition into new careers in other roles.

The consortium has set an ambitious goal of positively impacting over 95 million individuals worldwide in the next 10 years. Although this target is somewhat vague, the member companies have provided specifics on how they plan to achieve this:

 Cisco aims to train 25 million people in cybersecurity and digital skills by 2032.
 IBM plans to skill 30 million individuals in digital skills, including 2 million in AI, by 2030.
 Intel aims to train more than 30 million people with AI skills for current and future jobs by 2030.
 Microsoft will train and certify 10 million people from underserved communities with in-demand digital skills by 2025.

Introduction

The Apple Watch is a remarkable device that offers a myriad of features, enabling us to stay connected, track our fitness goals, and manage our daily tasks with ease. However, one common complaint among Apple Watch users is its battery life. This article will explore five effective strategies to enhance your Apple Watch's battery life, even during watchOS 10.

1. Disable the Always-On Display

One of the most impactful ways to conserve battery life on your Apple Watch is by disabling the always-on display. Although this feature can be convenient, it significantly drains the battery. To turn off the always-on display, navigate to Settings > Display & Brightness > Always On and toggle the feature off. While it may be less convenient, your Apple Watch's battery life will be extended.

2. Utilize Low Power Mode

Low Power Mode can be a lifesaver when your Apple Watch's battery is running low. Although it limits certain features, it can extend the battery life significantly. To enable Low Power Mode, lift your Apple Watch and press the side button to bring up the quick settings menu. Tap your battery percentage and hit the ""Low Power Mode"" button. Scroll through the list of disabled features and tap the ""Turn On"" button.

3. Disable Cellular Connectivity

If your Apple Watch has cellular connectivity, turning it off when not in use can help conserve battery life. Your watch may constantly search for an LTE signal, draining the battery in the process. To disable cellular connectivity, open Settings > Cellular on your watch and toggle off ""Cellular."" Alternatively, you can use Airplane Mode to achieve the same result, but be aware that it also disables Wi-Fi.

4. Turn Off Background App Refresh

Background App Refresh allows apps to fetch data continuously, ensuring they remain up-to-date. However, this feature consumes battery life. To disable Background App Refresh, navigate to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle the feature off. Although this change may slightly affect functionality, it can improve endurance.

5. Disable Irregular Heart Rate Notifications

Some newer Apple Watch models can alert users to irregular heart rate intervals and potential atrial fibrillation. However",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/2f2bf25712b951e4d4049e46f723941335e9ea86/2024/04/04/332c6112-19b0-4aeb-8df9-8381278e0b08/apple-watch-series-8-zdnet.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-04 00:00:00,"Meta Description: Optimize your Apple Watch's battery life with these 5 effective tips!

Google, the search engine titan, has long held the dominant position in the market. However, with the emergence of new generative AI models threatening to disrupt its stronghold, Google is contemplating a seismic shift in its business model.

A recent report by the Financial Times, citing insider sources, revealed that Google is considering introducing a paywall for premium generative AI features in its search engine. This move would see these advanced AI-powered search features being added to Google's premium subscription service, Google One, which was introduced in February.

Engineers are currently working on the technology to implement the model, but Google executives have yet to make a final decision on when, or indeed if, the paywall will be introduced. The Google One plan, priced at $20 per month, offers users access to Gemini for Workspace (previously known as Duet AI), which integrates Google's AI assistance throughout its productivity apps, such as Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Meet.

In addition to the AI features, the Google One plan includes other perks like 2TB of storage, Google Photos editing features, 10% back in Google Store rewards, Google Meet premium video calling features, and Google Calendar enhanced appointment scheduling. Google's traditional search engine would continue to remain free and ad-supported.

However, the introduction of a paid search tier represents a significant departure from Google's long-standing business model, which has kept its search engine free since its inception over two decades ago. The question remains: why start charging for search now? The cost of deploying and maintaining generative AI features on its search engine is undoubtedly high. But, whether users would be willing to pay for such an AI-assisted search service, especially when there are numerous free alternatives available, remains to be seen.

Moreover, competitors like ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot pose a formidable challenge. Just this week, ChatGPT simplified user access to its free chatbot by removing the need for logins, making it as simple as visiting the site and typing into the chatbot. Microsoft's Copilot, on the other hand, offers an even stronger alternative to Google, with its conversational responses, access to up-",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9ec88adb2d66a4ebb9a9c5e4a5948364fb2dfcd8/2024/04/04/eb95027f-78bc-45bf-b71d-20cdf86065ba/cointelescope-gettyimages-1361877833.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-04 00:00:00,"Meta Description:
