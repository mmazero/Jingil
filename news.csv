In the face of climate change and the need for cleaner energy sources, nuclear power has been touted as a viable carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. However, the recent cancellation of a next-generation nuclear plant in the United States has raised questions about the viability of small modular reactors (SMRs). This article will delve into the current state of SMRs, their potential benefits, and the challenges they face in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.

[The Current State of SMRs]

Despite the collapse of NuScale's project in Idaho, which faced escalating costs from $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion, proponents of nuclear power remain optimistic about the future of SMRs. Mason Lester, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, pointed to several positive developments in the US nuclear sector. One such example is the BWRX-300, a new SMR design by GE Hitachi, which is expected to begin producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, by 2029. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned US power company, has also invested in the BWRX-300.

[Challenges and Opportunities]

The main challenge facing SMRs is managing costs and risk allocation. Marcia Burkey, chief financial officer at TerraPower, noted that rising commodity prices, including steel and uranium, have contributed to higher costs. However, she emphasized that innovation could help address these issues. TerraPower, which is backed by Bill Gates, is focusing on a novel liquid sodium-cooled fast reactor technology that requires less labor and fewer costly materials.

Another project in development is by Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, which has selected Gadsden, Alabama for its Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) assembly plant, slated to go online in 2027. Despite progress in the US, Europe appears to be lagging behind, with no advanced SMR designs as advanced as those in the United States.

Biped climbing robots, or robots that can navigate and move on two legs in vertical environments, hold immense potential for a variety of real-world applications. These include maintenance tasks on tall structures, delivery of packages in hard-to-reach locations, and even search and rescue missions. To make the most of these potential applications, however, these robots must be able to accurately sense and map their surroundings while predicting their location within mapped environments.

Researchers at Guangdong University of Technology have recently proposed a new method to improve the ability of biped climbing robots to estimate their state and map their surroundings while navigating truss structures, which are triangular systems consisting of interconnected elements. This method, introduced in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems, uses a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm designed specifically for a biped climbing robot (BiCR) developed at their lab, the Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab.

""BiCR is an electromechanical system that moves via grippers at both ends and rotates with multiple joints, allowing it to be used for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and high-risk environments, such as construction site scaffolding and power towers,"" Weinan Chen, co-author of the paper, told Tech Xplore.

The primary objective of the study was to enable a bipedal climbing robot to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while climbing truss structures. The proposed SLAM-based approach, called BiCR-SLAM, uses information about the BiCR robot's configuration, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras to localize the robot and map the truss it is climbing.

The framework consists of four components: an encoder dead reckoning, a LiDAR odometry estimation tool, a pole landmark mapping model, and a global optimization technique. The encoder dead reckoning uses data from joint encoders to estimate the robot's motion, while the LiDAR odometry estimation tool uses point clouds from LiDAR to estimate the robot's motion and create a map of its surroundings.

Paddy Cosgrave, co-founder of the Web Summit tech conference, is resuming his position as CEO after stepping down last year due to controversial statements about the Israel-Gaza war. After rumors circulated over the weekend, Cosgrave confirmed his return via a post on X. Notably, his announcement does not address the inflammatory remarks that led to his departure. Instead, Cosgrave focuses on shifting the conference's approach to become more ""intimate, convivial, and community-focused.""

This pivot towards smaller, targeted groups echoes Mark Zuckerberg's emphasis on ""community"" at Facebook following its post-2016 election scandal. By catering to different agendas and opinions, large entities like Web Summit can create a more inclusive environment while pursuing their primary goal of scaling their events and attracting a wider audience.

In a blog post, Web Summit outlined its new focus on targeting smaller communities, aiming to provide more value to individual attendees and attract lucrative sponsorships. As the CEO of a company that runs several large global tech conferences, including the flagship event in Lisbon, Cosgrave's return may help the organization regain stability and strengthen relationships with sponsors and attendees.

Last year, Web Summit faced criticism from large tech sponsors who pulled out of the Lisbon event due to Cosgrave's controversial statements. The controversy began when Cosgrave posted data on X about the Israel-Palestine conflict without mentioning recent events, which led to an outcry from the tech community, particularly Israel-based VCs and founders. Cosgrave initially doubled down on his stance before eventually apologizing and resigning as CEO.

Web Summit appointed Catherine Maher, former CEO of Wikimedia, as a temporary replacement. However, she left the company a few months later, leaving Cosgrave to return as CEO. This move allows him to rebuild Web Summit's reputation and refocus on its core mission of connecting and supporting the global tech community.

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous, spanning various fields from robotics to economics. However, their inherent complexity makes mathematical modeling and control challenging. To address this issue, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system has emerged as a powerful tool, simplifying the control of nonlinear systems by approximating them as multiple linear systems. This article explores the development of novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model (FDS) and their real-life applications.

The T–S fuzzy system utilizes fuzzy logic to map input and output values, making it easier to model nonlinear systems. By combining the T–S fuzzy system with the space–state representation, the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS) has been developed. Despite extensive research, optimal control strategies in the context of T–S FDSs are still largely unexplored, with robust control methods introducing additional complexity and optimization challenges.

To tackle these limitations, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from the Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan developed new optimal and robust-optimal controllers. The team transformed the stability conditions of the FDS model into Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) to establish the stability conditions for the mathematical model, forming the basis for three controllers: stability, optimal, and robust-optimal.

The stability controller, utilizing Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC) to manage deviations, effectively stabilized the system. The optimal controller minimized a cost function for optimal control, reducing settling time from 13 to 2 seconds, a six-fold reduction. The robust-optimal controller combined the benefits of both, outperforming the optimal controller in scenarios with white noise introduced into the control input, demonstrating lower error values.

These findings highlight the adaptability and potential of these controllers in real-life applications, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial robots, where stable control in dynamic and uncertain environments is paramount.

Drones have become an indispensable tool for various applications, from aerial photography to infrastructure inspection. However, their limited battery life has always posed a significant challenge. Researchers from the University of Southern Denmark have been working diligently to tackle this issue, and their latest breakthrough involves drones that can recharge directly from power lines. This innovative concept could revolutionize the way drones are used, particularly for tasks that require extended airtime.

The researchers equipped a Tarot 650 Sport drone with a customized electric quadcopter propulsion system, an autopilot module, and other essential components. The drone's intelligent systems are designed to detect low battery levels and initiate the charging process. It employs a camera and millimeter-wave radar system to locate the nearest power line, which is then approached from below. The drone uses a pair of inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into a gripper, where an inductive charger draws current from the power line. Once the battery is fully charged, the gripper releases the cable, and the drone resumes its mission.

Initially, the researchers envisioned this technology being used for drones that inspect power lines. The team first unveiled a self-charging drone that topped up its battery from power lines in 2022. In their latest demonstration, they enhanced the gripper system and showcased a practical application for this groundbreaking technology.

In a paper to be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the researchers describe their project as ""a first-in-the-world system with the ability to sustain operation throughout many inspection/charging cycles powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment."" The drone successfully completed over two hours of flight time through five cycles of power line inspection and charging, marking a significant milestone in drone technology.

Imagine a world where drones can continuously inspect vast power line networks, monitor wildlife in remote regions, or provide real-time information during natural disasters, all without the need to land and recharge.
