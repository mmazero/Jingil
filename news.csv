In the realm of mobile innovation, a new player has emerged, promising to revolutionize the way we interact with artificial intelligence (AI) and safeguard our privacy. Jolla, a Finnish mobile phone startup, is making a comeback with a groundbreaking device that aims to provide users with a secure and private AI experience.

Jolla's latest creation, the JollaMind², is a compact black box that serves as a personal cloud and AI router. It's designed to keep your data private and accessible for running AI queries, acting as a personal server and AI hub.

The JollaMind² offers a solution by providing users with a secure and private hub for all their AI processing needs.

The JollaMind² is designed to seamlessly integrate with mainstream mobile platforms, adding a layer of security and privacy to existing apps and services. Jolla envisions the device evolving into a platform of its own, attracting developers to build apps that operate within its protective wrapper of privacy and security.

Jolla's mission is to democratize AI innovation, preventing a repeat of the past mobile cycle, where Big Tech companies dominated the market. They believe that generative AI has the potential to be a game-changer, but only if it's developed with a focus on privacy and security.

The JollaMind² is currently in the prototype stage, and a sneak peek at its capabilities reveals a promising glimpse into the future of AI-powered assistance. The device can handle natural language queries, contextually relevant responses, and even email triage, all while keeping the user's data secure.

Jolla plans to officially announce its first AI product on May 20, 2023, marking a decade since the company's initial announcement of its Sailfish mobile phone. Pre-ordering is expected to begin at that time, with the JollaMind² hitting the market in Q4 of 2023.

Jolla's return to the mobile scene with a focus on AI innovation is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of technology. The JollaMind² promises to usher in a new era of AI-powered assistance, prioritizing privacy and security without compromising on functionality. As the device takes shape and enters the market, it will be exciting to see how it transforms the way we interact with AI and safeguard our digital lives.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/initia-raises-7-5m-seed-money-to-ease-blockchain-development/,Initia raises $7.5M seed round to simplify blockchain development,"

In the ever-evolving realm of cryptocurrencies, Initia, a brainchild of young developers, is making waves by addressing a persistent challenge: the complexity of building blockchain applications.

Initia's mission is to enhance interoperability among multichain networks and simplify the creation of app-specific blockchains, known as app chains. While popular blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin dominate the scene, app chains offer developers greater freedom to customize economic and governance structures.

However, this fragmentation of the blockchain landscape creates friction for users, who must navigate diverse gas fees, wallets, and explorers. Initia's co-founder, Ezaan Mangalji, emphasizes the magnitude of this challenge, especially when transferring assets between blockchains.

Initia's solution lies in providing a Layer 1 blockchain network specifically designed to facilitate a system of L2 rollups. These rollups offer scalability and sovereignty, while leveraging the Cosmos SDK for flexibility. In essence, Initia aims to abstract away the technical complexities of app chains, making them more accessible to users and developers alike.

Stan Liu, Initia's other co-founder, envisions a future where thousands of applications are built on crypto without users even realizing it's a crypto project. The goal is to create an ""Apple App Store"" for crypto applications, ensuring easy access for users.

Initia's recent $7.5 million seed funding, led by Delphi Ventures and HackVC, is a testament to its potential. The startup plans to utilize this investment to expand its ecosystem, enhance its chain and platform, and support Layer 2 applications.

Initia's journey began with a different focus: decentralized finance (DeFi). However, the FTX implosion prompted a pivot towards blockchain infrastructure, recognizing the need to address the fragmentation and complexity issues plaguing current blockchains.

With a team of 20 people spread across the globe, Initia is poised to revolutionize the way blockchain applications are built and used. Its focus on interoperability, simplicity, and scalability has the potential to unlock a new era of innovation in the crypto space.

Embat, a Spanish fintech startup, is tackling these challenges head-on with its innovative real-time treasury management solution.

Embat's Journey: From Inception to Success

Embat was founded in 2021 by a trio of finance experts: Antonio Berga, Carlos Serrano, and Tomás Gil. Their mission was clear: to digitize and automate financial processes, empowering finance teams to work smarter and faster.

The startup's efforts have not gone unnoticed. Embat recently secured $16 million in Series AS funding, led by Creandum, with participation from Samaipata, 4Founders, Venture Friends, and several notable angel investors. This funding will fuel Embat's growth and expansion plans.

Embat's focus on AI, global connectivity, and automated cash accounting sets it apart from the competition.

In the realm of generative AI, Writer, a San Francisco-based startup, stands out with its focus on creating practical business solutions. Their latest innovation, Palmyra-Vision, is a text-generating model that draws inspiration from images, including charts and graphs.

May Habib, Writer's co-founder and CEO, explains their strategic decision to prioritize multimodal content, emphasizing text output as their core offering. This approach has led them to analyze images rather than produce them, at least for now. Their current focus is on generating text from existing visual data.

Palmyra-Vision employs a multi-model approach, where each model plays a specific role in interpreting the image and generating text with remarkable accuracy. This opens up a world of use cases, such as automating text generation for e-commerce websites, where product descriptions can be effortlessly updated based on changing images. It can also interpret charts and graphs, extracting key insights and takeaways.

Compliance checking is another area where Palmyra-Vision shines. For instance, pharmaceutical companies can leverage the model to ensure that ad copy complies with FDA regulations by comparing it against associated documents.

While Palmyra-Vision can interpret handwritten notes, Habib stresses the importance of training the model for specific use cases, such as medical or insurance, to achieve optimal accuracy.

Habib emphasizes the crucial role of human review in the workflow, as AI models can sometimes hallucinate or make errors. She envisions a more automated workflow in the future, but for now, human oversight remains essential.

Writer has secured $126 million in funding to date and is exploring partnerships with major cloud infrastructure platforms to scale its operations. The latest iteration of Palmyra, featuring image-to-text capabilities, is now available.

In a world saturated with digital photography, a refreshing throwback to the analog era is gaining traction. Lapse, a smartphone app, offers a unique experience that harkens back to the days of film cameras and disposable snapshots.

With Lapse, you can capture moments without the instant gratification of seeing them immediately. Instead, you must wait for your photos to ""develop,"" just like in the old days. This adds an element of anticipation and excitement to the process, encouraging users to be more mindful and intentional about their shots.

The app's popularity is evident in its millions of users, 100 million photos captured monthly, and consistent top-10 ranking in the U.S. app store for photographic apps. This success has attracted a new round of funding, totaling $30 million, led by Greylock and DST Global Partners, with participation from previous backers.

Lapse plans to use this funding to enhance the photo experience, explore video capabilities, and potentially introduce monetization strategies that avoid the traditional advertising route.

Behind the scenes, Lapse employs a series of processing steps to optimize the photos, using computer vision and proprietary technology. However, the app has faced criticism for its initial use of growth-hacking tactics, such as forced invites, to expand its user base.

Despite this, Lapse claims to have moved away from these practices and now relies on organic growth and word-of-mouth. However, some users still find the app's interface challenging to navigate, especially when it comes to sharing photos with specific groups of friends.

In the current landscape of consumer apps, Lapse presents an alternative to the dominant social media platforms that have shifted away from sharing with close friends and toward news, entertainment, and influencer content.

Investors see potential in Lapse's focus on simplicity and authenticity, believing it can fill the void left by the evolution of other platforms. The app's unique approach to photo-sharing may resonate with users seeking a more genuine and personal way to connect with their friends.

However, it has evolved into a platform that analyzes a company's internal data to provide relevant answers to employee inquiries. This includes information from support tickets, chat messages, and customer relationship management platforms.

While connecting proprietary data to a GenAI platform raises concerns about privacy and data security, Glean assures users of its secure and private nature. It respects the permissions set in a company's data sources, ensuring that employees only receive answers based on the data they're authorized to access. Additionally, Glean employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground its responses in external sources of knowledge, making every answer fully referenceable.

Despite competition from tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI, Glean has experienced remarkable growth, with its annual recurring revenue quadrupling in the past year. This success is attributed to its strong customer base, which includes Duolingo, Grammarly, and Sony.

This innovative TV created a buzz, and now, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, founder and CEO Balaji Krishna has revealed plans for new models and features.

Expanding the Displace Lineup: Introducing the 'Display Mini'

The Displace family is growing with the introduction of the 'Display Mini', a compact 27-inch TV designed for smaller spaces like kitchens and bathrooms. This TV offers the same wireless convenience and sleek design as the larger model, making it an ideal choice for those seeking a more compact TV experience.

AI-Powered Shopping and Contactless Payment: The Future of TV

Displace is not just about providing a wireless TV; it also aims to revolutionize the way we interact with our screens. The upcoming models will feature an ""AI-powered shopping engine"" that allows viewers to purchase products directly from advertisements. This seamless shopping experience eliminates the need to switch between devices or search for products online, making it a convenient and immersive way to shop.

Availability and Future Plans

Displace is currently fulfilling pre-orders for the 'Display Flex' and plans to start shipping mid-year. The company is also aiming to secure a $5 million Series A funding round to support its growth and development.

While most consumers are accustomed to traditional TV setups, Displace has garnered significant interest from art studios, museums, and even embassies. These organizations appreciate the unique mounting capabilities of the Displace TV, which allow for flexible placement on walls or even windows.

How Does the Displace TV Work?

The Displace TV uses a vacuum suction system to attach to various surfaces, including dry walls. It features swappable batteries that power the screen, eliminating the need for unsightly cables. The TV streams content from a base station, similar to LG's OLED M.

The 'Display Flex' can stay on the wall for up to 10 months using its vacuum system. In case of a power outage or system failure, the screen gradually lowers itself using a zipline-like mechanism, ensuring a safe and controlled descent.

Unveiling the Enigma: Probing the Limits of AI Classification

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), we often encounter questions that challenge our understanding of these technologies. One such question, posed by MIT CSAIL Assistant Professor Dylan Hadfield-Menell, delves into the complexities of measuring AI's capabilities, particularly in the context of computer vision and classification.

Hadfield-Menell begins by asserting that data is a subjective property of the world, emphasizing the need for critical thinking when evaluating AI systems. He presents a thought-provoking example: a picture of a cat. Is it truly an image of a cat, or is it merely a collection of pixels that have been manipulated? This question becomes even more intricate when we introduce synthetic data, which raises the issue of adversarial examples.

Adversarial examples are slight, often imperceptible changes made to an image that can cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. Hadfield-Menell poses a intriguing question: if a classifier misclassifies a modified image of a cat, is it wrong? Or is it simply responding to the altered data?

The key takeaway here is that the data used to program AI systems is more akin to a computer program than a reflection of the real world. We instruct AI systems on what to do by providing examples of good and bad outputs. However, this approach has limitations.

Data selection, Hadfield-Menell argues, is a form of programming. When we choose data to train AI systems, we are essentially specifying a subjective idea of what we want the system to do. This subjectivity can lead to confusion and misinterpretations, as we saw with the recent ChatGPT ""hullabaloo.""

The challenge lies in effectively communicating the goal of the subjective choices made by AI designers. This ability to explain the targeting and nature of AI model work is crucial for realizing the full benefits of AI.

Hadfield-Menell's insights provide valuable fodder for thought, especially for students who are shaping the future of AI. As they craft elevator pitches, develop models, and attempt to define AI, they must grapple with these fundamental questions.

Stay tuned for more insights from our esteemed guests as we continue to explore the fascinating world of AI!
