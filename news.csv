Truecaller Unveils Call Recording and Transcription Feature in India

Truecaller, the renowned caller identity service, has launched a new feature that allows users to record and transcribe phone calls in India, its largest market. This feature is exclusively available to premium subscribers on both Android and iOS platforms, with support for English and Hindi transcriptions.

Key Highlights:

- Call Recording: Premium users can now record incoming and outgoing calls, providing a convenient way to capture important conversations or take notes during phone calls.

- Transcription: The recorded calls are automatically transcribed, generating text versions of the conversations. This feature is particularly useful for creating summaries or sharing call details with others.

- Privacy Considerations: Unlike in the U.S., where a beep sound alerts the other party when a call is being recorded, India's regulations do not require such a notification.

- Easy Access: On Android, a dedicated recording button is integrated into the Truecaller dialer. For other dialers, a floating recording button appears during calls.

- iOS Integration: Due to Apple's restrictions, iOS users must initiate the recording manually by opening the Truecaller app, selecting the ""Record a call"" option, and merging the calls.

- Storage and Accessibility: Recordings are stored locally on iOS devices, with the option to save them on iCloud. Once the transcription is complete, users receive a notification.

Truecaller's Financial Performance:

Despite recent challenges, Truecaller's user base continues to grow. In Q4 2023, monthly active users increased by 11% to 374 million, and daily active users grew by 12% to 305 million. However, the company's revenue experienced a decline, with a 4% year-on-year decrease in Q4 and a 2% drop in yearly revenue for 2023.

Truecaller's Focus on Premium Services:

To counter the decline in ad revenues, Truecaller is focusing on growing its subscriber revenue. The company is hopeful that the introduction of features like call recording, priced at ₹79 per month or ₹529 per year, will encourage users to upgrade to premium plans.

Regulatory Developments in India:

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recently proposed a caller ID service called calling name presentation (CNAP) on top of cell networks. However, Truecaller does not view this service as a direct competitor.

Truecaller's Future Prospects:

Analysts believe that Truecaller may face challenges in improving its ad revenue in the Indian market. The company is expected to continue investing in subscriber growth, particularly in the U.S. market, where higher price points and a greater willingness to pay for services exist.

In the realm of smartphones, the back panel often remains an untapped canvas of potential. While the front screen captures all the attention, the rear side of our devices remains largely neglected. It's time we demand more from this vast expanse, transforming it from a blank slate into a dynamic and functional element.

The idea of a secondary screen on the back of a phone isn't entirely new. Yota Phone attempted this concept a few years ago, but unfortunately, the venture didn't gain traction and the company faced bankruptcy. Foldable devices emerged as a more captivating innovation, overshadowing the potential of a dual-screen design.

Enter Infinix with its E-Color Shift technology, an intriguing take on the secondary screen concept. It introduces a splash of color to the mix, allowing users to customize the back panel with various hues and patterns. However, it falls short of being a fully functional, low-power display like Yota's device promised. Instead, it serves as a playful aesthetic enhancement, adding a touch of personality to the often-hidden rear surface.

The E-Color Shift technology employs a unique approach to color manipulation. By applying different voltages, the electric field within the microstructure changes, causing specific color particles to move and display the desired shades. This innovative mechanism enables the phone's shell to effortlessly change ""skins"" without consuming power, maintaining the display without draining the battery.

While the technology made its debut at CES last month, my first-hand experience with it came at MWC in Barcelona. It's important to note that this was a prototype in its early stages, far from a polished consumer product. The setup required the dummy unit to be connected to an external battery pack, highlighting the developmental nature of the technology.

Despite its limitations, the E-Color Shift panel shares a key advantage with e-ink displays: the ability to hold a static image even when the battery is not actively powering it. This feature opens up possibilities for persistent notifications, status updates, or simply displaying a personal message or artwork.

Whether this technology will be licensed to other manufacturers or remain exclusive to Infinix devices remains to be seen. It's hard to imagine a mass market appeal based solely on this feature, considering its limited functionality and the fact that it's likely to be covered up by a case or simply face down on a surface most of the time.

Nevertheless, the E-Color Shift technology represents an interesting exploration in the realm of smartphone design. It challenges the conventional notion of a static, unchanging back panel and opens up possibilities for more dynamic and personalized interactions with our devices. While it may not be a game-changer in its current form, it sparks curiosity and invites further innovation in this often-overlooked aspect of smartphone design.

North American VCs Face Challenges in the European Startup Market

A few years ago, North American venture capital firms (VCs) flocked to Europe, enticed by the region's potential for outsized exits. However, the European startup market has proven to be a challenging landscape for North American investors.

The European startup market has grown rapidly in recent years, with deal volume more than doubling in the past decade. However, the market is also highly fragmented, with each country having its own language, currency, and regulatory environment. This makes it difficult for North American VCs to navigate the market and identify promising investment opportunities.

Another challenge for North American VCs is the increasing competition from European VCs. Over the past decade, the European VC market has matured significantly, and there is now much more competition for the best deals, especially at the early stages. This has made it more difficult for North American VCs to secure attractive investments.

Despite these challenges, some North American VCs are still trying to plant roots in the European market. One reason for this is that Europe has a number of advantages over the United States, including a more favorable regulatory environment for certain industries, such as AI and crypto. Additionally, U.S.-based limited partners (LPs) have been showing increasing interest in Europe, as they seek to diversify their portfolios.

If North American VCs want to succeed in the European market, they need to develop a strategy that takes into account the unique challenges and opportunities of the region. They need to be prepared to invest in local talent and build relationships with local investors and entrepreneurs. They also need to be patient, as it may take time to build a successful portfolio in Europe.

Conclusion

The European startup market is a complex and challenging landscape for North American VCs. However, there are a number of reasons why North American VCs should still consider investing in Europe. With careful planning and execution, North American VCs can overcome the challenges and reap the rewards of investing in one of the world's most dynamic startup ecosystems.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/02/26/apology-for-uk-lgbtq-doctors-stripped-of-their-right-to-practice/,Apology For U.K. LGBTQ Doctors Stripped Of Their Right To Practice,"

A Long-Overdue Apology: Medical Regulator Acknowledges Past Injustice Against LGBTQ+ Doctors

In a profound act of acknowledgment and contrition, England's medical regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC), has extended a formal apology to dozens of doctors who faced investigations or lost their right to practice due to their sexual orientation during a time when homosexuality was illegal in the country.

The apology stems from a thorough investigation conducted by the GMC, which revealed that at least 40 doctors underwent fitness-to-practice inquiries between the 1890s and the mid-1960s solely based on their sexual orientation. Shockingly, eight of these individuals were permanently erased from the medical register, effectively ending their careers.

GMC Chair Professor Dame Carrie MacEwen expressed deep remorse for the harm inflicted upon these doctors, acknowledging that homophobic laws and attitudes prevalent until the 1980s caused immense personal and professional suffering. She recognized that the regulator's actions compounded this harm by taking punitive measures against those convicted under anti-gay laws.

While most of the affected individuals have passed away, the GMC encourages anyone who believes they or someone they know was unfairly investigated to come forward for a personal apology. The organization acknowledges that the true number of doctors subjected to unjust actions may never be known, but the impact on their lives and those close to them was undoubtedly significant.

This apology marks a crucial step in addressing past injustices and acknowledging the ongoing challenges faced by LGBTQ+ doctors. Campaigners have welcomed the move but emphasize that LGBTQ+ doctors still encounter stigma and discrimination in their workplaces.

Dr. Duncan McGregor, from the Association of LGBTQ+ Doctors and Dentists (GLADD), expressed hope that the apology would bring solace to the affected doctors and their loved ones. He stressed the importance of righting past wrongs and acknowledging historical injustices, even if the damage caused cannot be undone.

Despite the repeal of anti-gay laws, stigma surrounding sexual orientation persists in the medical field. A 2022 study by GLADD and the British Medical Association revealed that less than half of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer medics feel comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation at work. Alarmingly, over 43% of LGBQ medics reported experiencing homophobia or biphobia in the past two years.

Emma Runswick, Deputy Chair of the British Medical Society, hailed the apology as a vital recognition of the injustice and harm done to doctors whose careers were destroyed. She expressed hope that it would bring some peace and vindication to those affected. However, she also emphasized the need to combat current and historic prejudice, acknowledging that discrimination still persists despite progress made.

This apology serves as a reminder of the long-lasting consequences of discrimination and the importance of creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all healthcare professionals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
