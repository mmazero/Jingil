In a world where everyone has a story to tell, Inkitt, an innovative startup, is harnessing the power of AI to transform compelling narratives into blockbusters. With the vision of becoming the ""Disney of the 21st century,"" Inkitt is revolutionizing the entertainment landscape.

Through its eponymous app, Inkitt empowers aspiring writers to self-publish their stories. Leveraging AI and data science, the platform identifies the most captivating tales, refines them, and distributes them on its second app, Galatea, where readers can indulge in these literary gems.

With over 33 million users and numerous bestsellers under its belt, Inkitt is expanding its horizons. The company's latest funding of $37 million will fuel the creation of AI-generated stories based on original ideas, personalized fiction tailored to individual readers, and ventures into games, audiobooks, and video content.

CEO and founder Ali Albazaz envisions Inkitt as a multimedia empire, a hub for captivating content that transcends traditional publishing boundaries. This vision has attracted investors, including Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, who believes in the potential of hyper-personalized entertainment.

Inkitt's success stems from its innovative approach to storytelling. It embraces the digital age, crafting shorter chapters optimized for mobile devices and incorporating dynamic effects to enhance the reading experience. Additionally, A/B testing allows Inkitt to gather valuable data, optimizing each story's elements to maximize engagement.

Despite the decline in reading time, Inkitt is thriving. Its post-pandemic growth trajectory reflects the public's desire for escapism and immersive experiences. Albazaz claims Inkitt ranks among the top 11 best-selling publishers globally, outperforming traditional giants like Penguin Random House.

Inkitt's focus on undiscovered talent sets it apart. Rather than courting established authors with big egos, the platform nurtures emerging writers, providing them with a platform to showcase their creativity. Albazaz emphasizes the role of AI in crafting compelling narratives, while acknowledging the need for human intervention to ensure quality and originality.

Inkitt's commitment to innovation extends to its use of cutting-edge technology. It collaborates with various LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI, to generate captivating stories. Additionally, DeepL powers automatic translation into 10 languages, ElevenLabs provides text-to-speech narration for audiobooks, and Leonardo generates cover art.

Inkitt's cautious approach to IP protection is evident in its diverse selection of LLM providers. The company aims to avoid over-reliance on any single platform, minimizing the risk of proprietary data usage. It also employs strategic prompting techniques to prevent LLMs from learning too much about its best-performing works.

Inkitt's mission aligns perfectly with Vinod Khosla's vision of a hyper-personalized entertainment future. Khosla believes that Inkitt's ability to create meaningful and personalized content positions it as a frontrunner in the evolving entertainment landscape.

In the realm of storytelling, a startup called Inkitt is embarking on an ambitious mission to revolutionize the entertainment industry. Founded on the belief that every individual harbors a captivating story, Inkitt aims to transform these narratives into blockbusters, akin to a modern-day Disney. With a recently secured $37 million in funding, the company is poised to expand its content horizons and establish a multimedia empire.

Inkitt's journey began with its eponymous app, enabling aspiring writers to self-publish their stories. Employing AI and data science, the platform identifies the most compelling tales, refines them, and distributes them through a second app, Galatea. This approach has already attracted an impressive 33 million users and produced numerous bestsellers.

The fresh influx of capital will fuel Inkitt's expansion into diverse content domains. AI-generated stories based on original ideas, personalized fiction tailored to individual readers, forays into games and audiobooks, and video adaptations of its platform's literary works are all part of the grand vision. Initially produced with human involvement, these videos will eventually be generated solely by AI.

CEO and founder Ali Albazaz envisions Inkitt as a multimedia powerhouse akin to Disney, surpassing competitors like Wattpad. The Series C funding, led by Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, brings Inkitt's total funding to $117 million. Despite a challenging funding climate, investors are eager to participate in Inkitt's future rounds.

Inkitt's aspirations stand in stark contrast to the declining trend of reading in the digital age. With the rise of mobile devices and apps, leisure time devoted to reading has dwindled. Inkitt, however, believes it can reverse this trend by delivering books in innovative ways. Shorter chapters, optimized for mobile reading, and dynamic text effects aim to enhance the reading experience.

Furthermore, Inkitt's data-driven approach allows it to tailor books to readers' preferences. Extensive A/B testing optimizes every aspect of a work, from titles and storylines to cliffhangers. This data-rich environment provides invaluable insights into fiction's performance, guiding subsequent publications.

Inkitt's strategy has proven successful, with engagement time soaring across its platforms, including Galatea and Galatea TV. Albazaz attributes this growth to the post-pandemic desire for escapism. He claims that Inkitt ranks among the top 11 best-selling publishers globally, surpassing established names like Penguin Random House.

Inkitt's revenue has doubled in the past year, and newer ventures like Galatea TV are generating substantial returns. The TV series ""Beautiful Mistake,"" adapted from a Galatea book, has already raked in $500,000. The company is nearing profitability, and royalties for writers are reportedly higher than traditional publishing standards.

While Inkitt primarily focuses on fiction, it steers clear of literary giants. Albazaz prefers to nurture undiscovered talent, avoiding the complexities of working with established authors and their egos. The company's future plans include AI-generated stories and personalized narratives tailored to individual readers.

To realize this vision, Inkitt collaborates with various AI language models (LLMs), including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI. These LLMs assist in narrative construction, complemented by Inkitt's proprietary customizations. Additionally, Inkitt automatically translates books into 10 languages using DeepL AI and employs ElevenLabs for audiobook narration.

Despite the potential of LLMs, Albazaz emphasizes that they alone cannot create best-selling content. Inkitt's accumulated data plays a crucial role in refining AI-generated stories. This approach also mitigates intellectual property concerns, as Inkitt avoids relying heavily on any single LLM.

Inkitt's unique approach has resonated with investors, particularly Vinod Khosla, who believes in the future of hyper-personalized entertainment. Khosla sees Inkitt's mission as a perfect fit, creating content that resonates deeply with individuals.

As Inkitt navigates the ever-changing landscape of AI and storytelling, it remains committed to its goal of building a multimedia empire. With a talented team and a clear vision, the company is poised to transform the entertainment industry, offering personalized and captivating stories that capture the imagination of audiences worldwide.

In the realm of business, recurring revenue is the ultimate goal. Companies like Apple have shifted their focus to services, recognizing the stability and growth potential of subscription-based models. However, acquiring and retaining subscribers is a double-edged sword.

Enter Subsets, a Danish startup aiming to bridge the retention gap in the subscription industry. Their AI-powered platform leverages ""explainable AI"" to identify subscribers at risk of churning and suggests personalized strategies to keep them engaged.

Subsets' AI is designed to be transparent, providing clear explanations for its recommendations. This aligns with the growing societal demand for trustworthy AI, especially in industries like media, where customer loyalty is paramount.

With early customers like the New York Times-owned Athletic and Danish newspaper Børsen, Subsets has gained traction and recently secured $1.65 million in pre-seed funding. This investment will fuel their expansion into new markets and verticals beyond digital media.

Subsets seamlessly integrates with a company's internal systems, gathering subscriber data points like demographics, content consumption patterns, and interactions with the product. This data is then analyzed to identify churn-prone audiences and suggest tailored retention strategies.

The platform's user-friendly interface allows non-technical teams to conduct retention experiments on specific subscriber subsets. These experiments might involve personalized push notifications, email offers, or free upgrades. The results are then analyzed to determine the most effective strategies for reducing churn.

Subsets' approach is grounded in mathematical modeling and computation. They've developed proprietary AI algorithms that combine multiple predictive models and incorporate time-related features. This enables them to understand the behaviors that drive churn and develop targeted interventions.

While Subsets doesn't currently utilize OpenAI's GPT.x models, they're exploring the integration of additional downstream functionality built on the same foundation as ChatGPT. This aligns with the growing trend among YC companies to leverage LLMs in various aspects of their operations.

YC's involvement as an early investor has opened doors for Subsets, connecting them with potential customers and partners. This network has been instrumental in their growth and expansion plans.

Subsets' pre-seed funding round also saw participation from institutional and angel investors, demonstrating the confidence in their mission to revolutionize subscriber retention.

In a world where customer acquisition costs are soaring, Subsets offers a lifeline to businesses seeking predictable revenue streams. Their AI-driven platform empowers companies to retain subscribers, optimize their retention strategies, and ultimately achieve sustainable growth.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"

In a landmark case that could reshape the digital landscape, the Supreme Court is deliberating the fate of two state laws that seek to restrict social media companies' content moderation practices.

At the heart of the debate lies the question of whether these laws infringe upon the First Amendment rights of both the platforms and their users. The justices grappled with the complexities of modern-day content moderation, acknowledging the vast and ever-evolving nature of the internet.

The laws, crafted by Republican lawmakers, stem from accusations of anti-conservative bias against social media giants. However, research has not substantiated these claims. Ironically, conservative social media users are more susceptible to political misinformation, potentially contributing to the perception of ideological discrepancies in content moderation.

The legal battle has unearthed outdated precedents, highlighting the need for clarity in an era dominated by digital communication. The justices expressed skepticism towards the broad nature of the state laws, recognizing their potential unintended consequences.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor aptly pointed out the sweeping reach of the laws, encompassing a wide range of online platforms, including marketplaces like Etsy. Justice Brett Kavanaugh emphasized the First Amendment's protection against government suppression of speech, a point echoed by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who cited Section 230, a law safeguarding internet companies' content moderation decisions.

However, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito appeared more receptive to the states' arguments, questioning whether content moderation was merely a euphemism for censorship.

The outcome of this case remains uncertain, with the possibility of a decisive ruling or a remand to lower courts for further proceedings. The Supreme Court's decision will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the future of content moderation and the broader digital landscape.

This case underscores the urgent need for the Supreme Court to address the evolving legal framework surrounding the internet age. Precedents rooted in traditional media, such as cable TV and newspapers, fall short in addressing the complexities of modern internet businesses with vast user bases.

The court's ruling will set a precedent for how social media companies navigate the delicate balance between free speech, misinformation, and user safety. It will also determine the extent to which state governments can regulate online content, potentially shaping the future of digital discourse and the broader internet ecosystem.

In a world where everyone has a story to tell, Inkitt, an ambitious startup, aims to transform the most captivating tales into blockbusters and establish a modern-day ""Disney"" empire. With $37 million in fresh funding, Inkitt is poised to expand its horizons and revolutionize the entertainment landscape.

Inkitt's journey began with a self-publishing app, empowering aspiring writers to share their stories with the world. Leveraging AI and data science, the platform identifies the most compelling narratives, fine-tunes them, and distributes them through a dedicated app called Galatea. This innovative approach has already attracted 33 million users and produced numerous bestsellers.

The new funding will fuel Inkitt's expansion into diverse content formats. The company plans to harness AI to generate stories based on original ideas, personalize fiction for individual readers, venture into games and audiobooks, and adapt its published works into captivating videos. Initially produced with human involvement, these videos will eventually be generated entirely by AI.

CEO and founder Ali Albazaz envisions Inkitt as a multimedia empire, akin to a 21st-century Disney, rather than a competitor to platforms like Wattpad. This vision has attracted the attention of prominent investors, including Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, NEA, Kleiner Perkins, Redalpine, and undisclosed backers.

Inkitt's unique approach challenges the declining trend in reading. By embracing mobile devices, creating shorter and easily digestible chapters, and incorporating immersive effects, Inkitt aims to capture readers' attention and engagement. Additionally, the platform conducts extensive A/B testing to optimize every aspect of a story, from titles and plotlines to cliffhangers. This data-driven approach enables Inkitt to identify successful storytelling techniques and apply them to future publications.

Despite the post-pandemic decline in certain digital services, Inkitt, Galatea, and Galatea TV have experienced a surge in engagement. Albazaz attributes this success to people's desire for escapism in a fast-paced world. Inkitt's ranking as the 11th best-selling publisher globally, surpassing established names like Penguin Random House, further validates its effectiveness.

Inkitt's focus on undiscovered talent sets it apart from traditional publishing houses. Albazaz believes in nurturing the ""long tail"" of writers rather than catering to big names and egos. The company's commitment to higher royalties for authors, compared to traditional publishers, further solidifies its dedication to supporting emerging talent.

Inkitt's exploration of AI-generated stories, crafted from captivating treatments by human writers, adds another layer of innovation. The company is also experimenting with personalizing stories based on readers' preferences, potentially giving readers control over the narrative. To achieve these goals, Inkitt collaborates with various LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI, while developing its own customizations.

Inkitt's prudent approach to IP protection is evident in its reliance on multiple LLMs and strategic prompting to prevent over-reliance on any single platform. This strategy ensures that Inkitt maintains control over its best-selling content.

Vinod Khosla's investment in Inkitt reflects his belief in the future of hyper-personalized entertainment. Inkitt's mission aligns perfectly with Khosla's vision, making it an ideal partnership.

Inkitt's journey towards building an AI-powered content empire is well underway. With a dedicated team, innovative ideas, and strategic partnerships, the company is poised to revolutionize the entertainment industry and redefine the way we consume stories.

In the realm of gadgets, the Ring Car Cam faced an identity crisis from the moment it hit the market. Amazon's decision to discontinue the product after three and a half years comes as no surprise to industry watchers.

The Ring Car Cam aspired to be more than just a surveillance device; it aimed to be an extension of the home security ecosystem, a sentinel on wheels that would seamlessly integrate with the automotive space. However, the question of its target audience remained unanswered. Was it meant for security-conscious homeowners, tech-savvy car enthusiasts, or a broader demographic? This ambiguity proved to be a significant hurdle for the device.

While the Ring Car Cam had innovative features, such as the use of the OBD-II port and the ""traffic stop"" mode, it struggled to justify its $199 price tag and the $6 monthly subscription fee. In the dashcam market, there were more affordable options with higher resolution and continuous recording capabilities.

Moreover, the Ring Car Cam's appeal was limited to those deeply invested in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. While Alexa has a vast user base, it's unlikely that many were willing to entrust the safety of their vehicles to a device heavily reliant on voice commands.

Amazon's decision to discontinue the Ring Car Cam highlights the challenges of adding value in a market where price is a key factor. It also raises questions about consumer expectations regarding dashcams and automotive security devices. As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, consumers may expect always-on video coverage of their vehicles.

Tesla's Sentry Mode, which promised remote access through the Ring Car Connect product, failed to gain traction. The discontinuation of the Ring Car Cam further diminishes the likelihood of this project's success.

The Ring Car Cam's demise serves as a reminder that even in the rapidly evolving world of gadgets, clearly defining the target audience and offering compelling value are essential for success.

Hadrian's Success in Automating CNC Machining:
In parallel with this lunar triumph, Hadrian, a company specializing in automating high-precision CNC machining, secured $117 million in funding. This investment will enable Hadrian to expand its software and automation teams, establish a second factory, and cater to the growing customer demand for its innovative solutions.

Understanding the 51-Year Gap:
For those who question why it took so long for the US to return to the moon, Bloomberg's Loren Grush provides an insightful explanation. Grush emphasizes that the technology used in the 1970s is vastly different from today's advancements in software, compute, robotics, and materials. The current missions involve pioneering new technologies that require meticulous refinement and maturation.

Mariner 6's Historic Mission to Mars:
On February 25, 1969, NASA launched Mariner 6, a spacecraft designed to explore Mars. Five months later, the spacecraft reached the red planet, capturing valuable data on its atmosphere and surface. Mariner 6, along with its twin Mariner 7, relayed dozens of photographs back to Earth, providing crucial insights into Mars' enigmatic landscape.

Conclusion:
The successful landing of Odysseus on the moon is a testament to human ingenuity and the unwavering pursuit of space exploration.

Reddit IPO: A Tale of Meme Stocks, Power Users, and the Future of Social Media

In the realm of social media, Reddit stands out as a unique platform where content thrives due to the contributions of its dedicated users and unpaid moderators. As the company prepares to go public, it has made an unprecedented move by offering shares in its IPO to 75,000 of its most active members, a group known as ""power users."" This decision has sparked excitement and speculation among Redditors, who see the potential for Reddit to become the next meme stock.

The Allure of Meme Stocks and Reddit's Loyal Community

Meme stocks, often fueled by online communities like Reddit's r/WallStreetBets, have made headlines for their rapid rise and unpredictable behavior. These stocks, typically associated with low-performing companies, experience sudden surges in value due to coordinated buying by retail investors. The potential for significant gains has made meme stocks a hot topic among investors, and Reddit's loyal community could play a significant role in shaping the fate of its own IPO.

Reddit's Potential as a Search Engine and Investment Opportunity

Beyond the meme stock allure, Reddit's potential as a search engine has caught the attention of investors. With Google facing criticism for its low-quality results, Reddit has emerged as a viable alternative for users seeking more relevant and community-driven information. This potential has attracted investors like Gillian Tahajian, who sees Reddit as a promising investment opportunity.

The Delicate Relationship Between Reddit and Its Power Users

Reddit's relationship with its power users has been strained in recent times. Controversial API changes alienated many subreddits, leading to widespread protests and disruptions on the platform. However, Reddit's offer to involve users in its IPO is seen as an attempt to mend fences and acknowledge the crucial role they play in the platform's success.

Reddit's Path to Profitability and the Skeptics' Perspective

While Reddit's IPO has generated excitement, there are skeptics who question the company's ability to turn a profit. Reddit's global daily active users have shown impressive growth, but it still lags behind other social media giants like Twitter. The company's reliance on advertising and licensing data to Google raises concerns about its long-term sustainability.

The Meme Stock Threat and the Rationality of Irrationality

For some investors, the potential for Reddit to become a meme stock is a deterrent. The volatility and unpredictability associated with meme stocks can lead to significant losses. However, others see the meme stock phenomenon as an opportunity to capitalize on irrational market behavior. As Jeremiah Johnson, a Reddit power user, puts it, ""This might just be the next meme stock. Regardless of whether or not this technically makes sense, if this is a thing that's going to happen, you might as well get in.""

Conclusion

Reddit's IPO has ignited a mix of excitement and skepticism among investors. The company's decision to involve its power users in the IPO is a unique move that highlights the importance of community engagement in the social media landscape. Whether Reddit will become the next meme stock or a profitable investment remains to be seen, but the company's potential as a search engine and its loyal user base make it an intriguing prospect for investors.

In the realm of cybercrime, the notorious LockBit ransomware group has made a striking comeback after a brief hiatus caused by a global law enforcement operation. The group's reappearance on the dark web, complete with a new leak site and a string of fresh victims, has raised questions about the effectiveness of the takedown.

LockBit's resurgence stems from the group's ability to restore its operations from unaffected backups, a testament to its resilience and adaptability. This swift recovery underscores the challenges law enforcement faces in dismantling sophisticated cybercriminal networks.

The group's administrator, known as LockBitSupp, has responded defiantly, vowing retaliation against the government sector and threatening to escalate its attacks. This bold stance sets the stage for an ongoing battle between LockBit and law enforcement agencies worldwide.

The National Crime Agency (NCA), which spearheaded Operation Cronos, maintains that it has compromised LockBit's systems and disrupted its criminal activities. However, LockBit's continued operations and its administrator's defiant tone suggest otherwise.

The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and cybercriminals continues, with both sides making bold claims and promises. The NCA has promised to reveal the identity of LockBitSupp, the group's elusive leader, while U.S. authorities have offered a multimillion-dollar reward for information leading to his capture.

Despite these efforts, LockBit's resilience mirrors that of other notorious ransomware gangs like ALPHV (BlackCat), Hive, and Conti. These groups have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, rebranding and reforming under different names after law enforcement crackdowns.

LockBit's administrator remains at large, and the group's infrastructure remains intact, indicating that its demise may have been prematurely announced. The group's vow to upgrade its security measures and continue its affiliate program further highlights its determination to persist.

Law enforcement's acknowledgment that it's still working to disrupt LockBit suggests that the group's threat is far from over. The ongoing battle between LockBit and law enforcement serves as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of cybercrime and the challenges in combating it.

iPhone 16 and 17: A Glimpse into the Future of Apple's Display Technology

Apple's iPhone 15 and 15 Plus boast stunning displays that are pin-sharp, blur-free, and color-faithful. However, their 60Hz refresh rate falls short compared to many rivals, including Apple's own iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. This disparity will soon change, but there's a catch: you'll have to wait until 2025.

The 60Hz refresh rate on non-Pro iPhones has been a source of frustration for some users. Many rival phones, even those cheaper than the iPhone, have already switched to faster refresh rates. Apple, however, has reserved ProMotion screens exclusively for its Pro iPhones.

According to a recent report in The Elec, spotted by MacRumors, Apple plans to continue using 60Hz displays with Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon technology in this fall's iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. However, with the iPhone 17 series, the company intends to switch to Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide panels across the board.

One might wonder why this matters, given that the current 60Hz displays look impressive. Apple has consistently delivered excellent displays since the introduction of the first Retina Display on the iPhone 4. The company's expertise in optimizing panels has resulted in stunning visuals.

However, ProMotion displays with dynamically changing refresh rates offer another significant benefit: the Always-On feature. This feature allows the iPhone 15 Pro, for example, to display the time, date, widgets, and a subtle version of the lock screen wallpaper even when the screen is off. This convenience eliminates the need to tap the phone repeatedly to check the time or other information.

ProMotion's ability to adjust the refresh rate from a buttery-smooth 120Hz for scrolling and video playback down to a power-saving 1Hz for static content makes this effect possible.

Additionally, iOS 17 introduces a handy feature called StandBy. When an iPhone is charging and placed on its side, such as on a compatible wireless charger, the display can show the time, calendar, photos, and widgets. The screen remains active for a short period, but a tap or a gentle nudge brings it back to life.

However, the always-on display truly shines on the iPhone 14 Pro, Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, and Pro Max, keeping the screen on indefinitely. This is a feature that regular iPhones currently lack.

The wait for this feature on non-Pro iPhones will soon be over, as Apple plans to introduce it with the iPhone 17 series next year. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting development!

While the number of dealerships has remained relatively stable, the number of franchises offered by those dealerships has decreased. This indicates a consolidation of brands within dealerships, allowing them to offer a wider range of vehicles under one roof.

The study also revealed a significant increase in throughput, which is the average number of vehicles sold by a dealership each year. This surge in throughput is attributed to the adaptability of dealers, who quickly embraced digital tools and innovative sales strategies to navigate the challenges posed by the Covid pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and semiconductor chip shortages.

The Importance of Physical Dealerships: A Personal Touch

Despite the rise of online car sales, physical dealerships continue to hold their ground due to several key factors. Customers still prefer the personal touch and face-to-face interaction that dealerships provide. They want to see the car in person, test drive it, and negotiate the price directly with a salesperson.

Millennials, in particular, have shown a strong preference for traditional dealerships. They value the ability to visit a showroom, inspect the vehicle thoroughly, and receive expert advice from knowledgeable sales staff.

The Future of Dealerships: Embracing Electrification

As the automotive industry transitions towards electrification, dealerships are faced with the challenge of adapting to this new era. Urban Science cautions dealers to carefully analyze sales data trends before making major investments in electric vehicle infrastructure. However, they also emphasize the importance of being prepared to sell and service electrified vehicles in the near future.

Conclusion: The Enduring Strength of Physical Dealerships

In a world where digitalization is rapidly transforming industries, the resilience of brick-and-mortar auto dealerships is a testament to their enduring strength. Dealerships have successfully adapted to changing consumer preferences, economic challenges, and technological advancements, proving that they will continue to play a crucial role in the car-buying process for years to come.

In a remarkable debut on the Korea Exchange, shares of South Korean beauty-device manufacturer APR soared by 27%, propelling the company's valuation to an impressive 2.4 trillion won ($1.8 billion). The initial public offering (IPO) saw APR raise 94.8 billion won ($71 million) by offering 379,000 shares at 250,000 won each, exceeding the anticipated range of 147,000 won to 200,000 won per share. The shares closed at a commendable 317,500 won on the first trading day.

APR intends to utilize the IPO proceeds strategically. The company plans to expand its production facilities, bolster overseas marketing efforts (with a focus on social media influencers) in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, and China, and invest in research and development to maintain its innovative edge.

Before the IPO, APR garnered support from notable investors, including CJ Onstyle (part of Korean billionaire Lee Jay-hyun's CJ Group), SJ Investment Partners (a Korean VC firm with investments in AI chip startup DeepX and serialized fiction app Radish), and the state-owned Industrial Bank of Korea. The company achieved unicorn status when CJ Onstyle invested in June 2022, propelling APR to new heights.

APR, headquartered in Seoul's iconic Lotte World Tower, was co-founded in 2014 by Byunghoon Kim and Lee Ju-kwang. The dynamic duo was recognized on Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia list in 2017. While Lee departed from the company in 2019, Kim, known as Victor in English, remains the CEO and the largest shareholder, holding a substantial 35% stake.

APR has gained recognition for its Medicube Age-R brand products, particularly the Booster Healer devices. These devices employ electrical stimulation to enhance the skin's absorption of skincare products. The Medicube Age-R Booster-H, launched in 2022, gained significant traction after receiving a glowing endorsement from model, entrepreneur, and wife of pop star Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, in a TikTok video. As of November 2023, APR has sold an impressive 1.6 million Medicube Age-R products both domestically and internationally.

Beauty devices have been the driving force behind APR's impressive revenue growth. In the first three quarters of 2023, beauty devices accounted for a remarkable 82% of the company's 372 billion won (approximately $280 million) revenue, nearly matching the revenue generated in all of 2022. APR's fashion unit, Nerdy, and photo booth business contributed to the remaining revenue. Notably, the company's net income for the period surged to 57 billion won, a significant increase from the 30 billion won recorded in fiscal 2022, largely attributed to reduced expenses.

APR's global reach extends beyond South Korea, with approximately 40% of its products sold internationally. The company's fastest-growing markets include mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the U.S. APR is actively preparing to enter new markets such as France, India, Qatar, Thailand, and the U.K., further expanding its global footprint.

CEO Kim attributes APR's success to its technological edge and innovative product lineup. The company operates a dedicated corporate R&D center, ADC (APR Device Center), and holds around 70 patents related to beauty devices' electricity technology. APR is committed to developing cutting-edge technology that enhances product efficiency. In addition to ADC, APR established the Global Dermatological Research Institute in Seoul in 2020 and its own factory in Seoul in April 2023, further solidifying its commitment to innovation.

Kim emphasizes APR's focus on continuous product development. ""We are not a company that relies on one hit item and sells it repeatedly,"" he says. ""We have launched seven beauty devices so far, and for the seventh, named Booster Pro, we combined our know-how and experience from the previous six devices."" APR plans to introduce another skincare device in the first half of 2024 and three to four new devices by the end of the year, ensuring a steady stream of innovative products.

To accommodate the growing demand for its devices, APR is constructing a second factory, slated for completion in the second quarter of 2024. Located in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, the new facility will boost the company's production capacity to eight million units annually.

The global market for at-home beauty devices is poised for significant growth, estimated to reach $34.8 billion by 2030, up from $5.5 billion in 2024. Kim believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of home beauty devices as people spent less time外出 and beauty clinics were closed. He sees a shift in consumer behavior, with individuals now considering home devices as a viable alternative to visiting beauty clinics.

The beauty industry has been a wealth creator on a global scale. Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, the granddaughter of the founder of L'Oreal, is the richest woman in the world with a net worth of $98.6 billion. The Lauder family behind Estée Lauder ranks among the wealthiest families in America, with a combined fortune of $25.9 billion. In South Korea, two beauty billionaires made it to the list of the country's top 50 richest people: Suh Kyung-bae of Amorepacific and Kim Jung-woong of GP Club.

In the realm of eating disorders, a rare condition known as Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) has seen a dramatic surge in the United Kingdom. The charity Beat, dedicated to supporting individuals with eating disorders, has witnessed a sevenfold increase in calls related to ARFID over the past five years. This alarming trend highlights the growing need for awareness, understanding, and specialized support for individuals struggling with this disorder.

ARFID is characterized by a persistent avoidance of certain foods or a severely restricted diet, leading to nutritional deficiencies, malnutrition, and social difficulties. Unlike other eating disorders, ARFID is not driven by body image concerns but rather by sensory sensitivities, fear of eating due to traumatic experiences, or a lack of interest in food.

The impact of ARFID can be devastating, with individuals experiencing weight loss, fatigue, and a diminished quality of life. Tragically, a recent case involving the death of an autistic boy due to severe malnutrition brought to light the lack of awareness and support for ARFID among healthcare professionals.

While ARFID can affect people of all ages, it commonly develops in infancy or early childhood. Fussy eating is a normal phase for many children, but for those with ARFID, the restricted diet becomes so severe that it compromises their nutritional needs and overall well-being.

Raising awareness about ARFID is crucial to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. During Eating Disorders Awareness Week, organizations and healthcare providers are working to educate the public and professionals about this often-misunderstood condition.

Families affected by ARFID share their struggles and triumphs, shedding light on the challenges and the transformative power of specialized care. One parent recounts their daughter's rapid decline in appetite, weight loss, and overall health. With the help of a dedicated specialist team, she gradually regained weight, improved her physical and mental state, and expanded the variety of foods she could eat.

The journey towards recovery from ARFID requires patience, support, and a tailored approach. With the right care and understanding, individuals with ARFID can regain their vitality, improve their quality of life, and reclaim the joy of eating.

In the realm of AI assistants, the Humane Ai Pin stands out as a groundbreaking hardware device. Yet, its presence at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona left me perplexed. Instead of a booth, the company opted for a dispersed team of engineers and designers showcasing the Ai Pin within partner spaces.

Amidst the vibrant magenta walls of T-Mobile's AI concept phone, I encountered the enigmatic duo, Sai Kambampati and Liz Dorman, demonstrating the Ai Pin's capabilities. Donning a black Humane hoodie and a white Ai Pin, Kambampati engaged in a captivating demo.

With a simple tap on the Pin's surface, he posed a question: ""How many people attend Mobile World Congress?"" The Pin, paired with a concealed speaker, promptly responded with an accurate figure. For more complex queries, the Pin provided a reassuring ""Searching for attendees"" message while scouring the web for information.

The Pin's swift response times impressed me, particularly in the context of a bustling trade show. However, the need for an additional speaker raised concerns about the volume of the built-in audio. Nevertheless, I realized that broadcasting conversations with the wearable wouldn't be a frequent occurrence.

The true showstopper of the Ai Pin is its Laser Ink Display, projecting information onto the user's raised palm. This ingenious feature offers a discreet and futuristic way to receive answers without verbalizing them. The 3D sensor and mapping technology ensured that the projection remained centered and legible, even with hand movements.

While the live demos piqued my interest, questions lingered about the practicality of juggling a smartphone and the Ai Pin. The $699 price tag and $24 monthly subscription might deter many potential buyers, including myself.

However, I recognize the immense value of an always-accessible AI companion in situations where context is crucial. Imagine effortlessly obtaining currency conversions, directions, or nearby pharmacy locations without fumbling with your phone. The Humane Ai Pin offers a compelling solution for such scenarios.
