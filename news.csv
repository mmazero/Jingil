In the wake of Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition, a microblogging site called Post News made its debut. However, it has recently been announced that this platform will cease operations merely a year and a half after its initial beta release. Noam Bardin, founder of Post News (previously CEO of Waze), shared the unfortunate developments via a farewell post last Friday.

The objective behind Post News was to capitalize on Twitter's status as a hub for journalists to congregate and exchange ideas, thereby establishing itself as an innovative avenue for publishers and authors to generate revenue. Rather than requiring users to subscribe to multiple publications, Post News enabled them to buy individual articles from selected partner outlets.

Although Post News is closing its doors, Bardin acknowledges some valuable insights gained through the process. Among these learnings is the validation of the potential for digital news organizations to explore alternative methods of monetization—particularly micropayments and user tips for content creators. As Bardin puts it, ""Post validated many theories around micropayments and consumers' willingness to purchase individual articles.""

Indeed, the media industry is undergoing transformation, giving rise to an increasing number of independent and cooperatively owned publications utilizing technology platforms such as Substack, Beehiiv, and Ghost. Nevertheless, capturing this emerging trend within a single social platform might have proven premature.

Interestingly, Post News wasn't alone in attempting to seize opportunities presented by Twitter alternates during the same period when several other contenders joined the fray to cater to those unhappy with Musk's leadership choices. Despite Post News surviving over a year following its launch, it isn't the sole new microblogging site that has met its demise; Pebble, also known as T2, closed shop in October.

Reflecting on Post News' journey serves as a reminder that success in social media is far from guaranteed—even if a platform manages to attract a substantial user base initially, transforming that interest into long-term engagement remains a formidable challenge.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/post-news-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-19 19:13:22,"Discover how Post News aimed to revolutionize digital revenue generation but ultimately failed.

They highlight the threat of AI-manipulated content (deepfakes and cheapfakes) to India's elections and the need to combat this issue.","Title: Tackling Misinformation in India's Elections: A Battle Against Deepfakes and Cheapfakes

Introduction

As India embarks on the world's most extensive democratic exercise—its nine-phase general election taking place between April 11th and May 19th, 2023—the process faces unprecedented challenges due to the rising tide of misinformation. With more than 830 million internet users and a vibrant social media ecosystem, India grapples with an influx of misleading information, often amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as deepfakes and cheapfakes. This article explores the current state of misinformation surrounding India's elections, focusing on the emergence of AI-manipulated content and the efforts to combat this issue.

Deepfakes and Their Impact on Election Integrity

India ranks high in terms of vulnerability to misinformation, given its diverse linguistic and cultural landscape combined with widespread internet usage. According to the Word Economic Forum, India holds the top position when it comes to susceptibility to misinformation and disinformation risks. Unfortunately, recent advancements in technology, specifically AI, have exacerbated the challenge posed by deepfake content.

Deepfakes refer to hyper-realistic synthetic media produced using machine learning algorithms and large datasets containing images or recordings of real individuals. These fabrications threaten election integrity by spreading false narratives, distorting reality, and influencing voter perceptions. But the dangers of deepfakes extend beyond mere election interference; they can lead to physical harm, stoke tensions, and fuel prejudice toward marginalized communities.

Cheapfakes: Another Threat to Democracy

Alongside deepfakes, another form of deceptive media known as 'cheapfakes' undermines India's electoral processes. Hamsini Hariharan, a researcher at the UK-based fact-checking firm Logically, defines cheapfakes as content altered through relatively simple means, such as editing images, videos, or audio files. Although lacking the technical finesse of deepfakes, cheapfakes remain potent tools capable of sowing discord and confusion amongst voters.

An Increase in Online Misinformation

Since India's previous general election in 2019, instances of online misinformation have surged dramatically. Several factors contribute to this upsurge, notably the growth in internet accessibility and technological advances enabling the production of convincing yet fraudulent multimedia content. Additionally, lower levels of media literacy coupled with diminishing trust in traditional journalism intensify the impact of such propaganda.

A notable example involves attempts to undermine confidence in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Over the past few months, various posts claiming EVM tampering and malfunctions have surfaced on social media platforms, accompanied by hashtags such as 'BanEVM.' Such campaigns aim to sway public opinion negatively regarding the reliability of electronic voting systems and thereby question the legitimacy of election outcomes.

Combatting Misinformation: Efforts From Stakeholders

To counteract the influence of deepfakes and other forms of misinformation, several stakeholders must collaborate, including governments, tech giants, and independent fact-checking initiatives. In response to growing concerns, the Indian government amended its Information Technology Rules in 2022, requiring social media entities to take down misleading material within three days of receiving a complaint. Despite these regulatory developments, inconsistent enforcement remains a concern, prompting calls for greater clarity in legislation.

Meanwhile, major tech firms such as Google and Meta have pledged action to reduce the dissemination of misleading information during India's elections. They include restricting automated bot responses to election-related inquiries and partnering with third-party fact-checking agencies. Nevertheless, critics contend that these voluntary commitments lack teeth, urging both corporations and regulators to implement stricter guidelines and penalties for violations.

Conclusion

Misinformation continues to loom threateningly over India's elections, necessitating urgent attention and intervention from all involved parties. By leveraging advanced technologies such as deepfakes and cheapfakes, nefarious actors exploit societal divisions and erode trust in democratic institutions. To preserve free and fair elections, concerted efforts must focus on enhancing media literacy, improving transparency, and strengthening regulatory frameworks governing digital spaces.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/india-election-2024-getty.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-20 12:00:27,"Meta Description:

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, but building AI systems that can effectively collaborate with humans remains a challenge. A crucial part of enabling AI-human collaboration is understanding human behavior, which is often less than optimal due to computational constraints.

A team of researchers from MIT and the University of Washington has developed a method to model the behavior of a decision-making agent, whether human or machine, by inferring their computational constraints. This ""inference budget"" can predict an agent's future behavior based on their past actions.

The Need for Modeling Human Irrationality

Traditional AI models often assume optimal decision-making, which doesn't accurately represent human behavior. Humans have limited cognitive resources and can't spend decades contemplating the ideal solution to a single problem. To build AI systems that can collaborate with humans, it's essential to account for these computational constraints and the resulting suboptimal decision-making.

Inferring Inference Budgets

The researchers developed a model that infers an agent's inference budget by observing their past actions. This budget can then be used to predict future behavior. In a paper presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), the researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in inferring navigation goals from prior routes and predicting players' subsequent moves in chess matches.

Implications for AI-Human Collaboration

Understanding human behavior and inferring goals can significantly enhance AI assistants' utility. By predicting potential mistakes and adapting to human collaborators' weaknesses, AI systems can become more helpful and responsive.

Athul Paul Jacob, an EECS graduate student and lead author of the paper, explains, ""Being able to model human behavior is an important step toward building an AI agent that can actually help that human. If we know that a human is about to make a mistake, having seen how they have behaved before, the AI agent could step in and offer a better way to do it.""

Introduction

Researchers from the University of Bristol have recently made a groundbreaking discovery regarding the noise generation and propagation in futuristic aircraft engines known as Boundary Layer Ingesting (BLI) ducted fans. Their findings, published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, reveal vital information about these energy-efficient engines' noise characteristics, paving the way for quieter airframe-integrated propulsion systems in future aircraft concepts.

Understanding BLI Ducted Fans

Unlike traditional aircraft engines situated beneath the wings, BLI ducted fans are partially embedded into the plane's main body. These advanced engines draw air from both the front and the surface of the airframe, reducing their effort to move the aircraft and subsequently decreasing fuel consumption. While BLI ducted fans offer numerous benefits, such as increased efficiency and reduced fuel usage, their noise emissions pose a significant challenge in obtaining certification approvals.

Investigating Noise Sources

To address this critical issue, Dr. Feroz Ahmed and his team conducted extensive research using the University National Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Facility. Through careful examination, three primary noise sources were identified: the duct, the rotating fan, and the air flowing over the curved airframe surface.

Noise Pattern Variations

Interestingly, the noise pattern emitted by the BLI ducted fans varies based on the thrust being produced. At higher thrust levels, the noise pattern resembles that of typical fans without ducts. However, when the fan produces less thrust, the noise pattern transforms as the duct itself becomes a more prominent source of noise. By comprehending the physical processes behind these varying noise patterns, engineers can develop improved guidance for designing quieter integrated propulsion systems in future aircraft, ranging from conventional large-scale planes to smaller electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

Addressing the Knowledge Gap

While previous studies primarily focused on BLI configurations without ducts, limited research exists concerning ducted fans ingesting airflow from around curved airframe surfaces. To fill this void, Dr. Ahmed and his colleagues meticulously analyzed the various factors contributing to noise production in embedded ducted fans operating on curved surfaces. Projects such as the Bell X-22A, Embraer X, Airbus E-fan, Lilium Jet, Green Jet, and Hybrid Air Vehicle demonstrate the increasing popularity of these innovative systems for next-generation aircraft.

Experimental Setup and Data Collection

The researchers constructed a customized BLI test rig equipped with an electric ducted fan adjacent to a curved wall, simulating the configuration of embedded engines used in designs like the ONERA NOVA aircraft concept. Various data types were gathered from the rig, encompassing measurements of the fan's thrust output and associated noise generation.

Unlocking Noise Contributions

Through detailed analysis of the noise interaction mechanisms among multiple sources, the research successfully revealed the origins of noise and its transformation across different thrust levels. Furthermore, the study offers valuable insights for devising strategies to minimize noise pollution in the aviation industry and promoting a serene flying experience.

Conclusion

As the global demand for environmentally friendly transportation grows, so does the necessity for quieter aircraft. With far-reaching implications for the fluid mechanics community, this pioneering research provides essential understandings of noise generation in futuristic embedded ducted fans, ultimately facilitating the development of quieter next-generation aircraft design.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/silent-flight-edges-cl.jpg,2024-04-19 10:47:31,"""Uncover the secrets of silent flight: Explore Bristol researchers' findings on noise in futuristic aircraft engines.

Introduction

Vector databases are experiencing a surge in popularity, with numerous startups entering the field and investors eagerly supporting them. This trend can be attributed to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and the generative AI (GenAI) movement, which have created an ideal environment for vector database technologies to thrive. Traditional relational databases like Postgres or MySQL are excellent for structured data with predefined data types. However, they fall short when dealing with unstructured data, such as images, videos, emails, and social media posts, which don't adhere to a predefined data model. This is where vector databases shine.

Understanding Vector Databases

Vector databases store and process data in the form of vector embeddings, converting text, documents, images, and other data into numerical representations that capture the meaning and relationships between different data points. This spatial organization of data by relevance makes it easier to retrieve semantically similar data, making vector search particularly useful for LLMs and real-time applications like content recommendations in social networks or e-commerce apps.

Vector search can help reduce ""hallucinations"" in LLM applications by providing additional information not available in the original training dataset. According to Andre Zayarni, CEO and co-founder of vector search startup Qdrant, ""Vector databases come into play when there's a large dataset, and you need a tool to work with vector embeddings in an efficient and convenient way.""

Growth and Investments in Vector Database Startups

Qdrant secured $28 million in funding in January, becoming one of the top 10 fastest-growing commercial open-source startups last year. Other vector database startups, such as Vespa, Weaviate, Pinecone, and Chroma, raised a combined $200 million last year for various vector offerings.

Recent developments include Index Ventures leading a $9.5 million seed round into Superlinked, a platform transforming complex data into vector embeddings. Lantern, a startup selling a hosted vector search engine for Postgres, was unveiled in Y Combinator's Winter '24 cohort.
