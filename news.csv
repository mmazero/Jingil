https://www.engadget.com/the-white-house-tells-nasa-to-create-a-new-time-zone-for-the-moon-193957377.html,The White House tells NASA to create a new time zone for the Moon,Coordinated Lunar Time: A New Era of Space Exploration,"

A New Era of Space Exploration: Coordinated Lunar Time

In a significant step towards the future of space exploration, the White House recently announced the creation of a new time standard for the Moon. Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) will be an official time reference to guide future lunar missions and ensure safety and accuracy in space operations. The memo, directed by NASA, outlines the plan to implement LTC by December 31, 2026, with the coordination of various government departments and international partners.

The Need for Celestial Time Standards

The creation of LTC is crucial to the success of space missions, particularly for the Moon and Mars. As Einstein's theories of relativity dictate, time changes relative to speed and gravity. As a result, time moves slightly faster on the Moon, which presents challenges for precise timing and synchronization of technology and missions. A consistent definition of time among operators in space is vital for successful space situational awareness capabilities, navigation, and communications, which are the foundation for interoperability across the US government and with international partners.

Coordinated Lunar Time vs. Coordinated Universal Time

The White House wants LTC to coordinate with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the standard by which all Earth's time zones are measured. UTC is the most widely used time standard in the world, and its adoption will enable accurate navigation and scientific endeavors. The memo also emphasizes the importance of LTC's resilience if it loses contact with Earth while providing scalability for space environments ""beyond the Earth-Moon system.""

NASA's Artemis Program

The Artemis program, launched by NASA, aims to send crewed missions back to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s. With the creation of LTC, the program will have a consistent time standard to guide its mission, ensuring the safety and success of its objectives. The launch of Artemis 2, with four people onboard, is currently set for September 2025, and Artemis 3, which plans to put humans back on the Moon's surface, is scheduled for 2026.

A Race to the Moon and Beyond

The creation of LTC is not only significant for NASA but also for other countries. China, the United States' primary competitor in space exploration, aims to put astronauts on the Moon before 2030. Other countries, including India, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, South Korea, and private companies, have also demonstrated lunar ambitions in recent years. While India and Russia have already placed modules and rovers on the Moon, their missions have not been as successful as NASA's.

The Future of Space Exploration

The creation of LTC marks the beginning of a new era of space exploration, with the Moon serving as a critical stop on the way to Mars. The Moon will facilitate further scientific exploration, technological establishment, and resource mining. Moreover, it will provide fuel and supply needs for eventual human missions to the Red Planet. As the world continues to race to space, the creation of LTC will help ensure the safety and accuracy of future space missions, ultimately paving the way for the colonization of other planets.

Conclusion

The creation of Coordinated Lunar Time is a crucial step towards the future of space exploration. With the coordination of various government departments and international partners, LTC will provide a consistent time standard for space missions and enable accurate navigation and scientific endeavors. As the world continues to race to space, the creation of LTC marks the beginning of a new era of space exploration, with the Moon serving as a critical stop on the way to Mars.

Building a Working Selenium-Silicon Tandem Solar Cell: A Promising Step Towards Increasing Solar Cell Efficiency

Solar cells have come a long way in revolutionizing electricity generation. Their ability to harness energy from the sun has led to a significant reduction in reliance on fossil fuels and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. However, despite their efficiency, solar cells still have a lot of room for improvement. Currently, they capture approximately 27% of the energy in the sunlight that hits them, which is near the theoretical limit for such technology.

To address these inefficiencies, researchers have been exploring the idea of adding layers of other materials that also capture energy by increasing the wavelengths that can be absorbed. A new study by a team of physicists and engineers at Technical University of Denmark is a promising step towards increasing the efficiency of solar cells to 40%.

The team turned to selenium, a semiconducting material that was used to make solar cells before scientists discovered that silicon was more suitable. The researchers chose it because it has different photon-absorbing properties, which allows for the creation of a dual-material solar cell, and it has a wide bandgap.

To make the cell, the researchers created a sandwich. They started with a standard silicon base, added some oxide layers, and then added a thin film of selenium. They placed it in sunlight, and it was able to generate 1.68 volts of electricity with a conversion efficiency of 2.7%.

The research team describes their tandem cell as promising, noting that its efficiency could be increased by 10 times simply by improving resistance, which would lower the loss of voltage. Their calculations suggest that refinement of the cell should at some point lead to an efficiency rating of approximately 40%.

This study highlights the importance of continued research and development in the field of solar energy. By exploring new materials and technologies, we can continue to improve the efficiency of solar cells and further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

For every successful tech venture, there are countless others that crash into the harsh reality of innovation. Apple's foray into electric vehicles is a prime example, but the tech giant isn't deterred. With the Apple Car seemingly in the rearview mirror, Apple is now reportedly exploring the challenging realm of home robots.

The home robot category is unique and notoriously difficult for several reasons. It's a field that has seen only one major success story in the past 22 years - the Roomba robot vacuum. Despite numerous attempts to replicate this success, companies like iRobot have found it challenging to strike gold twice.

iRobot's failure to repeat its initial success is not due to lack of effort. Since the introduction of the Roomba, iRobot has introduced a range of products, from gutter cleaners to pool cleaners, lawn mowers, and even a Roomba designed for garage floors. However, the company has fared best when it focused on its core product - the robot vacuum.

The success of the robot vacuum can be attributed to its single-task functionality, which it performs repetitively to the best of its ability. Despite advancements in technology, vacuums remain the primary battlefield in the home robot wars.

Matic, a well-funded Bay Area startup, believes the next breakthrough in home robotics will be built on the foundation of robot vacuums. The company's argument is that iRobot's puck-like form factor has limited its potential. By increasing the robot's height, the vantage point improves significantly, as demonstrated by Amazon's Astro home robot with its periscope camera.

However, home robot functionality is often limited by its form factor. The prevalent hockey puck design of robot vacuums is not ideal for tasks beyond their core functionality. To effectively perform more complex tasks, the hardware needs to become more complex. This is where mobile manipulators come in.

Mobile manipulators, or robots with movable arms, are a promising moving target. However, they are deceptively difficult to perfect. Industrial robotics has yet to crack this nut, with bolted-down arms common in manufacturing and wheeled autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) prevalent in warehouses.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180327_daisy_sl_batterycoolingbackviewbambam_001799-print.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-03 22:22:32,"""Discover the future of home robots!

Biofilm is a problematic issue in underwater applications, causing significant costs to the United States Navy and impacting the performance of ships and other oceanographic equipment.

The researchers used ultraviolet (UV) radiation to create a glass surface that reduces 98% of biofilm growth. The glass was treated with UV light from inside the surface, which bounced off light-scattering nanoparticles and through the glass interior. The glass was then submerged in the waters of Port Canaveral, Florida, for 20 days, and the results were compared to untreated glass.

The findings of the study suggest that this new glass technology can be used for disinfection of transparent surfaces, such as windows of ships, flotation spheres, and moored buoys, camera lenses and sensors for oceanographic, agricultural, and water treatment applications. The team has received a provisional patent for their discovery, and they are excited to optimize their discovery by testing long-term applications, assessing any effects on the environment, and creating larger surface areas.

The development of this new glass technology is a significant breakthrough in the fight against biofilm growth in underwater environments.

Introduction

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill's Chemistry Department have developed a method to harvest and convert solar energy into high-energy compounds. This innovative approach could potentially produce environmentally friendly fuels, thereby mitigating the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. In their research paper, ""Methyl termination of p-Type silicon enables selective photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction by a molecular ruthenium catalyst,"" published in ACS Energy Letters, the team explains how they use a process called methyl termination to modify the surface of silicon – an essential component in solar cells – to improve its performance in converting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using sunlight.

The Power of Artificial Photosynthesis

The research is inspired by artificial photosynthesis, a process that mimics how plants convert carbon dioxide into energy-rich molecules using sunlight. This process has the potential to address two significant challenges in solar energy: intermittent availability and the need for raw materials to produce chemicals.

""One challenge with solar energy is that it's not always available when we have the highest need for it,"" explains Gabriella Bein, the paper's first author and a Ph.D. student in chemistry. ""Another challenge is that renewable electricity, like that from solar panels, doesn't directly provide the raw materials needed for making chemicals. Our goal is to store solar power in the form of liquid fuels that can be used later.""

Creating a More Efficient Conversion Process

To achieve this goal, the researchers used a ruthenium molecular catalyst with a specially chemically modified silicon photoelectrode. This combination facilitated the efficient conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide using light energy without producing unwanted byproducts, such as hydrogen gas. This increased the process's efficiency, making it more suitable for converting carbon dioxide into other substances.

The team discovered that when they ran experiments in a solution filled with carbon dioxide, they could produce carbon monoxide at 87% efficiency. This efficiency is comparable or better than systems using traditional metal electrodes",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/chemistry-researchers.jpg,2024-04-02 12:39:31,"Meta Description:

https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/gen-z-workers-say-they-get-better-career-advice-from-chatgpt/,Gen Z workers say they get better career advice from ChatGPT, Gen Z Seeks Better Career Advice from ChatGPT over Managers: The Shift in Career Guidance Landscape ,"The Evolving Nature of Career Advice for a New Generation

In today's rapidly changing work environment, the source of career advice is shifting. Gone are the days when career counselors, bosses, or experienced colleagues were the only go-to sources for guidance. A new generation, Gen Z, is redefining the landscape and seeking advice from unconventional sources. Let's delve into the reasons behind this shift and explore the implications for career development.

The Rise of Gen Z and Their Unique Priorities

Gen Z, currently accounting for approximately two billion of the world's population, will make up 27% of the workforce by 2023. This generation has distinct priorities when it comes to work, with work-life balance, remote working, and flexible leave topping their list. Moreover, Gen Z workers are more likely to change jobs if their needs aren't met, with some surveys indicating they could change jobs up to 10 times between the ages of 18 and 34.

Gen Z is also a values-driven cohort, with diversity, inclusion, and environmental impact being significant factors in their job choices. Given these unique priorities, it's not surprising that traditional career advice may not resonate with them.

The Decline of Traditional Career Advice

Studies show that Gen Z workers are not getting the career support they need in the workplace. One in five employees report never having career conversations with their managers, and 63% feel that their employers prioritize productivity over career development. Furthermore, 75% of Gen Z workers have received bad career advice, often from their own managers.

The ChatGPT Phenomenon

In response to this lack of support, Gen Z workers are turning to AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT for career advice. According to a Workplace Intelligence and INTOO study, 47% of Gen Z workers believe they receive better advice from ChatGPT than from their managers. However, while ChatGPT can be helpful for tasks like personalizing resumes, its data may be outdated or not relevant to Gen Z's specific concerns.

The Importance of Human Connection

Despite the convenience of AI platforms, they cannot replace the human connection and personalized guidance that comes from managers or career counselors.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-machine-enables-viability-vertical-axis.html,Machine learning enables viability of vertical-axis wind turbines, Machine Learning Optimizes Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines for Greater Efficiency ,"Title: Harnessing the Power of Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines: A Revolutionary Approach

Introduction

Imagine an industrial wind turbine, and you're likely picturing the windmill design, known as a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). However, the first wind turbines, developed in the Middle East around the 8th century for grinding grain, were vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT). These turbines, which spin perpendicular to the wind, have several advantages over their HAWT counterparts, including reduced noise, greater wind energy density, and less impact on wildlife. This article explores the potential of VAWTs and the innovative solutions that could bring them to the forefront of the wind energy market.

The Advantages of VAWTs

VAWTs have several distinct advantages over HAWTs. Due to their slower rotation speed, VAWTs are less noisy and achieve greater wind energy density, meaning they require less space for the same output both on- and off-shore. Additionally, the blades of VAWTs rotate laterally, making them more wildlife-friendly, as birds find it easier to avoid them compared to the downward-slicing blades of HAWTs.

Despite these advantages, VAWTs are largely absent from today's wind energy market. The reason for this comes down to an engineering problem: air flow control. Sébastien Le Fouest, a researcher in the School of Engineering Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Lab (UNFOLD), believes that this issue can be solved through sensor technology and machine learning.

A Promising Solution

In a paper published in Nature Communications, Le Fouest and UNFOLD head Karen Mulleners describe two optimal pitch profiles for VAWT blades, which result in a 200% increase in turbine efficiency and a 77% reduction in structure-threatening vibrations. This achievement represents the first experimental application of a genetic learning algorithm to determine the best pitch for a VAWT blade.

The researchers mounted sensors onto an actuating blade shaft to measure the air forces acting on it. By pitching the blade back and forth at different angles, speeds, and amplitudes, they generated series of ""pitch profiles."" A computer then ran a genetic algorithm, which performed over 3,500 experimental",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/machine-learning-enabl-1.jpg,2024-04-03 10:09:10,"Discover a 200% efficiency boost in Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines!

While Nvidia continues to dominate the market with its AI-focused hardware and software offerings, smaller players are not ready to concede defeat. Hailo, an Israeli startup, has recently launched a new energy-efficient gen AI accelerator for edge devices, called Hailo-10. This chip is designed to deploy gen AI applications across edge devices without relying on cloud data centers. Hailo claims that this will not only help maximize the performance of models on the devices but also deliver significant cost and energy savings.

In addition to the new gen AI-focused chip, Hailo also announced that it has secured an additional $120 million in funding, bringing its valuation to $1.2 billion. The funding round was led by new and existing investors from various industries.

Hailo-10 Gen AI accelerator is set to ship in the second quarter of 2024. The chip is designed to seamlessly integrate GenAI capabilities into users' daily lives, allowing them to utilize chatbots, copilots, and other emerging content generation tools with unparalleled flexibility and immediacy. This, in turn, enhances productivity and enriches lives.

What makes Hailo-10 unique is its ability to run GenAI services directly on targeted devices, supercharging their current and future CPUs. This allows users to generate marketing content, engage in full-fledged conversations with customers, and automate real-time translation or summarization services, among other things, directly on their PCs or other edge systems, without straining the CPU or draining the battery.

The Hailo-10 chip is capable of delivering up to 40 TOPS (tera operations per second), which is a new performance standard for edge AI accelerators. This makes it significantly more effective for inferencing than a GPU-based solution, both in terms of cost and in terms of power consumption, allowing it to be integrated into more compact systems at the edge.

In comparison, Nvidia's Jetson line of modules also handles edge AI workloads, with performance going up to 275 TOPS. However, that also increases power consumption. A comparable offering from Nvidia that targets entry-level edge AI apps is Jetson Orin Nano, which delivers up to 40 TOPS of AI performance with power options between 5W and 15W.

Overall, Hailo-10 is a significant milestone in the development of GenAI on the edge, and it has the potential to transform the security workforce by enabling more efficient and effective use of AI technologies.

Apple's Relentless Quest for the Next Big Thing

Apple has been on the hunt for the next revolutionary product to maintain its dominance in the market and to serve as a new source of revenue after abandoning its plans to develop an electric vehicle of its own. One of the areas the company is exploring is personal robotics. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple started looking into robots and electric vehicles at the same time, with the hopes of creating a machine that doesn't need human intervention.

While Apple's robotics projects are still in the early stages, the company has already started working on a mobile robot that can follow users around their home and has developed a table-top device that uses a robot to move a screen around. The idea behind the latter is to have a machine that can mimic head movements and can lock on to a single person in a group, presumably for a better video call experience. Since these robots are supposed to be able to move on their own, the company is also looking into the use of algorithms for navigation. Based on the report, Apple's home devices group is in charge of their development, and at least one engineer who worked on its scrapped EV initiative has joined the team.

However, robots aren't like phones in the sense that people these days need them in their lives. Apple is apparently worried about whether people would pay ""top dollar"" for the robots it has in mind, and executives still can't get to an agreement on whether the company should keep working on these projects. Gurman previously reported that Apple may have sold its EV for $100,000 - if that's true, it had a bigger potential to grow the company's revenue. But the Apple Car is now out of the picture, and the company is reportedly putting all of its focus on the Vision Pro and new products for the home, which also includes a home hub device with a display that resembles an iPad. Of course, Apple could still scrap these projects, and it could find other classes of products to invest in if it discovers that they could bring in bigger money in the future.

Introduction:

Sachin Bansal, co-founder of Flipkart, is reportedly in discussions with investors to raise capital for his Indian fintech startup, Navi, at a valuation of approximately $2 billion. This potential fundraising marks a significant milestone for the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has been primarily self-funded since its inception in 2018.

The Resurgence of Fintech and India's Startup Ecosystem:

The funding talks signal a revival in growth stage funding for fintech and startups in India. The country experienced a 73% decline in overall startup funding in 2023, with global investors like Tiger Global and SoftBank reducing their investments. However, recent developments suggest a thaw in the market, with prominent sovereign wealth funds like Abu Dhabi's ADIA and Malaysia's Khazanah showing interest in Indian startups.

Navi's Journey:

Navi, offering personal and home loans, health insurance, and other financial services, initially aimed to raise $440 million through an IPO. However, due to the slump in the IPO market, these plans were abandoned in 2022. The company has experienced its share of financial ups and downs, but the current funding discussions signify a potential turning point.

Bansal's Vision and Navi's Future:

Under Bansal's leadership, Flipkart was a pioneer in India's startup scene, raising billions from high-profile investors. After leaving Flipkart with a $1 billion windfall, Bansal adopted a bootstrapped approach for Navi, which he founded the same year. Despite this being Navi's first significant external fundraising, Bansal has reportedly held discussions with potential investors such as SoftBank.

Navi has recently narrowed its focus, selling its microfinancing unit Chaitanya India for $178.5 million in August 2022. Bansal has expressed his intention to revive Navi's IPO plans in the near future, depending on the startup's readiness.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-634332718.jpg?resize=1200,781",2024-04-04 06:31:36,"Meta Description:

Introduction:

Imagine a world where windows not only bring in natural light but also help maintain a comfortable temperature, reducing the need for excessive air conditioning and contributing to significant energy savings. Thanks to a team of researchers at the University of Notre Dame, this vision is becoming a reality. They have developed an innovative window coating that blocks heat-generating ultraviolet and infrared light while allowing visible light to pass through, regardless of the sun's angle.

The Breakthrough Coating:

Traditional window coatings are designed to work optimally when light enters a room at a 90-degree angle. However, at noon—often the hottest time of the day—the sun's rays enter vertically installed windows at oblique angles. To address this issue, the researchers created a transparent window coating by stacking ultra-thin layers of silica, alumina, and titanium oxide on a glass base. A micrometer-thick silicon polymer was added to enhance the structure's cooling power by reflecting thermal radiation through the atmospheric window and into outer space.

Optimizing the Coating with Quantum Computing:

To ensure the coating would accommodate multiple angles of solar light, the team turned to quantum computing and quantum annealing. By using this technology, they were able to shuffle the layers into an optimal configuration, maximizing visible light transmission while minimizing the passage of heat-producing wavelengths. This approach resulted in a coating that maintained transparency and reduced temperature by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees Celsius (about 9.7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in a model room, even when light was transmitted in a broad range of angles.

Applications and Future Prospects:

The revolutionary coating can be incorporated onto existing windows or automobiles, offering the potential for substantial energy savings. In hot climates, the coating can reduce air-conditioning cooling costs by more than one-third. Moreover, the active learning and quantum computing scheme developed for this project can be applied to design a wide range of materials with complex properties, paving the way for future breakthroughs in materials science and engineering.

Introduction

In the quest for sustainable energy solutions, researchers are constantly exploring innovative methods to harness untapped energy sources, such as vibrations generated by passing cars or trains. A recent study published in Advanced Science has unveiled a revolutionary approach to energy harvesting using reconfigurable elastic metasurfaces, which can be assembled much like LEGO bricks. This multifunctional metasurface, inspired by the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory, demonstrates outstanding effectiveness in harvesting elastic wave energy, enhancing the electrical output power of piezoelectric components by up to eight times. This technology, with its applications in structural health monitoring, wireless sensing, and the Internet of Things, holds great potential for significant contributions across diverse fields.

Understanding Elastic Metamaterials

Metamaterials are artificially designed structures that manipulate wave energy, such as light, vibration, and sound. In the context of energy harvesting, elastic metamaterials can gather elastic waves in piezoelectric components, increasing the efficiency of electricity production. However, limitations in theoretical analysis confine their operation to a single frequency, restricting their utility to specific purposes.

To overcome these limitations, a collaborative research team led by Professor Junsuk Rho from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and Professor Miso Kim from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) applied the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory instead of the conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. This theory considers the fundamental characteristics of elasticity, including shear deformation and rotational inertia effects of the beam, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of elastic metamaterials.

Interpreting and Modeling Elastic Metamaterials

The research team successfully interpreted and modeled elastic metamaterials for phase modulation of elastic waves using the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory. They fabricated a new type of Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam-based reconfigurable elastic metasurface (TREM) capable of attaching and detaching multiple structures.

Introduction

The realm of quantum computing has long been a fascinating frontier, with the potential to revolutionize the way we handle complex calculations. Quantum computers, harnessing the power of qubits instead of classical bits, could solve problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. However, the challenge lies in the high error rates of qubits, which has limited the practical applications of current quantum computers. This is where Microsoft and Quantinuum make their groundbreaking entrance.

A New Era of Quantum Computing

IBM, Google, and others have showcased quantum computing hardware, but their systems have yet to be utilized for practical purposes. Microsoft's latest announcement, in collaboration with Quantinuum, promises a significant leap in error-free quantum computing. By combining Microsoft's error-correcting technology with Quantinuum's hardware, they have achieved an 800 times lower error rate compared to using physical qubits alone.

Virtual Qubits: The Key to Error Reduction

Microsoft's approach involves grouping physical qubits into virtual qubits. This technique allows for error diagnostics and correction without destroying the qubits, enhancing their resilience. By maintaining more than 14,000 experiments without encountering errors, Microsoft has brought quantum computing one step closer to real-world applications.

The Path to Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing

Jason Zander, EVP of Microsoft's Strategic Missions and Technologies division, believes this achievement brings us closer to Level 2 Resilient quantum computing. The ultimate goal is to create reliable logical qubits, which can protect against noise and sustain long computations. Microsoft's progress is an important step towards unlocking solutions to complex challenges, such as climate change and exotic drug research, using Level 3 quantum supercomputing.

Expert Opinions

Aram Harrow, a professor of physics at MIT, praised Microsoft's achievement, citing the impressive error rates and control demonstrated by the Quantinuum system.

Introduction

Apple has long been promoting its devices as champions of user privacy, with the slogan ""Privacy. That's iPhone"" adorning its advertisements. However, a new study from Aalto University challenges this notion, revealing that Apple's default apps, which come pre-installed on new devices, may not be as private as users think. This article will discuss the findings of the study, focusing on the lack of transparency in privacy settings and the challenges users face when attempting to restrict data sharing.

The Study: Privacy Settings of Apple's Default Apps

Aalto University researchers investigated the privacy settings of eight default Apple apps, including Safari, Siri, Family Sharing, iMessage, FaceTime, Location Services, Find My, and Touch ID. The research team collected all publicly available privacy-related information on these apps, analyzing technical documentation, privacy policies, and user manuals.

Surprising Findings

One of the most surprising findings was the fragility of privacy protections within these apps. Users are often unaware of the data collection taking place in the background, even when they have chosen not to enable certain features like Siri's voice control. The user interface design often fails to provide a clear understanding of the privacy implications of enabling or disabling various settings.

Participants in the study found it nearly impossible to stop data sharing in any of the apps, despite following complex and confusing instructions provided by Apple. The researchers discovered that users were unable to fully protect their privacy, as they could only take one or two steps in the right direction before getting lost in the process.

Implications for Users

The findings indicate that protecting privacy on Apple devices requires a deep understanding of each app's settings and a significant investment of time. Unfortunately, Apple's help resources are not user-friendly, and the necessary steps to restrict data sharing are scattered across various locations in the settings.

Moreover, users may be unaware of how their data is being used by Apple, as the company's public documents do not provide a clear explanation. While some data may be used to train artificial intelligence systems or provide personalized user experiences, the lack of transparency raises concerns about potential misuse of user information.

DCVC, a deep tech venture capital firm founded by Matt Ocko and Zachary Bogue, launched its first climate-focused fund, Climate Select, in December 2022 with a target of $500 million. However, the fund's target has been adjusted multiple times, and the firm has only raised $157 million of commitments by December 2023, according to SEC filings. Recently, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the fund may be heading towards a $400 million target.

Climate Select is aimed at mid-stage climate startups, where the firm believes there is a current funding gap in the climate startup ecosystem. While this is the first dedicated climate tech fund for the firm, DCVC has invested $360 million from other funds into climate startups over the last decade. The firm has also recently secured a $50 million commitment from the New Mexico State Investment Council, according to a recent New Mexico Inno article.

DCVC's climate-focused fund has faced several challenges, including the tough fundraising market conditions of the last few years and the slow-paced adoption of new strategies from established managers. Despite these challenges, the firm remains committed to its investment in climate technologies, which it sees as one of the major opportunities for the fund, alongside tech bio and robotics.

The success of DCVC's Climate Select Fund is closely tied to its existing portfolio companies, which have been experiencing some wins in recent years. One such example is Twelve, a company that creates products traditionally made using fossil fuels from carbon. Twelve recently secured a 14-year purchase agreement with the International Airlines Group, which includes airlines like Aer Lingus and British Airways, to buy 260 million gallons of Twelve's more sustainable aviation fuel.

DCVC's decision to adjust its fundraising target is not surprising, given the challenging fundraising environment of the last few years. Fundraising for venture firms across the board has been incredibly tough in 2022 and 2023, with U.S.-based firms raising $66.9 billion in 2023, the lowest total since 2017 and a 61% decrease from the record-setting year prior. Despite these challenges, climate investing remains one of the few hot spots for VC attention and fundraising, with climate-focused funds raising more than $710 million so far in 2024, according to data from Preqin.

In conclusion, DCVC's Climate Select Fund is a case study in navigating the rollercoaster of venture fundraising in the current market. While the fund has faced several challenges, including a lower target and slow-paced adoption of new strategies, the firm remains committed to investing in climate technologies. The success of the fund is closely tied to its existing portfolio companies and the growing interest in climate investing among VC firms.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1186549350.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-03 21:45:12,DCVC's Climate Select Fund: Overcoming Challenges in the Venture Fundraising Market | Boost Your Investment Potential with Our Expert Guidance | Invest in Climate Startups with Confidence | Take Action Now and Secure Your Share of the Growing Climate Investing Market | Optimize Your Venture Fundraising with DCVC's Climate Select Fund | Join Our Network of Climate Investors and Stay Ahead of the Competition | Discover the Best Climate Startups with DCVC's Climate Select Fund | Navigating the Challenges of Climate Investing: A Guide from DCVC | Unlock the Opportunities of Climate Technology with DCVC's Climate Select Fund | Diversify Your Portfolio with DCVC's Climate Select Fund: Invest in the Future of Sustainability Today,DCVC Climate Select Fund,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-ai-key-roles-scientific.html,"AI can take over key management roles in scientific research, shows study",AI in scientific research: study shows AI can manage human participants effectively.,"

If you're a researcher looking to improve the efficiency and scalability of your scientific projects, you might want to consider incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into your management strategy. A recent study by Maximilian Koehler and Henry Sauermann from ESMT Berlin shows that AI can effectively manage human participants in large-scale research projects, taking over functions such as task allocation, coordination, and motivation.

In this article, we'll explore the role of AI in scientific research and how it can enhance the management of complex, large-scale projects. We'll discuss how algorithmic management (AM) can enable projects to operate at a larger scale and efficiency, and we'll examine the various managerial functions that AI can perform effectively.

Algorithmic management (AM) suggests a significant shift in the way research projects are conducted, allowing researchers to take advantage of AI's instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities. In this approach, AI is not used as a ""worker"" performing specific research tasks such as data collection and analysis, but as a ""manager"" of human workers performing such tasks.

Koehler and Sauermann investigated the use of AM in crowd and citizen science projects and found that AI can effectively perform five important managerial functions: task division and allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning.

To conduct their research, the authors reviewed online documents, interviewed organizers, AI developers, and project participants, and joined some projects as participants. This allowed them to identify projects that use algorithmic management and to understand how AI performs management functions.

The study revealed that AM-enabled projects are often larger than projects that do not use AM and are associated with platforms that provide access to shared AI tools. This suggests that AM may enable projects to scale but also requires technical infrastructures that stand-alone projects may find difficult to develop.

As AI becomes increasingly capable of managing complex, large-scale projects, it could be a critical factor in improving research productivity. ""The capabilities of artificial intelligence have reached a point where AI can now significantly enhance the scope and efficiency of scientific research by managing complex, large-scale projects,"" states Koehler.

However, it's important to note that AI is not a replacement for human managers. As Henry Sauermann, professor of strategy at ESMT, notes, ""If AI can take over some of the more algorithmic and mundane functions of management, human leaders could shift their attention to more strategic and social tasks such as identifying high-value research targets, raising funding, or building an effective organizational culture.""

In conclusion, algorithmic management (AM) has the potential to revolutionize the way scientific research is conducted, enabling projects to operate at a larger scale and efficiency. While AI can take over important management functions, it's important to remember that human managers still play a crucial role in scientific research, particularly in strategic and social tasks. As AI continues to evolve and become more capable, it will be exciting to see how it shapes the future of scientific research.

Ghost Autonomy, which employed around 100 people and had bases in Mountain View, Dallas, and Sydney, was forced to shut down due to the uncertain path to long-term profitability. The current funding climate and the significant investment required for autonomy development and commercialization contributed to the company's decision to wind down its operations.

The startup had recently partnered with OpenAI through the OpenAI Startup Fund, gaining early access to OpenAI systems and Azure resources from Microsoft. Ghost also received a $5 million investment from OpenAI, indicating a promising collaboration. However, these efforts were not enough to sustain the company's operations in the long run.

A Shift in Focus and Approach

Ghost Autonomy, originally called Ghost Locomotion, was founded in 2017 with a plan to develop a kit allowing privately owned passenger vehicles to drive autonomously on highways. The company aimed to deliver this technology in 2020. However, as deadlines passed and funding challenges emerged, the startup shifted its focus to crash prevention technology.

In 2021, Ghost Autonomy raised another $100 million in a Series D funding round led by Sutter Hill Ventures, with the inclusion of Founders Fund and Coatue. The company abandoned its consumer kit model and turned its attention to universal collision avoidance technology to expedite its entry into the market.

Skepticism and Challenges

Ghost Autonomy's co-founder and CEO, John Hayes, had previously expressed the company's plans to explore the applications of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in self-driving. However, experts remained skeptical of this approach, arguing that LLMs might not offer the best solution for understanding complex scenes in autonomous driving.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/63601ea88ad98c2b9489d284_Ghost-autonomy-01-1.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-03 21:17:52,"Meta Description:

Introduction

Ocean waves pack a powerful punch, and researchers are keen on harnessing this energy via 'blue energy.' A recent breakthrough, reported in ACS Energy Letters, details a simple repositioning of an electrode in a wave-energy device, leading to a significant increase in energy extraction.

Device: Liquid-Solid Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs)

These tube-shaped wave-energy harvesters, known as liquid-solid TENGs, convert mechanical energy into electricity using friction between water and the tube's inner surface. Low energy output has limited their widespread use and practicality for large-scale applications.

Optimization: Repositioning the Electrode

By placing the energy-collecting electrode at the end of the tube instead of the center, researchers observed a 2.4 times higher conversion of mechanical energy into electrical current. This simple repositioning offers a promising approach to enhance blue energy harvesting.","Title: Harnessing the Power of Ocean Waves: A New Approach to Blue Energy Harvesting

Introduction

We've all witnessed the raw and awe-inspiring force of ocean waves. But have you ever pondered the idea of harnessing this natural energy for practical purposes? Interestingly, researchers are actively exploring the potential of wave energy to generate electricity, coining it 'blue energy.' Recently, a significant breakthrough has been made in this field, as reported in ACS Energy Letters. By simply repositioning the electrode within a wave-energy harvesting device, scientists have managed to dramatically increase the amount of energy extracted from the ocean's ebb and flow.

The Blue Energy Harvesting Device: Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs)

The tube-shaped wave-energy harvesting device at the heart of this innovation is called a liquid–solid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). TENGs convert mechanical energy into electricity by utilizing the friction generated when water sloshes back and forth against the inside of the tube. However, one major challenge with TENGs is their low energy output, which has hindered their widespread use and practicality for large-scale applications.

Optimizing Energy Harvesting: Repositioning the Electrode

To address the low energy output issue, a team of researchers led by Guozhang Dai, Kai Yin, and Junliang Yan focused on optimizing the location of the energy-collecting electrode within the liquid–solid TENG. They created two TENGs using 16-inch clear plastic tubes and filled them with water, leaving some space at the top.

In the first TENG, the researchers placed the copper foil electrode at the center of the tube, which is the conventional setup. However, in the second device, they inserted the electrode at one end of the tube.

Comparing the Performance: Conventional vs. Optimized Design

When both devices were placed on a benchtop and the rocker moved water back and forth, the team observed an interesting result. The optimized design, with the electrode at the end of the tube, demonstrated a remarkable 2.4 times higher conversion of mechanical energy into electrical current compared to the conventional design.

Opera, the renowned web browser, has recently announced a new feature that allows users to access LLMs entirely locally on their devices. This marks the first time that a major browser has provided users with the ability to download LLMs for local use through a built-in feature.

According to Opera, the LLMs feature is now available in the developer stream of Opera One as a part of the company's AI Feature Drops Program, which enables early adopters to test experimental AI features. This means that Opera users can now take advantage of LLMs without sending any data to a server.

The available LLMs include Google's Gemma, Mistral AI's Mixtral, Meta's Llama, and Vicuna. In total, there are approximately 50 families and 150 LLMs available for users to download. It's worth noting that each LLM requires a significant amount of storage - between 2GB to 10GB, depending on the complexity of the model.

Opera recommends users to try out a few models before making a decision. Some of the recommended LLMs include Code Llama, an extension of Llama aimed at generating and discussing code, Mixtral, a natural language processing model designed for a wide range of tasks like text generation and question answering, and Microsoft Research's Phi-2, a language model that demonstrates ""outstanding reasoning and language understanding capabilities.""

To test this feature, users need to upgrade to the latest version of Opera Developer. Once they have done that, they can open the Aria Chat side panel and select ""choose local mode"" from the dropdown box at the top. From there, they can click ""Go to settings"" and search for the models they want to download. When the LLM they choose is downloaded, they can click the menu button on the top left to start a new chat. They can then choose the model they just downloaded and start chatting.

It's important to note that the LLM users choose will replace Opera's native AI until they switch back to Aria. This new feature will provide Opera users with greater flexibility and control over their browsing experience.
