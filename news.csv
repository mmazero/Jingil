Introduction

Imagine a world where humans can accomplish a wide range of manual tasks remotely, including risky and complex procedures. This is no longer a futuristic dream, but a rapidly approaching reality, thanks to the effective operation of robots from a distance, also known as teleoperation. Teleoperation can not only enable humans to complete tasks from afar but also aid in collecting human motion data to train humanoid robots on new tasks. A recent breakthrough by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University brings us one step closer to this future.

The Human2HumanOid (H 2 O) Method

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed an innovative method called Human2HumanOid (H 2 O) that allows for the effective teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots. This approach, introduced in a paper posted to the arXiv preprint server, could revolutionize the training of humanoid robots on manual tasks requiring specific sets of movements, such as playing various sports, pushing a trolley or stroller, and moving boxes.

H 2 O: A Scalable and Efficient Solution

H 2 O is a scalable and efficient method that enables researchers to compile large datasets of human motions and retarget these motions to humanoid robots. This allows humans to teleoperate them in real-time, reproducing all their body movements on the robot. Achieving full-body teleoperation of robots in real-time is a challenging task, as the bodies of humanoid robots do not always allow them to replicate human motions involving different limbs. Existing model-based controllers do not always produce realistic movements in robots.

H 2 O Teleoperation: A Reinforcement Learning Framework

H 2 O teleoperation is a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the real-time whole-body teleoperation of humanoid robots using just an RGB camera. The process begins by retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities through a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints.

Meta, the social networking giant, has announced updates to its rules concerning AI-generated content and manipulated media. These changes come after facing criticism from Meta's Oversight Board. Starting next month, Meta will label a wider range of such content, including the application of a ""Made with AI"" badge to deepfakes. Additional contextual information will be provided when content has been manipulated in ways that could potentially deceive the public on critical issues.

The new policy could result in more content that has the potential to be misleading receiving labels, which is crucial in a year with many elections taking place worldwide. However, for deepfakes, Meta will only apply labels if the content in question has ""industry standard AI image indicators"" or if the uploader has disclosed it's AI-generated content. Content that falls outside these bounds will likely remain unlabeled.

Meta is shifting its focus towards providing transparency and additional context as a better approach to handling AI-generated or manipulated media on its platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. The new policy seems to indicate that more labels and fewer takedowns will be the course of action for such content on Meta's platforms.

The change in approach may be a response to increasing legal demands on Meta regarding content moderation and systemic risk, such as the European Union's Digital Services Act. The EU has applied a set of rules to its main social networks, requiring Meta to balance purging illegal content, mitigating systemic risks, and protecting free speech. The bloc is also exerting additional pressure on platforms ahead of elections to the European Parliament this June, including urging tech giants to watermark deepfakes where technically feasible.

Meta's Oversight Board, which the tech giant funds but operates independently, reviews a small percentage of content moderation decisions and makes policy recommendations. Meta is not obligated to accept the Board's suggestions but has agreed to amend its approach in this instance. In response to the Board's feedback, Meta is modifying its policies on AI-generated content and manipulated media.

Back in February, the Oversight Board recommended that Meta reevaluate its approach to AI-generated content after reviewing a doctored video of President Biden.

Social media titan Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has unveiled plans to modify its rules surrounding AI-generated content and manipulated media. The move follows criticism from Meta's Oversight Board, which called for a more nuanced approach in handling such content. Starting next month, Meta will broaden the scope of labeled content, including AI-generated deepfakes adorned with a ""Made with AI"" badge.

The updated policy will likely result in more content receiving labels, offering increased transparency for users and minimizing the potential for public deception. However, Meta will only label deepfakes that meet certain criteria, such as the presence of ""industry standard AI image indicators"" or explicit disclosures from content creators.

Meta's shift in focus, prioritizing transparency and context provision, marks a significant change in managing AI-generated or manipulated media on its platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. The new strategy suggests that Meta will favor labels and moderation over outright content removal.

The adjustment could be a response to increasing legal demands regarding content moderation and systemic risks, such as the European Union's Digital Services Act. The EU has applied pressure on Meta to maintain a delicate balance between eliminating illegal content, mitigating systemic risks, and safeguarding free speech.

Meta's Oversight Board, an independent entity funded by Meta, periodically reviews a selection of content moderation decisions and offers policy recommendations. Although Meta is not obligated to follow the Board's advice, it has agreed to revise its policies on AI-generated content and manipulated media based on the Board's feedback.

Introduction

In a recent turn of events, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has announced that a ""Tesla Robotaxi"" will be unveiled on August 8. This announcement comes after Musk denied reports by Reuters that Tesla was abandoning its plans for a low-cost electric vehicle (EV) to focus on a robotaxi. This revelation has sparked curiosity and excitement among industry enthusiasts and consumers alike, as Tesla continues to push the boundaries of automotive technology.

The Search for a New Product

Tesla's EV sales have experienced a lull, leading to a decline in profits. In search of a solution, the company has been exploring alternative products to boost sales or, at the very least, the stock price. The robotaxi project, built on the same platform as the low-cost EV, is Tesla's latest endeavor to regain momentum.

The Robotaxi Concept

The idea of a robotaxi has been in development for years. Musk has faced internal disagreements between engineers advocating for a traditional car with a steering wheel and pedals and those pushing for a vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals. Despite these challenges, Tesla has continued to develop autonomous capabilities for its vehicles, with the goal of creating a truly self-driving car.

Tesla's Autonomous Capabilities

Tesla vehicles are equipped with a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, which comes standard with all new models. For an additional cost, owners can purchase ""full self-driving"" or FSD, a feature that Musk has promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. However, it is essential to note that Tesla vehicles are not yet self-driving, and the FSD feature still requires driver supervision at all times.

Features of FSD

FSD includes several automated driving features, such as Summon, an automated parking feature, and Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and lane changes. The system is also designed to handle steering on city streets.

In response to recent concerns about the impact of Snapchat's ""Solar System"" feature on teenagers' mental health, the social media giant has decided to make some adjustments. This article will delve into the changes Snapchat has implemented and the potential implications for its users.

The Solar System feature, which ranks a user's Snapchat friends based on their engagement levels, has been the subject of criticism for exacerbating anxiety and self-doubt among teenagers. According to The Wall Street Journal, some users have experienced hurt feelings and even relationships strained by the feature's hierarchy.

Snapchat acknowledges the feedback and has announced that it will turn off the Solar System feature by default for Snapchat+ subscribers. While users can still enable it if they wish, this move aims to prevent users who do not want to participate from feeling uncomfortable.

By making this change, Snapchat appears to be taking steps to address concerns about its features contributing to negative user experiences. However, it's worth noting that turning off the feature by default might not entirely resolve the issue. Teenagers eager to engage with the Solar System feature will likely search for the setting to turn it back on.

Snapchat's defense of the feature revolves around the idea that users want more insight into their friendships and that the Solar System provides additional context and awareness. However, critics argue that these features primarily serve to keep young people engaged with the app, potentially fostering addiction and psychological harm.

The Solar System feature is only one of several friend-ranking systems Snapchat offers. The platform's ""Best Friends"" feature, for example, highlights the most frequently contacted individuals with special emojis. Another contentious feature, ""Streaks,"" encourages repeated app usage by displaying how many consecutive days users have remained in touch.

Despite promising to mitigate the potential downsides of online communication, Snapchat has faced lawsuits and Congressional inquiries due to the addictive nature and psychological consequences of its features. The company's decision to modify the Solar System feature may indicate a growing awareness of these concerns and a commitment to creating a more positive user experience.

A revolutionary 'green bank' has been established in the US, aiming to channel over $160 billion in capital into climate technology. This initiative targets smaller-scale projects that have been overlooked by banks due to their lower profitability. These projects include residential heat pump installations and affordable housing renovations.

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, as it is officially known, was announced by the EPA on Thursday. It has allocated $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations. These organizations will utilize the funds to provide loans for climate-focused projects, with a particular emphasis on underserved communities.

Dawn Lippert, CEO of Elemental Excelerator, expressed her enthusiasm to TechCrunch, stating, ""It's a chance to prove that this works and creates real benefit on the ground for people across America... tribal communities, rural communities, low income and disadvantaged communities are really the focus here."" Indeed, over $14 billion of the funding will be directed towards these communities.

The loan format of the funding allows for recycling once loans are repaid, and green bank loans have demonstrated a low delinquency rate. The Connecticut Green Bank, for instance, has a delinquency rate comparable to other commercial lenders across both residential and commercial portfolios.

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund aims to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar disbursed. However, this could potentially be a conservative estimate. McKinsey predicts that the new green bank could draw more than $12 of private investment per dollar on its balance sheet.

The US is projected to require $27 trillion by 2050 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. While the green bank's $20 billion may seem modest in comparison, its capacity to stimulate private investment and its role as a recurring fund, rather than a one-time grant, will enable it to make a significant impact beyond its initial outlay.
