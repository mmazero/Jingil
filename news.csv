Introduction:
Facebook's sibling company, Instagram, introduced Threads in 2021 to attract users seeking alternatives after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. However, Meta has faced persistent criticisms regarding its mandatory creation of an Instagram account to use Threads. Recently, the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA) took action against Meta's data-sharing practices between Threads and Instagram, leading to the temporary shutdown of Threads in Turkey starting from April 29. This decision follows a series of regulatory disputes Meta has encountered throughout Europe.

Regulatory Battles in Europe:
Last year, Meta was fined €235 million ($267 million) due to WhatsApp GDPR violations in the EU. Additionally, Meta was compelled to sell Giphy, which it acquired for $400 million, to Shutterstock for $53 million because the merger diminished competition. Furthermore, in 2022, Turkey penalized Meta with a TRY 190 million ($18.6 million) fine for consolidating user information across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Following the initial fine, Turkey threatened to impose an extra daily penalty of TRY 1.5 million ($160,000) for failing to comply with the earlier ruling.

Data Meshing Investigation:
The TCA initiated an investigation into how Meta links Threads with Instagram in December, announcing its preliminary findings in February. According to the TCA, Meta's extensive data collection provides significant value to advertisers, making it challenging for competitors to secure advertising revenue. Moreover, Meta operates like an ecosystem where data advantages gained through one platform are transferred to others, enhancing overall market dominance. As a result, the TCA concluded that Meta created barriers to entry in the market.

Consequences for Users:
As of April 29, Threads will cease operations in Turkey while Meta continues negotiations and seeks legal solutions. Affected users have received notifications allowing them to choose between deleting or deactivating their profiles before the deadline. Deactivation gives users the option to restore their profiles once Threads becomes accessible again in Turkey; however, deleted accounts cannot be recovered.

Meta's Response:
Despite Meta's disagreement with the TCA's interim order, the company acknowledged receiving the notice and intends to appeal the decision. Meanwhile, Meta stated that ""the TCA's interim order leaves us with no choice but to temporarily shut down Threads in Türkiye."" Nevertheless, Meta expressed interest in working cooperatively with the TCA to resolve the issue swiftly and reinstate Threads in Turkey soon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1978497338-e1713180431349.jpg?resize=1200,676",2024-04-15 12:18:45,"""Discover why Meta's Threads app halted in Turkey: Data-sharing concerns.

In a recent development, social networking service Bluesky has started allowing heads of state to sign up and join their platform. This move comes at a pivotal time, as major general elections are scheduled in countries like the U.S. and India this year.

Bluesky's Discreet Invitation-only Phase

During Bluesky's invite-only phase, which lasted for almost a year, the company had refrained from allowing heads of state to sign up. They had urged users to reach out to the startup directly before extending invitations to any prominent figures. At that time, Bluesky stated:

""We are grateful for everyone's excitement in sending out invitations, but our current policy does not allow us to accommodate heads of state to join us in our beta stage. This applies to both current and recent heads of state.""

Bluesky's Open Sign-up and Moderation Improvements

However, in February, Bluesky opened its doors to the public. This change occurred after the platform had faced moderation challenges early in its life, which included preventing users from using racial slurs in their handles and tackling hate speech.

To address these issues, Bluesky has taken significant steps to improve its moderation system. These improvements include moderation lists and automated moderation tools, which were introduced in December 2023. Furthermore, the platform announced Ozone last month, a tool that enables users to create their own custom moderation and labeling services.

Threads' Political Content Approach Contrasted with Bluesky's

While Bluesky's rival, Threads, has chosen to distance itself from actively promoting political content, Bluesky users have the freedom to subscribe to various feeds, bypassing the need for a central algorithm to see content.

In conclusion, Bluesky's new policy of welcoming heads of state sign-ups is a significant milestone in the world of social media and politics. As general elections approach in various countries, this platform could potentially reshape how political figures engage with their constituents and the public on social media.

Introduction:

When massive layoffs hit the tech industry in 2022 and 2023, public concern primarily focused on the affected employees. However, little attention was given to another group impacted by these workforce reductions – the recruiters. Recognizing the value of these displaced professionals, Paraform, a recruitment platform targeting startups, decided to seize the opportunity. By connecting startups with talented, independent recruiters, Paraform aims to broaden the reach of businesses looking to source top talent. Recently, Paraform secured a $3.6 million seed round led by A—a venture capital firm established by Kevin Hartz, the co-founder of Eventbrite and Xoom, as well as Airbnb's initial investor. Let's dive deeper into how Paraform plans to revolutionize the world of recruitment.

A Unique Opportunity Arises from Massive Layoffs:

According to John Kim, Paraform's CEO, during the peak of tech layoffs between 2022 and 2023, approximately 100,000 recruiters lost their jobs. This surge resulted in numerous former recruiters establishing their own ventures. These individuals bring along highly sought-after skills and connections, making them attractive partners for startups eager to tap into fresh talent streams. Currently, Paraform hosts thousands of recruiters on its platform and boasts support provided to over 200 companies in fulfilling various job vacancies.

Revenue Model & Customer Base Expansion:

Paraform operates via a subscription model; charging clients a listing fee to display job opportunities while collecting a success fee upon successful hires. According to Kim, ""this strategy encourages commitment from startups toward both the two-sided marketplace and the recruiters."" Apart from serving early- and late-stage startups, Paraform collaborates with large, in-house talent acquisition departments to address difficult-to-fill positions. More than half of Paraform's clientele maintains internal staff yet continues utilizing the platform. In doing so, they can engage with external recruiter networks without committing to permanent hires while maintaining flexible scaling options based on varying hiring requirements.

Recent Funding Successes & Future Plans:

Having closed a $5 million investment round, Paraform doubled its previous capital raising efforts and attracted prominent figures such as DoorDash co-founder Evan Moore and executives representing Affirm, Hightouch, Palantir, and Ramp. Additionally, earlier supporter Primer Sazze Partners returned for further backing. With this financial boost, Paraform seeks expansion throughout the United States, onboarding more engineers and operational personnel to manage increasing customer needs. Furthermore, international growth remains on the horizon, as demonstrated through recent partnerships formed in Europe, South Korea, and Australia.

Revolutionary Enterprise Solutions & Role Diversification:

Introduction
------------

In today's world, where artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role, data has become the lifeblood of technological advancement. However, individuals whose data fuels these innovations often don't receive any compensation. Enter Vana, a groundbreaking startup aiming to revolutionize the way people perceive and benefit from their data. Co-founded by Anna Kazlauskas and Art Abal, Vana empowers users to take charge of their information and even lease it out to train AI models—a concept that could forever alter the relationship between data ownership and value creation.

Building Infrastructure for User-Owned Data Treasury
----------------------------------------------------

Before founding Vana, Kazlauskas delved into computer science and economics at MIT, subsequently establishing a successful fintech automation startup named Iambiq. Meanwhile, Abal pursued law and served as an associate at The Cadmus Group and later headed impact sourcing at Appen, a data annotation company. Leveraging their diverse backgrounds, they created Vana to enable users to ""pool"" their data, forming valuable datasets for generative AI model training. This approach results in customized experiences such as tailored wellness messages or artistic creations reflective of individual styles. By doing so, Vana fosters a sense of ownership among users and grants them greater control over their data.

 How Does It Work?

Through Vana's API, developers can seamlessly integrate a user's cross-platform personal data into their applications, creating highly personalized experiences without worrying about compute costs. Users, in turn, can effortlessly transport their personal data from popular platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google to participating applications. Moreover, Vana ensures enhanced security through optional self-hosting features, enabling users to maintain complete custody of their data if desired.

A Profitable Solution Disincentivizing Exploitation
--------------------------------------------------

By charging users a nominal monthly subscription fee ($3.99) and imposing a ""data transaction"" fee on developers utilizing dataset transfers for AI model training, Vana effectively aligns its financial incentives away from exploiting users and their rich cache of personal information. As stated by Kazlauskas, Vana envisions cultivating communities of users collaboratively contributing their data and AI models, thereby democratizing access to powerful technologies while ensuring fair compensation for participants.

Introducing the Reddit Data Digital Autonomous Organization (DAO)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of this mission, Vana recently rolled out the Reddit Data DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This initiative combines the Reddit data of numerous users—incorporating elements such as karma and posting histories—allowing them to collectively govern its utilization. Once registered with a Reddit account and after obtaining their data via Reddit, users obtain voting rights alongside fellow community members regarding matters like licensing the consolidated data to generative AI corporations for mutual profits. With over 141,000 Reddit users having joined during phase one alone, the Reddit Data DAO already ranks as the most extensive data DAO ever established.

Conclusion
----------

Vana represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of data ownership and value generation. Through innovative solutions like the Reddit Data DAO, Vana champions user empowerment and equitable distribution of benefits derived from personal information. Ultimately, Vana strives to reshape the landscape of AI development and foster a more inclusive, transparent, and remunerative ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/reddit-ipo-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-13 16:15:41,"""Empower your data ownership!

In today's interconnected world, companies are constantly on the lookout for innovative ways to find the best talents in the most efficient manner. Draftboard, co-founded by Zach Roseman, offers a unique solution to this challenge by opening up referral bonus programs to people outside the organization. This platform allows employers to tap into their networks to discover top-notch candidates, making the hiring process faster and more precise.

Traditionally, companies offering role referral bonuses assume that their employees hold a deep understanding of the company culture and job requirements. Draftboard, however, seeks to expand this concept by enabling external referrers to join the search for talent. As Roseman mentioned in his interview with TechCrunch, ""why not leverage existing referral bonus programs and the power of a networked world to identify the best candidates?"" By doing so, companies benefit from a smaller yet highly qualified pool of applicants, streamlining the recruitment process.

So, how does Draftboard operate? The platform is free for companies and boasts a network of approximately 1,000 referrers, or ""scouts,"" as Draftboard calls them. These scouts are notified as referrals progress through various stages of the recruitment process. Scouts are then graded based on the quality of their referrals, with Draftboard taking a 20% cut of each referral bonus.

How did Draftboard assemble its initial group of referrers? Cold calling and networking were the primary strategies. Roseman and his team reached out to individuals running and managing tech communities via WhatsApp groups, listservs, LinkedIn, and other platforms. By understanding their pain points, Draftboard built a valuable network of scouts.

One might wonder if there are requirements to become a referrer. Surprisingly, there are minimal restrictions, which may initially seem risky for companies. Roseman, however, argues that this approach democratizes the process in a meritocratic way. Companies set their minimum scores, and scouts with lower scores are not allowed to send referrals to them. This self-reinforcing system empowers referrers to regulate their behavior and maintain a high-quality pool of candidates.

The ever-evolving digital age has transformed every aspect of life, including the hiring landscape. Draftboard, pioneered by Zach Roseman, introduces a groundbreaking strategy to sourcing exceptional talent efficiently—by extending access to referral bonus programs beyond organizational boundaries. In essence, Draftboard taps into a broader network to pinpoint premier candidates while expediting and refining the selection process.

Historically, businesses relied on internal personnel to recommend potential hires due to their familiarity with corporate values and position specifications. However, Draftboard amplifies this model by incorporating external participants who can further enrich the candidate search. Consequently, organizations enjoy reduced application volumes comprised solely of well-qualified contenders, ultimately accelerating recruitment efforts.

Functionally, Draftboard operates without charging clients any fees; instead, it fosters connections with around 1,000 advocates known as 'scouts.' Upon joining Draftboard, these individuals receive alerts regarding referred prospects navigating various phases of employment evaluations. To ensure optimal performance, scouts earn grades reflective of their recommendations' caliber. Notably, Draftboard retains a 20% commission per successful introduction.

To amass its preliminary assortment of scouts, Draftboard utilized direct marketing techniques coupled with strategic networking. Engaging contacts responsible for administering technology collectives became crucial during this phase. Leveraging communication channels such as WhatsApp, email threads, LinkedIn, and similar platforms, Draftboard identified shared concerns and cultivated a robust network of ambassadors.

A common question emerges concerning prerequisites for becoming part of Draftboard's scouting community. Remarkably, entry barriers remain relatively low, potentially raising apprehensions among corporations. Nevertheless, Roseman counters skepticism by asserting that this policy democratizes participation under a meritocracy framework. Businesses establish baseline ratings, allowing only higher-performing scouts to submit suggestions. Ultimately, this incentivized arrangement motivates scouts to preserve a superior standard of submissions.

Welcome back to this week’s edition of the Mobility newsletter, where we dive into the ever-evolving world of transportation, from electric vehicles (EVs) to autonomous driving technologies. Let’s explore the latest developments that have caught our attention.

Cruise robotaxis resurface, but with a twist

Cruise, General Motors’ self-driving car subsidiary, has recently announced its return to the mobility scene, but not as we might have expected. The company is redeploying its robotaxis, but this time in Phoenix, with all vehicles driven manually by employees. This move is surprising, given that Cruise has had a presence in Phoenix since at least 2020 and has already mapped its roads in the area.

Moreover, Cruise has petitioned California regulators to reinstate its permits to operate in San Francisco, raising questions about whether the company will remap its hometown or jump back into robotaxi services. Meanwhile, Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous driving unit, has officially launched paid rides in Los Angeles, initially operating on a small scale.

BlueCruise scrutinized after fatal crash

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the driver of a Ford Mustang Mach-E, utilizing the BlueCruise hands-free driver-assistance system, was involved in a fatal crash in Texas in February. This incident marks the first known fatality associated with the use of BlueCruise.

The NTSB announced its investigation of a second fatal crash near Philadelphia, where Ford’s driver-assistance system might have been active. This revelation comes just after the safety board reported that the driver of a Tesla involved in a fatal crash in Texas in April was not in the driver’s seat at the time of the accident, raising concerns about the safety and reliability of semi-autonomous driving systems.

EV companies attract investments and partnerships

In the EV space, numerous startups have recently secured investments and partnerships to bolster their operations and reach:

In a significant shakeup, Tesla has recently undergone changes in its executive leadership while implementing cost-cutting measures and adjusting product strategies. Two high-profile executives, Drew Baglino, SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development, have left the company. Their departures come as Tesla lays off thousands of employees to boost productivity and streamline operations.

TechCrunch confirmed the executives' departures, with Patel stating that the decision was due to ""big overall changes"" at the company. Baglino, who spent 18 years at Tesla, expressed that leaving was a difficult choice. Both executives received thanks from CEO Elon Musk for their contributions to the company via social media posts.

These developments follow an internal email sent by Musk, announcing that Tesla would cut ""more than 10%"" of its global workforce. The company ended 2023 with over 140,000 employees, meaning that the layoffs could impact more than 14,000 people. The decision comes as Tesla grapples with a year-over-year drop in sales, cooling demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and increased global competition.

Musk emphasized the need for cost reductions and increased productivity, stating, ""This will enable us to be lean, innovative, and hungry for the next growth phase cycle."" The company is also in between product cycles, with the expensive Cybertruck recently starting production and the popular Model Y entering its fourth year without significant updates.

In addition to the layoffs, Tesla has been slashing prices on its most popular models to counterbalance the impact of high-interest rates and increased competition. Furthermore, the company has reportedly dropped or delayed plans for a lower-cost EV, initially expected to retail at around $25,000. Instead, Tesla is focusing on an alleged robotaxi that Musk announced would debut on August 8.

The strategic shift and leadership changes come after Tesla reported shipping a record 1.8 million EVs in 2023. However, the company has faced challenges in maintaining sales growth, warning investors that growth could be ""notably lower"" than","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cybertruck_78.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-15 14:33:20,"Meta Description:
