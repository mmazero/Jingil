Introduction

In the world of esports, where competition is fierce and glory awaits the victor, sometimes things take a dark turn. This was evident recently when an unknown hacker decided to shake up an Apex Legends tournament by making it seem like two prominent streamers were cheating. With the situation seemingly under control following patches deployed by the game's developers, let's delve deeper into the timeline of events, the actors involved, and the implications for the gaming community.

The Incident Unfolds

It began last month when a mysterious hacker disrupted an Apex Legends esports tournament by hijacking the streams of two renowned gamers, ImperialHal and Geburten. The intrusion made it appear as though these players were utilizing cheat codes, causing chaos in the gaming community. Fortunately, the tournament organizer suspended the event shortly after the incident.

Developers Patch Things Up

Two days post-incident, Apex Legends developer Respawn announced through its official X account that it had initiated ""a layered series of updates"" aimed at safeguarding the game's player base. Another update followed suit a week later, designed to offer additional protection to Apex Legend's users while preserving the game's competitive spirit. Although Respawn stopped short of explicitly linking these updates to the tournament tampering, Destroyer2009—the pseudonymous perpetrator—confirmed to TechCrunch that the newly implemented fixes resolved the weakness he leveraged to execute the attack.

Communication Breakdown

Despite numerous attempts by TechCrunch to obtain confirmation regarding the resolution of the exploit, both Respawn and parent company Electronic Arts declined to comment on the matter. Furthermore, the duo failed to address previous queries pertaining to the topic over recent weeks.

Hacker Speaks Out

Although unwilling to share specifics about the bug he took advantage of, Destroyer2009 expressed remorse for potentially damaging Respawn's reputation beyond repair. He revealed testing his exploit after the release of Respawn's second update on March 26th, acknowledging that it might have been addressed earlier due to a lack of opportunity to verify prior to the announcement. In response to Respawn's recent blunder involving a faulty in-game upgrade, the hacker noted, ""[embarrassing them] even more is probably not fair."" Following the Apex Legends tournament fiasco, Destroyer2009 declared that he would refrain from conducting similar stunts in the immediate future, stating, ""Anything more severe than the 'accident' will be considered as a genuine hacking incident with all the associated consequences, so I'll likely return to simply playing the game until it becomes dull again as normal.""

Impact on the Community

With nearly 2.5 million combined followers across Twitch, ImperialHal and Geburten boast substantial influence among Apex Legends fans. Consequently, reactions to the incident reverberated throughout the gaming community, sparking widespread debate around the security measures employed by Respawn. Despite the controversy, however, many questions remain unanswered thanks to Respawn's reluctance to shed light on the issue.

Conclusion

While the dust has settled on this particular episode, the Apex Legends hacking saga serves as a stark reminder that cybersecurity extends far beyond traditional domains. As technology continues permeating every aspect of life, including online gaming tournaments, ensuring robust protections against potential threats must become a top priority for industry stakeholders and enthusiasts alike. By fostering transparency and open dialogue surrounding such incidents, developers can build trust amongst their user bases and strengthen their overall brand resilience.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/apex-legends-concept-art.png?resize=1200,675",2024-04-18 13:00:21,"Meta Description: Learn about the Apex Legends hacking scandal where two streamers were falsely accused of cheating.

Introduction

In today's digital world, choosing the right web browser is essential for ensuring both productivity and security. While some people remain loyal to their preferred options, others—like myself—enjoy exploring various alternatives for diverse tasks. In recent times, I have found myself alternating among Opera, Arc, and Brave browsers. Although Opera's Workspaces feature keeps drawing me back due to its excellent tab management capabilities, Brave has consistently enticed me with its unique blend of robust security measures, ease-of-use, and innovative features. So, let us delve deeper into why Brave deserves recognition as a superior choice compared to numerous other browsers currently available.

Security and Privacy

When prioritizing online security and privacy, utilizing Tor Browser is generally considered the ideal solution. However, Brave comes next in line, offering the most secure Chromium-based browsing experience on the market—even surpassing Google Chrome. By default, Brave safeguards user privacy through several mechanisms, such as preventing cross-site cookie tracking, bounce tracking, fingerprinting, phishing attempts, and malware threats. Additionally, Brave provides transparency regarding blocked items via its Shield icon, enabling automatic HTTPS connection upgrades, and integrates seamlessly with the Tor network when activating Private Browsing mode. Moreover, Brave Search serves as the browser's native search engine, promoting ad-free private searching experiences.

Open Source Advantage

Initially, Brave faced criticism for embedding referral codes into URLs without proper disclosure; however, upon recognizing the issue, Brave reversed course by becoming open source. Based on the Chromium platform, this decision enhanced credibility and trustworthiness, allowing developers and users alike to review the browser's source code on the official Brave GitHub page. Given the option, supporting open-source projects remains preferable given their inherent benefits over closed-source counterparts.

Clean Link Feature

Among Brave's standout features, its 'Copy Clean Link' function ranks high on the list. When sharing hyperlinks containing unwanted affiliate, referral, or tracking parameters, clicking the magnifying glass icon located beside the address bar yields a 'Copy Clean Link' option. Users may utilize this functionality directly or employ the context menu associated with any desired link. Consequently, recipients receive only the required URL instead of unnecessary embedded information.

News Configuration Options

As someone continually seeking updates, Brave simplifies customization of news feed preferences according to individual interests. Unlike certain competitors, Brave allows selective configuration of information sources, encompassing specific websites and subject categories. Upon establishing personalized preferences, opening a new tab displays relevant articles along with a dedicated News icon present at the bottom. Thus, users maintain control over displayed content, avoiding potential distractions stemming from involuntary news presentation.

Minimalistic yet Functional Sidebars

Featuring minimalist design principles, Brave incorporates collapsible sidebars on both sides of the interface. Minimizing the left sidebar preserves space for managing tabs, whereas revealing the hidden right sidebar permits convenient access to AI, Wallet, Bookmarks, and Library functions. Flexibly adjusting these elements offers increased viewing real estate, ultimately improving overall user experience.

Performance Efficiency

Boasting remarkable performance efficiency, Brave outpaces competing browsers during speed tests conducted via platforms like Speedometer 3.0. Furthermore, its Memory Saver mechanism conservatively allocates RAM resources solely towards active tabs, enhancing responsiveness and eliminating redundant resource consumption. Users can even exclude frequently visited websites from Memory Saver optimization, maintaining consistent performance levels throughout extended sessions.

Built-in Reading Mode

Lastly, Brave houses a Speed Reading mode designed to streamline webpage navigation and facilitate focused reading experiences. Eliminating extraneous visual noise enables readers to consume content effortlessly, especially amidst cluttered pages riddled with excessive advertising. Compared to rivals requiring cumbersome extensions for similar functionalities, Brave elegantly addresses this requirement natively.

Conclusion

While selecting a web browser often boils down to personal preference, considering factors beyond mere familiarity occasionally proves beneficial. Through examining key aspects such as security, convenience, performance efficiency, and innovation, Brave emerges triumphant against countless alternative solutions. Whether dabbling in unfamiliar territory or contemplating switching allegiances, experiencing Brave firsthand could prove transformative for those craving heightened security, improved workflow, and cutting-edge technology integrated harmoniously within a single package.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a2edb4d355b9b64f7342200ed70d291679af0ad8/2024/04/17/ab341994-710f-4d38-a26f-e69b1187a4a0/bravehero.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-17 00:00:00,"""Discover Brave - Secure, Fast & Ad-Free!

SEO Title: Nzero's Algorithm Illuminates Building Carbon Emissions for Reduction","Title: Illuminating Carbon Emissions: How Nzero's Innovative Algorithm Helps Building Owners Reduce Their Environmental Impact

Introduction

In an era where sustainability and environmental responsibility have become paramount, many building owners find themselves in the dark regarding their carbon footprint. Starting in 2023, thousands of buildings in New York City must begin reducing their carbon emissions. To effectively tackle this challenge, building owners first need to comprehend the extent of their carbon pollution. This article introduces Nzero, a groundbreaking carbon-tracking startup, and its novel algorithm designed to help building owners accurately measure and minimize their carbon emissions.

Understanding Current Challenges

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity accounts for approximately 60% of the overall energy consumption in commercial buildings. While numerous tools exist to approximate carbon emissions based on electric bills, many rely on imprecise estimations. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of intermittent wind and solar power necessitates understanding not only how much electricity is used but also when it is consumed.

Nzero's Solution: An Hourly Accurate Algorithm

To address these challenges, Nzero has created a sophisticated algorithm capable of providing building owners with detailed hourly reports on their carbon pollution. Although some building owners may already possess such granular data through advanced metering and sensor technology, others lack access to this level of detail. According to John Rula, Nzero's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), ""Better data leads to better results, but it shouldn't be a barrier.""

Triple Net Lease REITs: A Unique Challenge

A particular group facing difficulties in addressing carbon emissions is Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) specializing in triple net leases, which are popular among investors due to various financial benefits. In this arrangement, the REIT assumes responsibility for a building's emissions; however, since property owners typically don't cover utility costs, gaining insights into the generated pollution proves challenging. As Rula explains, ""They're pleading with tenants to share this data with minimal success.""

Generating Data-Driven Estimates

By leveraging a building's address and supplementary details like square footage and heating/cooling system specifications, Nzero creates precise emission estimates. These calculations offer greater accuracy compared to previous methods utilized by building owners. After obtaining initial estimates, Nzero's software assists building owners in identifying upgrades and retrofits aimed at minimizing emissions without sacrificing cost efficiency.

Embracing Decarbonization Through Streamlined Steps

Rula emphasizes that data collection and regulatory compliance aren't ultimate objectives—decarbonization remains the overarching goal. By simplifying complex processes associated with decarbonization efforts, Nzero empowers building owners to focus on making informed decisions and implementing impactful changes. Ultimately, Nzero envisions fostering widespread adoption of sustainable practices across the industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1126706015.jpg?resize=1200,856",2024-04-18 13:00:40,"Discover Nzero's cutting-edge algorithm measuring & reducing building carbon emissions!

Compared to its bulky, exosuit-like predecessor, the electric Atlas presents a sleeker appearance, featuring a smooth, minimalist head devoid of facial features. Instead, the nondescript dome bears a striking resemblance to a popular photography accessory—a ring light. Despite lacking anthropomorphic characteristics, the new design provides enhanced efficiency in completing tasks without sacrificing mobility. According to Boston Dynamics, “Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are equipping the robot to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a task, rather than being constrained by a human range of motion.”

In collaboration with its parent company, Hyundai, Boston Dynamics aims to leverage the next generation of automotive manufacturing technology as a test bed for novel Atlas applications. Over time, they plan to expand the robot's abilities and demonstrate its full potential alongside select industry partners. Additionally, researchers are exploring innovative gripper systems tailored to diverse commercial requirements, enhancing Atlas' existing capacity to manipulate cumbersome and irregularly shaped items. With increased power and versatility, the revamped Atlas strives to prove itself indispensable across multiple sectors.

Marc Raibert, founder of Boston Dynamics, expressed his confidence in the company's vision: ""Combining decades of practical experience with first principles thinking, we are confident in our ability to deliver a robot uniquely capable of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks in real applications."" Indeed, despite fierce competition from companies such as Tesla and Menteebot, Boston Dynamics remains at the forefront of humanoid robot development.

It stays within the character limit, making it ideal for search engine ranking purposes.","Title: Maximizing Efficiency in Ternary Organic Solar Cells: The Key Role of Guest Acceptors

Introduction

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained significant attention in the field of organic electronics, thanks to their lightweight nature, remarkable mechanical flexibility, and transparency. Among the various approaches to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs, the ternary strategy has emerged as a promising and straightforward method. This strategy involves the introduction of a guest component into a host binary system. However, predicting the effectiveness of guest components in improving device efficiency remains a challenge.

A research team led by Prof. Ge Ziyi at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has proposed a crucial strategy for optimizing guest components to minimize non-radiative voltage losses and achieve high-efficiency ternary OSCs (Ziyi et al., 2024). In this study, the team designed and synthesized three asymmetrical non-fullerene acceptors (ANFs) with different electrostatic potential (ESP) distributions as guest acceptors in a well-known host system, D18:N3. The findings reveal that a larger ESP difference between the guest acceptor and the host system leads to stronger intermolecular interactions, higher luminescent efficiency of the blend film, and improved electroluminescence quantum yield (EQE EL) of the device. Ultimately, this approach results in reduced voltage loss in ternary OSCs.

The Importance of Electrostatic Potential Difference

The team's research results highlight the significance of the electrostatic potential difference between the guest acceptor and the host system. By carefully selecting and designing guest acceptors with an appropriate ESP difference, the device's open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be effectively increased. This finding is further supported by the verification of this rule in other reported high-efficiency ternary OSCs, demonstrating its excellent generality.

Designing High-Efficiency Guest Acceptors

By employing density functional theory calculations, the researchers designed and synthesized three ANFs with distinct ESP distributions, namely ANF-1, ANF-2, and ANF-3. These ANFs were then introduced as guest acceptors in the D1",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-method-proposed-1.jpg,2024-04-17 10:53:07,":N3 host system to form ternary blends. Impressively, all three ANFs showed enhanced EQE EL values compared to the control group, indicating better charge carrier recombination properties. Most notably, ANF-3 demonstrated the highest PCE (5.79%) among them due to its largest ESP difference from the host material, which resulted in the lowest voltage loss.

Implications for Future Research

These intriguing discoveries emphasize the need for future investigations to examine other factors affecting voltage losses in OSCs beyond the simple consideration of ESP differences. Additionally, understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for these improvements will pave the way towards developing even more efficient devices using advanced strategies like tailored energy levels or synergistic effects.

However, the Bristol Robotics Laboratory team drew inspiration from the adaptive suction abilities of octopus biological suckers, which can attach to challenging surfaces like rocks and shells. By examining the structures of these suckers, the researchers uncovered the secret behind their impressive suction skills.

The study reveals that the octopus's adaptive suction is a result of both mechanical deformation and mucus secretion. The soft body of the organism conforms to the surface shape, while the high-viscosity mucus helps attach to complex surfaces. The research team successfully replicated this dual mechanism in their new technology by creating a multi-layer soft structure and an artificial fluidic system.

Tianqi Yue, the lead author, explains, ""Our main breakthrough is the combination of mechanical conformation and liquid seal, allowing the suction cup to adapt to complex surfaces. This may also be the key to understanding how biological organisms achieve adaptive suction.""

The team's multi-scale suction mechanism combines mechanical conformation and regulated water seal. The soft material deforms to match the substrate, minimizing leaking apertures. Then, an artificial fluidic system seals the remaining micron-sized gaps with regulated water secretion. This mechanism significantly improves suction longevity on various surfaces while reducing overflow.

The potential applications for this new technology are vast, particularly in industrial settings. The pump-free suction cup offers a more energy-efficient solution, addressing the noise and energy waste issues associated with always-on air pumps in current industrial solutions.

The research team has discovered a new class of materials for chemical storage of hydrogen, which can absorb four times as much hydrogen as the current top contenders. These materials, cesium heptahydride (CsH7) and rubidium nonahydride (RbH9), can store an unprecedented number of hydrogen atoms per metal atom – seven and nine, respectively. This exceptional storage capacity is due to the larger size of cesium and rubidium atoms, which results in bigger voids in the crystal structure for hydrogen to occupy.

The synthesis process involves reacting hydrogen-rich powder of ammonia borane with either cesium or rubidium, followed by heat decomposition that produces cesium or rubidium monohydrides and hydrogen. The extra hydrogen generated during this process is then forced into the crystal lattice voids under high pressure, forming cesium heptahydride and rubidium nonahydride.

Imagine you're a pioneering founder who has developed a groundbreaking technology to produce hydrogen more affordably and efficiently than ever before. Your innovative solution secured substantial funding in initial rounds, totaling millions of dollars, to demonstrate its potential. The technology works even better than anticipated, and now the challenge is to build a commercial-scale plant—the dreaded ""commercial valley of death."" This critical juncture often poses problems for many climate tech startups, as traditional financiers hesitate due to the numerous uncertainties involved.

Enter Trellis Climate, a new initiative by climate nonprofit Prime Coalition, aiming to fill the funding gap in the middle stages, where capital becomes increasingly scarce. Prime Coalition has always set itself apart from other for-profit finance entities by not only investing in startups through its Prime Impact Fund but also guiding philanthropists to allocate their resources to high-impact climate-related projects. Trellis Climate follows the latter approach, concentrating on the middle stages that see a decrease in funding opportunities.

Lara Pierpoint, Director of Trellis Climate, shared her thoughts with TechCrunch, highlighting the growing interest among philanthropists in addressing the climate crisis, ""The highest, best use of philanthropy is in trying new ideas, in really swinging for the fences on the things that have a very high impact potential. It is the most flexible and potentially risk-forward set of dollars that are out there.""

For climate tech founders, this type of funding could be a much-needed lifeline. Early-stage entrepreneurs have access to various capital sources, including numerous venture capital funds and federal grants. While this support might not be enough to prevent the planet from warming by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, it has been sufficient to stimulate growth in the industry and keep climate tech investors engaged.

However, there has been an assumption that climate technologies proven effective would be scaled up by corporations and industries. Unfortunately, Pierpoint pointed out, ""a lot of companies are really getting pushed to do the things that create immediate shareholder value."" Consequently, a growing divide has emerged in the middle stages.

Team

Introduction

Space is becoming increasingly congested, with a growing number of defunct satellites and debris orbiting Earth. This poses significant risks to operational satellites and future space missions. A Paris-based startup, Dark, is tackling this issue head-on with its innovative solution—Interceptor, a spacecraft designed to attach to and de-orbit uncooperative objects. Dark's CEO, Clyde Laheyne, describes the company as the ""S.W.A.T. team of space,"" ready to intervene at a moment's notice.

The Interceptor Concept

Interceptor is a rocket-powered boxing glove, launched from a specially outfitted aircraft, that gently punches wayward objects out of their orbits. The spacecraft is designed to operate like an air defense missile, always ready for immediate use. Unlike traditional missiles or anti-satellite weapons, Interceptor's gentle strike doesn't produce a debris field or other unpredictable effects.

Dark's Founders and Funding

Dark was founded by Clyde Laheyne and CTO Guillaume Orvain, who gained valuable experience at MBDA, a multi-national missile developer. The company has secured $5 million in funding from European investors, including lead investor Eurazeo, and an additional $6 million from its first U.S.-based investor, Long Journey Ventures, led by Arielle Zuckerberg.

Development and Demonstration Missions

Dark's team is currently focusing on developing critical systems, such as the cryogenic engine and software. They are also working on long-distance detecting and tracking, autonomous flight algorithms, and controlled reentry systems for the quick, unplanned missions Interceptor will execute. To validate the core technologies, Dark plans two demonstration missions:

1. In 2026, the first mission will involve touching an object in space, a feat no company has achieved yet.
2. The second mission, planned for 2027, will attempt to de-orbit an object. If successful, Dark will begin de-orbiting objects for allied civil agencies, with defense customers hopefully remaining unnecessary.

Autonomous vehicles are becoming an increasingly common sight on city streets, and companies like Waymo are leading the charge in testing and refining this technology. However, a recent incident in San Francisco involving six Waymo robotaxis blocking traffic on the Potrero Avenue 101 on-ramp has sparked conversations about the readiness of self-driving vehicles for prime time.

At around 9:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, a lineup of six Waymo robotaxis found themselves in a tricky situation. While returning to Waymo's city depot, the first vehicle encountered a road closure marked by traffic cones. The only available alternative was to merge onto the freeway, which California regulators recently approved for Waymo's autonomous robotaxi service—without a human driver—testing. However, the company is still utilizing human drivers during freeway tests in California.

As the first robotaxi came to a stop after the road closure, the five following Waymo vehicles automatically halted behind it. Unfortunately, human-driven cars were then unable to pass, leading some drivers to exit their vehicles and physically move the cones to continue their journey. This situation, captured on video and posted to Reddit, highlights the challenges faced by both human drivers and autonomous vehicles sharing the road.

Waymo quickly responded to the incident by dispatching its Roadside Assistance team to manually retrieve the vehicles. The entire event lasted no more than 30 minutes. While this is not the first time Waymo's autonomous vehicles have obstructed traffic, it is the first documented incident involving a freeway.

Cruise, GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has faced criticism for multiple cases of its vehicles malfunctioning and blocking traffic, emergency services, and public transit. Although human drivers occasionally cause similar situations, city officials and first responders in San Francisco have voiced concerns about their inability to move robotaxis when they're in the way and issue traffic citations—since a human driver must be present for citations to be given.

Introduction

Wind power has long been hailed as a cost-effective and renewable source of energy. However, a common misconception persists - the belief that wind farms require vast tracts of land, making them less appealing than traditional fossil fuel-based power plants. A new study led by McGill University, which analyzed nearly 320 wind farms in the U.S., challenges this notion and offers a fresh perspective on wind energy's land use efficiency.

The True Impact of Wind Farms on Land Use

The study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, reveals that the actual land used for wind power infrastructure accounts for only 5% of the entire wind farm area. The remaining 95% is often utilized for other purposes, such as agriculture or wildlife habitats. This finding highlights the potential for multifunctional use of land, where wind turbines coexist with existing activities.

Moreover, when accounting for the entire infrastructure, including roads and pre-existing facilities, wind energy outperforms gas-fired generation in terms of land use efficiency. This revelation refutes the belief that wind farms are less land-friendly than gas-fired power plants.

Leveraging Existing Infrastructure for Enhanced Efficiency

The research also indicates that wind turbines located in areas with existing roads and infrastructure, such as agricultural land, can produce energy seven times more efficiently per square meter than projects developed on previously undeveloped land. This insight underscores the importance of strategic planning in wind farm development.

Senior author Sarah Jordaan, an associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at McGill, explains, ""The land use of wind farms has often been viewed as among the predominant challenges to wind development. However, by quantifying the land area used by nearly 16,000 wind turbines in the western U.S., we found that gas-fired generation offers no real benefits in terms of lesser land use when the infrastructures, including all the wells, pipelines, and roads associated with the natural gas supply chain, are considered.""

In the heart of our Milky Way galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, but it's not the only one of its kind. Scattered throughout the galaxy are smaller stellar black holes, the remnants of massive stars that have undergone gravitational collapse. Scientists estimate that there are around 100 million of these stellar black holes in our galaxy, although most remain undiscovered. Among the known black holes, their size typically ranges from around 10 times the mass of our sun to a maximum of 21 solar masses. However, thanks to the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, we have recently encountered a stellar black hole of a whopping 33 solar masses, the largest yet observed in our galaxy. Moreover, it is situated a mere 1,926 light-years away from Earth.

Initially designated as Gaia BH3, this colossal black hole was identified by ESA scientists examining data from the Gaia mission, searching for anomalies. A particular wobbling giant star in the nearby Aquila constellation piqued their interest, eventually revealing that it was orbiting a massive black hole. Despite its proximity to Earth, making it the second-closest known black hole, Gaia BH3 proved challenging to locate. It does not have nearby celestial bodies to feed it matter and emit X-rays detectable by telescopes. Previously, black holes of comparable size had only been found in distant galaxies.

Data from ground-based telescopes, including the European Southern Observatory, were used to confirm the immense size of Gaia BH3. The star orbiting it has an extremely low abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Since binary star systems tend to share similar compositions, the progenitor star that collapsed to form BH3 was likely the same.

Scientists have long speculated that metal-poor stars could generate high-mass black holes upon collapse, as they lose less mass throughout their lifetimes. They retain more material during their death, providing enough mass to form a massive black hole. Gaia BH3 offers the first concrete evidence of this connection between metal-poor stars and massive stellar black holes.

In the realm of robotics, the development of soft skin covers embedded with touch sensors has emerged as a promising innovation, enhancing safety and intuition in human interaction. However, these advanced features often come with high production costs and complex manufacturing processes. A groundbreaking study, conducted by Joohyung Kim and his team, has unveiled an efficient solution to this challenge through the use of 3D printers to create soft skin pads that also function as pressure-based mechanical sensors.

According to the study's lead researcher, Joohyung Kim, a professor of electrical & computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, ""Robotic hardware can involve large forces and torques, so it needs to be made quite safe if it's going to either directly interact with humans or be used in human environments. It's expected that soft skin will play an important role in this regard since it can be used for both mechanical safety compliance and tactile sensing.""

The newly developed 3D-printed pads serve a dual purpose: they act as a soft skin covering for a robotic arm and as pressure-based mechanical sensors.
