https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-google-delete-incognito-privacy.html,Google to delete incognito search data to end privacy suit, Google to Delete Incognito Search Data; End Privacy Suit settlement ,"Google has recently announced that it is working to replace software cookies that track the internet activity of its Chrome users. This move aims to safeguard people's privacy while still allowing effective targeting of ads. In addition, Google has agreed to delete a vast trove of search data as part of a settlement to resolve a suit that it tracked millions of US users who believed they were browsing the internet privately.

According to the settlement, Google must delete and/or remediate billions of data records linked to people using the Chrome browser's Incognito mode. This is an historic step in requiring dominant technology companies to be honest in their representations to users about how they collect and employ user data. The settlement calls for no cash damages to be paid but leaves an option for Chrome users who feel they were wronged to sue Google separately to get money.

The lawsuit originally filed in June of 2020 sought at least $5 billion in damages. The object of the lawsuit was the ""Incognito Mode"" in the Chrome browser that plaintiffs said gave users a false sense that what they were surfing online was not being tracked by the Silicon Valley tech firm. However, internal Google emails brought forward in the lawsuit demonstrated that users using incognito mode were being followed by the search and advertising behemoth for measuring web traffic and selling ads.

The lawsuit claimed that Google's practices infringed on users' privacy by intentionally deceiving them with the incognito option. The original complaint alleged that Google had been given the ""power to learn intimate details about individuals' lives, interests, and internet usage.""

To address this issue, the settlement requires Google to block third-party tracking ""cookies"" by default in Incognito Mode for the next five years. Third-party cookies are small files that are used to target advertising by tracking web navigation and are placed by visited sites and not by the browser itself.

Google earlier this year began limiting third-party cookies for some users of its Chrome browser, a first step towards eventually abandoning the files that have raised privacy concerns. Google announced in January 2020 that it would begin eliminating third-party cookies within two years, but the start has been delayed several times amid opposition from web media publishers.

Cookies have recently been subject to greater regulation, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation introduced in 2016 as well as regulations in California.

In conclusion, Google's move to replace software cookies with a more privacy-focused approach is a positive step towards safeguarding users' privacy while still allowing effective targeting of ads. The settlement to resolve the suit that tracked millions of US users who believed they were browsing the internet privately is also a historic step in requiring dominant technology companies to be honest in their representations to users about how they collect and employ user data. The requirement to block third-party tracking ""cookies"" by default in Incognito Mode for the next five years is a step towards eventually abandoning the files that have raised privacy concerns and will help to protect users' privacy in the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/google-has-said-it-is.jpg,2024-04-01 16:00:22,"The enhanced Meta description for the news article is:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/techcrunch-mobility-03-31-24/,Fisker enters into dumpster fire territory and Tesla chases FSD revenue," EV Startups: Fisker Struggles, Lucid Raises $1 Billion, and More ","Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be taking a closer look at the latest developments in the world of EV startups, from Fisker's temporary production pause to Lucid's latest $1 billion investment. We'll also be highlighting some exciting new startups and technologies in the field, so buckle up and get ready to stay on top of the latest trends and innovations.

First, let's dive into Fisker's recent struggles. As TC reported, the company issued a warning in March that it was pausing production for six weeks and had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $32 million of that restricted or not immediately accessible. Fisker was counting on a $150 million influx of capital via convertible notes and a potential partnership with another automaker, but those hopes were quickly dashed when negotiations with the large automaker (reportedly Nissan) fell apart and put that convertible note deal in jeopardy.

Fisker's troubles didn't stop there, though. TC reporter Sean O'Kane uncovered a particularly embarrassing internal audit that led to the temporary loss of millions of dollars in customer payments as Fisker scaled up deliveries. The audit took months to complete and was a major blow to the company's reputation.

Despite these challenges, Fisker is not alone in the world of EV startups. In fact, there has been a lot of positive news coming out of the sector lately. For example, Lucid, which has had its own struggles, raised another $1 billion from its biggest financial backer, Saudi Arabia. Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock, adding to the Kingdom's current stake of around 60% ownership.

This influx of capital is a significant boost for Lucid, which must successfully bring its next vehicle, the Gravity SUV, to market and drum up fresh business for its existing Air sedan if it hopes to survive and scale. But the road ahead is not an easy one, as the EV startup landscape remains competitive, and the global economic downturn has only made things more challenging.

Still, there are some promising developments in the world of EV startups. For example, Canadian startup Cyvl.ai raised $6 million in funding to help municipalities and civil engineering firms track the conditions of transportation infrastructure. Ember, a Scottish startup building one of the U.K.'s first all-electric intercity bus networks, also raised $14 million in a Series A round.

And that's not all. Seed-stage startup Ionobell claims its silicon material will be cheaper than the established competition and help boost range in EV batteries. The company raised an unpriced $3.9 million seed extension, with Dynamo Ventures and Trucks VC leading the round.

Of course, there are many other exciting developments in the world of transportation and EVs, and we'll be sure to keep you up to date on all of them.

Introduction

Our modern world heavily relies on hydrocarbons like crude oil and natural gas for energy. However, these resources are finite, difficult to extract, and contribute to carbon emissions. Terraform Industries has developed an innovative solution called the Terraformer, which produces hydrocarbons using electricity and air. The company recently announced the successful commissioning of a demonstrator Terraformer, producing synthetic natural gas for the first time.

The Terraformer: A Revolutionary Approach

The Terraformer is a system, roughly the size of two shipping containers, composed of three subsystems:

1. An electrolyzer that converts solar power into hydrogen
2. A direct air capture system that captures CO2
3. A chemical reactor that combines both inputs to produce pipeline-grade synthetic natural gas

Terraform Industries has optimized the Terraformer for a one-megawatt solar array, making it an efficient and eco-friendly solution. While electrolysis and Sabatier chemical reactors are not new concepts, Terraform Industries has innovated by building a proprietary direct air capture system and adapting the entire process to work with a variable energy source, solar power.

Staggering Cost Reductions and Business Viability

Terraform Industries boasts significant cost reductions with its system converting clean electricity into hydrogen at less than $2.50 per kilogram of H2, and the direct air capture system filtering CO2 for less than $250 per ton. These prices are expected to decrease further as the company builds more Terraformers and leverages the growth of affordable solar power.

To ensure a strong business case, Terraform Industries plans to bring the cost of synthetic natural gas in line with conventionally sourced liquified natural gas. The company also intends to expand its product line to include standalone electrolyzers, liquid fuels, and methane.

First Sales and Future Plans

Terraform Industries has agreements to sell the small amounts of natural gas it produces to two undisclosed utilities. This marks a significant step towards the company's goal of producing gas that meets industry standards. The company is also taking reservations for the first production Ter","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reactor-and-Gas-Injection-System.jpg?resize=1200,772",2024-04-01 17:05:04,"Meta Description (under 18 words): ""Terraform Industries revolutionizes energy with its breakthrough - synthetic natural gas from electricity & air.""

Highlights:

 New study questions strict purity standards for lithium in batteries
 Specific Mg impurity may boost efficiency & extend battery life
 Low-purity lithium can cut CO2 emissions, lower costs","Title: Rethinking Lithium Purity: A Path to More Sustainable Batteries

Introduction

The quest for enhanced productivity, longevity, and eco-friendliness in secondary battery cathode materials has brought the purification of magnesium impurities to the forefront. Manufacturers of secondary battery cells, such as LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK, have been adamant about stringent purity specifications from suppliers of cathode materials. However, a recent study published in Nature Communications reveals that these purity requirements might be more rigorous than necessary.

The Study

A research team, led by Professor Yong-Tae Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), examined the relationship between lithium raw material purity and the production and performance of secondary battery cathode materials. Contrary to the widely-accepted assumption that impurities in lithium materials negatively impact battery performance, the team discovered that a specific magnesium (Mg) impurity could potentially enhance process efficiency and extend the battery's lifespan.

The Findings

The researchers demonstrated that utilizing low-purity lithium, not entirely devoid of impurities, could reduce secondary battery production costs and carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19.4% and 9.0%, respectively. This discovery could provide secondary battery cell manufacturers with a fresh perspective in their quest to compete against China's aggressively low prices while promoting sustainability.

Implications

As manufacturers strive to meet stringent purity specifications, raw material costs have been on the rise. However, this latest study suggests that re-evaluating these specifications could lead to substantial cost savings and environmental benefits.

Professor Kim remarked, ""Secondary battery cell manufacturers should reassess whether their current cathode material specifications are overly stringent. By considering unconventional approaches, they may uncover a new strategy to tackle the challenges posed by China's competitive pricing.""

Conclusion

This research offers valuable insights into the potential advantages of revisiting purity specifications in the production of secondary battery cathode materials. By embracing a more flexible approach to material purity, manufacturers could unlock significant cost savings and environmental benefits without compromising",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/are-high-purity-cathod.jpg,2024-04-01 16:36:35,"Discover the potential of lower-purity lithium for sustainable, cost-effective secondary batteries.

Beyoncé's latest masterpiece, ""Cowboy Carter,"" has taken the world by storm, breaking records and garnering widespread acclaim. Amidst the celebration, Beyoncé made a bold statement against the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in music creation. This article delves into her reasons for speaking out, the issues surrounding AI-generated music, and how ""Cowboy Carter"" serves as a testament to the power of authentic artistry.

Beyoncé's Grievances with AI in Music

In a rare interview, Beyoncé expressed her concerns about the increasing presence of AI in music, stating, ""The joy of creating music is that there are no rules. The more I see the world evolving, the more I felt a deeper connection to purity. With artificial intelligence and digital filters and programming, I wanted to go back to real instruments."" Her comments highlight the tension between the human element of music creation and the efficiency of AI-generated compositions.

The Dark Side of AI-Generated Art

The primary issue with AI-generated music is the unauthorized use of artists' work for training purposes.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-gmail-arrived-20-years-ago-people-thought-it-was-an-april-fools-prank/,"When Gmail arrived 20 years ago, people thought it was an April Fools prank","

In the 20 years since its launch, Gmail has become the go-to email service for millions of people. Its groundbreaking features like unlimited storage and search have made it a favorite among users, and its constant updates and additions have ensured it remains relevant and useful today. Despite controversy and changes in communication habits, Gmail remains a reliable and effective tool for email communication. ","

In the annals of technology history, Gmail's launch on April 1, 2004, will undoubtedly be remembered as a pivotal moment. At the time, Google's announcement of its own email platform was met with skepticism, as many believed it to be an April Fool's Day prank. However, as it turned out, Gmail was far from a joke.

Google's advertised 1 GB of free storage was a staggering amount for the time, dwarfing email alternatives like Hotmail and Yahoo, which offered a mere fraction of that amount. Fast forward to 2021, and Gmail is not only still going strong but has become the undisputed king of email with 1.2 billion users under its belt. And with a storage limit of up to 15 GB per user, Gmail has come a long way since its humble beginnings.

In the original press release, Google highlighted the ability to search for a specific message, a groundbreaking feature at the time, and the unprecedented storage space. ""Gmail is built on the idea that users should never have to file or delete a message or struggle to find an email they've sent or received,"" the press release read.

Over the years, Gmail has continued to evolve and add new features to make emailing easier and more efficient. In 2005, Google doubled its available storage size to 2 GB per user, and in 2006, it launched the companion Google Calendar. Google Chat was introduced the same year, and the service went fully public on February 14, 2007.

In 2008, Gmail saw the addition of perhaps its most useful feature -- the forgotten attachment detector, followed by the much-needed ""undo send"" in 2009. The same year saw offline access added, and the service continued to grow, adding an iOS app in 2011. In 2012, Gmail saw an upgrade to 10 GB of storage, and by 2013, the storage limit had reached its current 15 GB limit.

Small features have been added through the years, like smart replies, one-click unsubscribe, an integrated view that makes it easier to move between Google apps, and even automatic translation capability and AI features that can write messages for you.

Despite its popularity, Gmail's time hasn't been without controversy. Prior to 2017, Google's email service automatically scanned the text of each message not only to detect spam or malware but to place relevant advertising alongside. After facing several lawsuits around that practice, particularly concerning matters of race, religion, health, finances, or sexual orientation, Google announced it would stop reading users' emails and use other data sources for contextual ads.

Additionally, a 2018 report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that third-party developers were able to scan hundreds of millions of user emails.

For the most part, though, the service has been the gold standard for email for many years now, and the go-to option for most people.

So, what's the future for Gmail? As an elder millennial on the cusp of Generation X and a Gmail user from the beta days, I remember when email was the main method of communication with far-flung friends and family. But now, with the proliferation of apps like Slack and Teams for work and Messenger and WhatsApp for conversations, I can't remember the last time I used email for actual communication with someone.

Even official things like plane tickets or hotel reservations, for which Gmail used to be my repository, are now accessed through apps. However, for record-keeping, email remains my standard. And of course, email isn't limited to a single platform, as you can still easily access anyone with an email address. Email is better for large mailing lists, and for sending documents and other files, and it's more secure than most messaging apps.

Communication has certainly changed in the two decades since Gmail came onto the scene, and while the purpose of email has changed, it's clear it isn't going anywhere.

Introduction

In the quest for miniaturized optoelectronic devices that consume less power yet deliver superior performance, scientists have turned their attention towards two-dimensional (2D) superconducting materials. However, achieving high gate capacitance in these small devices poses a significant challenge. This issue can be addressed by using insulating materials with a high dielectric constant (κ); unfortunately, integrating these materials with 2D semiconductors has proven to be difficult. Researchers from Fudan University have made a breakthrough in preparing a 2D perovskite oxide with high-κ that can seamlessly integrate with diverse 2D channel materials. This discovery could revolutionize the future scaling of optoelectronics.

A Novel Approach to Boost Gate Capacitance

Conventional three-dimensional dielectrics face integration difficulties when working with 2D materials featuring dangling-bond-free surfaces. Recognizing this limitation, the research team led by Siyuan Li and Xinya Liu focused on the 2D perovskite oxide Sr₂Nb₃O₁₀, which shows exceptional potential due to its high dielectric constant (κ=24.6) and moderate bandgap. By employing a top-down preparation strategy, the team successfully synthesized SNO nanosheets and subsequently transferred them onto various 2D materials.

Advantageous Characteristics of Sr₂Nb₃O₁₀

The unique properties of Sr₂Nb₃O₁₀ render it an ideal candidate for application in phototransistors based on multiple 2D semiconducting materials, such as graphene, molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂), tungsten disulfide (WS₂), and tungsten diselenide (WSe₂). Its high κ and moderate bandgap facilitate effective photoelectric conversion, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the resulting devices.

Performance Evaluation of Synthesized 2D Perovskite Oxide

To assess the applicability of their synthesized 2D perovskite oxide in the development of compact optoelectronics, the researchers integrated it with numerous channel materials like MoS₂ and WS₂ before evaluating the performance of the resultant transistors. Impressive results included an on/off ratio of 10⁶ in molybdenum disulfide transistors operating at a low supply voltage of 2 V and a subthreshold swing of 88 mV dec⁻¹. Furthermore, tungsten disulfide phototransistors demonstrated a photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio of approximately 10⁶ and outstanding ultraviolet (UV) responsivity of 5.5 × 10³ A W⁻¹ under both visible and UV light illumination.

Promising Outcomes and Future Prospects

The preliminary outcomes reported by this group of researchers indicate successful integration of their perovskite oxide with various channel materials through a facile method. Additionally, the well-defined interface between the semiconductor and dielectric, coupled with the high-κ of Sr₂Nb₃O₁₀, enables efficient gate control of channel materials. Consequently, phototransistors equipped with this photoactive dielectric material can achieve UV-visible dual-band photodetection—distinguishing UV and visible light illumination at distinct terminals.

Li, Liu, and their collaborators believe that their groundbreaking work will catalyze further exploration into the synthesis of additional 2D perovskite oxides capable of being integrated with existing semiconductors and channel materials. Such advancements would contribute significantly to creating smaller, high-performing, and energy-efficient electronic and optoelectronic systems.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/using-a-2d-perovskite.jpg,2024-04-01 06:30:01,"Discover High-κ 2D Perovskite Oxide for Energy-Efficient Optoelectronics!

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making waves in various industries, including stock investing. The prospect of AI revolutionizing stock picking is intriguing, but the current technology may not be up to the task. This article aims to provide an objective evaluation of AI's readiness to handle stock picking by examining the performance of AI models in answering a fundamental question: What is the most expensive tech stock?

The Limitations of Current AI in Stock Valuation

To test the proficiency of AI in stock valuation, we presented several AI models available in OpenAI's GPT marketplace with a straightforward question: What is the most expensive tech stock? The results were less than impressive. Most of the AI models, including the much-touted ChatGPT, failed to grasp the essence of the question, instead focusing on the highest stock prices in absolute terms.

Stock valuation is not about the nominal price of a stock but rather its price relative to some financial metric, such as earnings per share (EPS). The most common valuation metric is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is calculated by dividing the market value per share by the EPS. A high P/E ratio could indicate that a stock is overpriced, but it could also mean that the market expects high growth for the company.

The AI models' inability to comprehend this basic concept is concerning. It suggests that these models are drawing from a limited or misleading dataset, which may not adequately cover fundamental financial concepts. Furthermore, it implies that these models are not being fine-tuned to understand industry-specific language and concepts, such as stock valuation.

The Implications for AI in Stock Picking

The failure of AI models to grasp a basic concept like stock valuation has significant implications for the use of AI in stock picking. If AI models cannot answer a simple question about stock valuation, they are unlikely to provide valuable insights for investment decisions.

Moreover, the uniformity of the AI models' responses suggests a systemic issue in their training data. This raises questions about the reliability and validity of these models in handling more complex investment scenarios.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/linkedin-is-testing-a-tiktok-like-feed-for-short-form-videos/,LinkedIn is testing a TikTok-like feed for short-form videos, LinkedIn tests TikTok-like short-form video feature ,"LinkedIn, the professional social media network, is testing a new feature that adds short-form videos to the site. This feature allows users to quickly scroll through short videos that are housed in a new tab at the top of the navigation bar. This feature is still in its early stages of development and most users do not have access to it yet.

LinkedIn's short-form video feature is a response to the growing popularity of video content on social media platforms, such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook and Instagram Reels. This feature is designed to be engaging and to help users quickly find and consume short-form videos on the platform.

The new feature is a departure from LinkedIn's previous video feature, called Stories, which was killed in August 2021. At the time, LinkedIn stated that it wanted to move to ""a reimagined video experience that's even richer and more conversational.""

The content on LinkedIn's short-form video feature will be curated, but the details of the curation process are still unclear. The company has not officially announced the feature yet, so it is not yet clear when a wider rollout will be available.

Overall, LinkedIn's new short-form video feature is an exciting development for the platform and is likely to be popular with users who enjoy consuming video content on social media. As with any new feature, it will be interesting to see how it evolves and how it is received by users.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9a779fa5377ff276b245770deaa45c448d3e963d/2024/04/01/8160075a-0736-421b-9cdc-70c6753c00ea/linkedin-video-screensot.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,Discover LinkedIn's new short-form video feature.

The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) has finally forced the tech giant to open up its ecosystem to new rivals, and we're beginning to see what an app store environment could look like when developers are allowed to compete.
One such developer is Riley Testut, who has created an alternative app store called the AltStore. This app store will utilize the APIs and frameworks introduced by the DMA to allow developers to distribute apps independently of the App Store, and it's already begun offering a selection of apps to users in the EU.
The AltStore's business model differs from Apple's in-app subscriptions in that it allows developers to use Patreon integration to market their apps directly to consumers. This means that developers can monetize their apps without relying on ads, paid downloads, or in-app purchases.
In addition to offering a new way to monetize apps, the AltStore provides users with a ""granular view"" of the entitlements that an app has before they install it. This means that users have more control over what apps are installed on their devices, which can help to address some of the security concerns associated with sideloading apps.
While the AltStore is still in its early stages, it's already shown promise as a viable alternative to Apple's dominant app store. It's likely that we'll see more alternative app stores emerge in the coming years, as the DMA continues to force Apple to open up its ecosystem to competition.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/altstore.png?resize=1200,490",2024-04-01 16:54:25,"Patreon-backed AltStore offers app store rivalry, allows developers to monetize their apps without relying on ads or in-app purchases.

Back in March 2020, a dramatic event unfolded at Alaska's Pacific Spaceport Complex involving Astra's Rocket 3.0. An ""anomaly"" – a term used in the industry to refer to any unexpected occurrence – resulted in a fiery explosion prior to the anticipated launch. This incident marked Astra's third attempted orbital launch, yet unfortunately, the vehicle didn't make it past the launchpad.

When the incident happened, Astra remained composed amidst the setback. Having recently emerged from stealth mode, the company held a strong belief in their ability to manufacture rockets rapidly and affordably, accepting a level of failure as part of their strategy. As Astra's CEO, Chris Kemp, stated in a May 2022 interview, ""what Astra has to do...is have so many launches that nobody thinks about it anymore."" At the time, the ultimate objective wasn't centered around achieving 100% reliability.

Despite experiencing several hiccups along the way, including the 2020 mishap, Astra managed to secure orbit successfully in both November 2021 and March 2022. However, investor enthusiasm began to wane due to unmet expectations regarding cost reduction and escalating financial losses. Ultimately, these challenges led to Astra being acquired through a quiet take-private agreement between Kemp, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Adam London, and the board. This decision came at a stock price of merely $0.50 per share, far below its peak evaluation. Once the transaction concludes later this quarter, Astra will stop trading on the Nasdaq.

Throughout this journey, Astra showcased resilience and adaptability in overcoming adversities, even if initial objectives weren't fully realized. Although they fell short of revolutionizing the space industry with ultra-low-cost launch plans, valuable lessons were undoubtedly learned, paving the path towards future innovations in the field.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Astra-rocket-explosion-social.png?w=1200,2024-04-01 21:16:34,"Meta Description:
