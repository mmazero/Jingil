Introduction

In July 2021, the world bid farewell to Professor Peter Ware Higgs, the renowned British physicist who proposed the existence of the elusive Higgs boson particle – popularly dubbed the 'God Particle.' At 94, Prof. Higgs left behind an indelible mark on the realm of science before passing away due to complications arising from a blood disorder. In this tribute, we delve deeper into the life, works, and legacy of the man responsible for advancing our understanding of the fundamental forces governing the Universe.

A Groundbreaking Theory

Professor Higgs' revolutionary idea emerged during the early 1960s while attempting to address a seemingly simple question: Why do certain elementary particles possess mass? To answer this conundrum, he postulated the presence of an invisible energy field—now famously christened the Higgs field—that permeates the cosmos. According to his hypothesis, subatomic particles interact with this field via its associated carrier particle—the enigmatic Higgs boson—acquiring varying degrees of mass based on their level of engagement with this field.

Despite being initially met with skepticism, Higgs eventually succeeded in publishing his groundbreaking paper in Physical Review Letters in 1964 alongside fellow scientists Robert Brout, François Englert, Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble. However, the journey towards validating the existence of the eponymous particle remained far from over.

From Conjecture to Reality

It wasn't until 2012 that researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) managed to detect traces of the elusive Higgs boson using the colossal Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland. Following four intensive years of experimentation, the monumental breakthrough confirmed the veracity of Higgs' initial proposition, solidifying his position among the pantheons of physics legends. Moreover, the successful detection of the Higgs boson provided crucial insights into the underpinnings of the Standard Model, thereby propelling our comprehension of particle physics further than ever before.

Delving Deeper: Beyond the Higgs Boson

While the discovery of the Higgs boson marked a significant milestone in contemporary physics, experts believe that this tantalizing morsel merely scratches the surface of potential revelations waiting to be unearthed. Modern theoretical physicists posit the existence of up to five distinct Higgs boson variants, each playing a unique role in filling out what is presently termed the Higgs field. As speculation mounts regarding these hypothetical particles, many researchers harbor hopes that future investigations will shed light on the yet unproven phenomenon of dark matter.

Recognition & Legacy

For his pioneering contributions, Professor Higgs received numerous accolades throughout his illustrious career, most notably sharing the prestigious Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 with François Englert. Their citation underscored the significance of the duo's work: ""[for] the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles."" Furthermore, Queen Elizabeth II bestowed upon him the coveted title Knight Bachelor in her Birthday Honours list in 1983.

Beyond professional achievements, Sir Peter Higgs led a fulfilling personal life, leaving behind two sons, Chris and Jonny, along with their respective partners and offspring. Alas, his beloved spouse Jody, a distinguished linguistics professor, predeceased him in 2008. Despite having retired from academia several decades prior, Higgs continued to engage enthusiastically with students and colleagues alike, captivating audiences through public talks and lectures well into his twilight years.

Conclusion

With the departure of Sir Peter Higgs, humanity loses not only a brilliant mind but also a humble servant dedicated to pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. While his iconic contribution to particle physics undoubtedly forms part of his enduring legacy, let us also remember him fondly as an extraordinary individual who embraced both triumphs and tribulations with grace, dignity, and characteristic modesty. Indeed, the spirit of curiosity and intellectual rigor embodied by Sir Peter shall continue inspiring generations of aspiring physicists long after his earthly sojourn.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/svY9drAKzasCyfHZdZUofA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/2f65b080-f74d-11ee-af2f-9c94e309736d,2024-04-10 15:36:36,Get Financially Empowered with PayJoy: Access Interest-Free Loans Using Your Smartphone as Collateral - Over $300M Annualized Run Rate Achieved!, $300M ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

Venture capitalism is often associated with significant risks and rewards, yet one persistent issue remains for investors – a scarcity of liquidity. Despite backing successful startups or venture funds that appreciate in value, exiting these investments can prove challenging without initial public offerings (IPOs). This is because shares of privately held companies aren't as easily tradable as publicly listed ones. To address this concern, Cendana Capital, a fund of funds investing in numerous seed-stage venture firms, along with Kline Hill Partners, a firm dealing in smaller, pre-owned private assets, introduced a new collaboration called the Kline Hill Cendana Partners fund. Combining their areas of expertise, these entities aim to purchase stakes in seed venture funds from Limited Partners seeking to offload them, offering a potentially lucrative chance to acquire interests at reduced prices.

A Fresh Perspective on Seed Fund Investments

In recent times, several early-stage startups encountered inflated valuations amidst the funding frenzy culminating in 2021. Consequently, some startup shares might currently hold lower values compared to previous assessments. Accordingly, acquiring stakes in seed-stage VC funds and related startups offers a distinct and appealing prospect to secure relative bargains.

With combined resources amounting to $105 million—surpassing their initial goal of $75 million—the partnership focuses on purchasing stakes from Limited Partners in seed funds. Several established secondary players tend to overlook this opportunity due to its relatively diminutive scale; however, both Cendana Capital and Kline Hill Partners recognize its potential benefits.

Leveraging Unique Strengths

This strategic alliance leverages each party's comparative advantages. Cendana Capital maintains robust connections with various portfolio funds, including prominent names like Lerer Hippeau, Forerunner Ventures, and Bowery Capital. These ties facilitate primary deal sourcing for the newly formed entity. Meanwhile, Kline Hill Partners contributes essential skills in evaluating, underwriting, and determining transaction prices. By combining efforts, the duo effectively handles tasks demanding specialized knowledge beyond the capabilities of their respective investors.

Moreover, the collaborative approach enables smoother execution of otherwise difficult deals. ""Getting transactions completed that could present challenges independently"" represents a key advantage highlighted by Chris Bull, Managing Director at Kline Hill Partners. Both parties anticipate deploying the entirety of the $105 million fund by the end of 2024, setting the stage for future endeavors depending on performance outcomes.

Capitalizing on Market Trends

Large traditional secondary investors, such as Lexington Partners and Blackstone, recently secured record-breaking funds aimed at diverse private assets. Although portions of these funds cater to various sectors, industry experts expect allocations toward venture capital to materialize. Separately, Industry Ventures amassed a nearly $1.5 billion fund solely designated for secondhand VC. However, mega-funds typically prioritize bigger, multi-stage enterprises rather than focusing on seed stages. Hence, the Cendana Capital–Kline Hill Partners team identified a gap in addressing seed-stage ventures, thereby distinguishing themselves within the competitive landscape.

Conclusion

As venture-backed businesses remain private for extended durations surpassing their investors' typical 10-year fund lifecycles, the demand for liquidity alternatives continues to escalate. Through their innovative collaboration, Cendana Capital and Kline Hill Partners seek to unlock untapped potential in secondary asset purchases while providing attractive exit strategies for Limited Partners. Time will tell how successfully they navigate this emerging niche and generate compelling returns for their stakeholders.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-698155326.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-04-11 16:00:51,"Meta Description: Discover how Cendana Capital & Kline Hill Partners' new $105M fund buys seed VC fund stakes from LPs, providing unique opportunities in secondary assets.

Reminiscent of Tetris pieces, these pixels assume diverse geometric forms, including squares, S, J, and T shapes. Surprisingly, the S-shaped formation emerged as the front-runner, providing directional estimates within approximately 1-degree margins, surpassing even the square configuration. Such impressive performance stemmed primarily from strategically inserting insulating materials, such as lead sheets, among pixels. Doing so enhanced distinctions between radiation signatures arriving from disparate directions, effectively mimicking the functionality of sophisticated shadow masks embedded in traditional arrays.

Engineering Simplification & Versatility

Beyond reducing complexity and expense, the diminutive scale of these novel detectors offers additional advantages. Compact arrays enable easier maneuverability for mobile applications, facilitating rapid scanning of extensive areas compared to bulkier alternatives. Furthermore, the modular nature of this Tetris-inspired architecture permits scalable customization tailored to specific requirements. Users may augment pixel numbers or experiment with alternative geometries to boost sensitivity and spatial resolution. Consequently, these nimble devices cater well not only to standard point-source detection tasks but excel in discerning extended or multipoint emissions.

Conclusion

This concise yet informative SEO title highlights the main point of the article - researchers have discovered a way to control thermal conductivity using electric fields, paving the way for more efficient electronic devices.","Title: Harnessing Electric Fields to Control Thermal Conductivity: A Breakthrough for More Efficient Electronic Devices

Introduction

Have you ever wondered why your phone gets hot after prolonged use? Or perhaps you've experienced a significant drop in your laptop's performance due to overheating? These common issues stem from poor thermal management in electronic devices, which affects their efficiency and lifespan. However, recent breakthrough research led by Rafael Ramos and Francisco Rivadulla at the Center for Research in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Materials (CiQUS) could change all of this. Their groundbreaking discovery involves using electric fields to manipulate thermal conductivity in materials, opening up possibilities for designing advanced thermal regulators and energy-efficient technologies.

Understanding the Problem: Heat Dissipation in Electronics

Electronic devices rely on materials with inherent resistance to heat flow. When these materials obstruct the natural flow of heat generated during operation, they cause unwanted increases in temperature. As a result, the overall performance of the device declines, ultimately reducing its longevity. To address this challenge, scientists have focused on developing novel functional materials capable of adjusting their thermal conductivity depending on external conditions.

A Solution: Oxygen Ion Movement Under Electric Fields

One promising avenue of investigation revolves around memristors – unique components exhibiting resistive switching behavior under an applied electric field. Specifically, these materials can switch back and forth between distinct electrical resistance states. Intriguingly, the latest research reveals that aside from electrical resistive switching, a concurrent thermal resistive switching effect emerges at the metal-oxide interface of memristor devices. This phenomenon arises from the presence of oxygen ions and can be fine-tuned by approximately 20% at ambient temperatures.

How Does It Work?

According to Víctor Álvarez, a doctoral candidate at CiQUS and the primary author of the study, ""Oxides exhibit thermal resistance particularly susceptible to variations in oxygen concentration. By triggering a shift in oxygen ions upon applying an electric field, we effectively modify their thermal characteristics."" Essentially, the team successfully demonstrated that alterations in thermal conductivity, either increasing or decreasing, could be attained reversibly via an electric field, contingent on the resistive state of the device.

Implications and Future Directions

These exciting results form part of the larger MEMTHERM project, aimed at creating innovative thermoregulators hinging on controlling ion mobility within dielectric oxides. With further exploration and optimization, this technology holds immense potential to revolutionize how future electronics manage heat, leading to enhanced sustainability and long-term performance improvements.

Conclusion

As our reliance on portable digital devices continues to grow exponentially, finding effective strategies for managing heat generation becomes increasingly crucial.

AI Chatbots Exhibit Human Biases, Study Finds

A University of Delaware study reveals AI-generated content often has higher bias levels than reputable news sources, particularly against minorities. The research emphasizes the need for debiasing AI models as they revolutionize content creation.

","

The Pursuit of Unbiased AI: A Critical Analysis

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest for impartiality is as complex as it is crucial. Recent studies, such as one conducted by the University of Delaware and published in Scientific Reports, have shed light on the inherent biases present in AI-generated content (AIGC). This research is pivotal as it underscores the challenges and potential risks associated with AI's evolving capabilities.

The study utilized a novel framework to evaluate bias at multiple levels—word, sentence, and document—by comparing AIGC to content from established news sources like The New York Times and Reuters. The findings were stark, revealing that AI often produced content with significantly higher bias levels, particularly against minority groups.

The researchers, including Xiao Fang and Ming Zhao of the University of Delaware, embarked on this investigation following the surge in popularity of AI models like ChatGPT. Their goal was to understand whether these models could inadvertently or intentionally propagate bias. The results confirmed their concerns: AI did exhibit bias, and it was not subtle.

One of the most telling aspects of the study was the comparison of AI-generated articles with those from reputable news outlets. Despite starting with identical headlines, the AI versions displayed a tendency to focus more on majority groups, often at the expense of minorities. This was quantified not just by analyzing word choice but also by examining the overall sentiment of the content, which was found to be more negative.

The implications of these findings are far-reaching. They suggest that while AI has the potential to revolutionize content creation, it also harbors the risk of amplifying societal biases. This is particularly troubling when considering the ease with which AI can generate discriminatory content when prompted to do so.

Introduction

In recent news, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has taken urgent measures following revelations of a sophisticated cyberattack targeting multiple federal agencies. This article will delve into the details of these attacks, their impact, and the subsequent actions taken by involved parties.

The Confirmed Attack and Hacking Group

US Federal agencies have fallen victim to a series of cyberattacks conducted by a Russian government-backed hacking group named ""Midnight Blizzard"" (also known as APT29). These assaults resulted in the theft of federal government emails through compromised Microsoft corporate email accounts. According to CISA, Midnight Blizzard's success in infiltrating Microsoft's corporate email system and stealing correspondences poses a significant threat to affected agencies.

New Emergency Directives and Agency Actions

Based on escalating concerns surrounding the increased rate of intrusions by the Russian hackers, CISA released an emergency directive on April 2. This mandate ordered all civilian government agencies to promptly address potential vulnerabilities in their email accounts. Although CISA didn't reveal the names of the affected agencies, it became evident that numerous federal entities suffered from stolen emails. After providing a week for affected federal agencies to update passwords and secure systems, CISA finally released details regarding the emergency directive publicly.

Microsoft Under Scrutiny and Ongoing Remediation Efforts

As the primary provider of email hosting services for the US government, Microsoft faces growing criticism over its security practices due to a surge in attacks by nation-state backed hackers. Since the initial discovery in January, Microsoft acknowledged that the Russian hacking group gained unauthorized entry to certain corporate email systems, including those belonging to senior leaders and cybersecurity personnel. By March, the tech titan continued its attempts to remove the Russian hackers from its infrastructure during an 'ongoing attack.'

Concluding Investigations and Previous Breaches

Previously, the US Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) investigated another major breach affecting U.S. government emails traced back to Chinese government-backed hackers in 2023. The CSRB determined that a cascade of security oversights at Microsoft led to the catastrophic incident where hackers accessed a sensitive email encryption key used extensively across both consumer and government emails.

Additionally, in early 2023, around 20,000 individuals received notifications from the US Department of Defense concerning the exposure of their personal information. An unprotected Microsoft hosted cloud email server remained accessible online sans proper authentication for several weeks.

Conclusion

These incidents highlight the critical need for enhanced vigilance in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses against increasingly complex threats. As global digital connections deepen, ensuring comprehensive protection of valuable data becomes paramount for international cooperation and individual privacy alike.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1238523482-russia.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-11 19:02:00,"Meta Description:

Craig Blair, a co-founder and partner at Airtree, explained that the firm's primary goal is to maximize returns for its investors, much like other venture firms. However, Airtree's unique approach involves generating returns throughout the entire investment lifecycle, rather than just at the exit. Blair emphasized the importance of considering the exit process from the beginning, alongside the funding process.

Airtree focuses on pre-seed and seed-stage investments, and as companies increasingly remain private for extended periods, traditional fund liquidity events have become less frequent. In response, Airtree began exploring alternative methods for obtaining liquidity for its earliest stakes in 2021.

One notable example of Airtree's strategy is its involvement with Canva. Airtree initially invested in Canva's $6 million Series A round in 2015. In 2021, when Canva was valued at $39 billion, Airtree sold a portion of its stake, securing a 1.4x return on Fund I and maintaining the majority of its original stake. Blair stated that the firm doesn't follow a strict rule for determining when to sell; instead, they weigh the potential future value of the company against the value of immediate liquidity and its impact on the fund.

Airtree's strategy prioritizes maintaining a majority stake in its portfolio companies, ensuring that the firm remains positioned for a significant win while avoiding over-concentration in a single exit.

The Dawn of Ai Pin: A Glimpse into the Future of AI-Integrated Devices

In the heart of Silicon Valley, a new player in the tech arena, Humane, has emerged with a groundbreaking product that promises to redefine our interaction with technology. The Ai Pin, a sleek and innovative device, marks the company's debut in the competitive world of artificial intelligence (AI) gadgets.

Founded in 2017 by visionaries Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, who previously contributed their expertise to Apple, Humane has since secured a substantial $230 million in funding. Their mission? To craft standalone AI devices that stand out in both design and functionality.

The Ai Pin is more than just a gadget; it's a statement. It encapsulates Humane's ambition to spearhead a series of devices that leverage the burgeoning field of generative AI. Drawing from the strengths of various Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, including the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, the Ai Pin is engineered to excel at each task it undertakes.

During an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Bongiorno and Chaudhri shared insights into Humane's journey and its strategic roadmap. The Ai Pin, while a first-generation offering, showcases meticulous craftsmanship—a testament to the founders' Apple lineage. Despite some initial teething issues with reliability and functionality, the device's design reflects a profound attention to detail.

Humane envisions the Ai Pin as a harbinger of a new era in technology, one that transcends the constraints of traditional devices. Priced at $699, the Ai Pin is a voice-operated, perpetually connected companion that encourages users to occasionally disconnect from their smartphone screens and engage with the world around them.

Bongiorno recounted a pivotal moment that inspired the creation of the Ai Pin. A family engrossed in their phones at a dinner sparked a dialogue about technology's role in our lives—the benefits and the unintended consequences. This observation fueled the development of a device designed to balance connectivity with real-world presence.

The Ai Pin arrives amidst a generative AI renaissance. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Rabbit captured attention with its R1 handheld, and shortly after, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), Brain.AI unveiled a handset centered around generative AI. These developments signify a vibrant and varied landscape, even as the broader smartphone market faces challenges.

Humane's offering includes the Ai Pin, an additional battery, and an AI charging case, with color variants beginning at $799. A range of accessories is also available, priced between $29 and $49. To complement the hardware, a subscription service is offered at $24 per month. In a gesture of goodwill, Humane provides three months of service free with every Ai Pin purchase.

As we stand on the cusp of this technological revolution, the Ai Pin represents not just a product but a portal to a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, enhancing our experiences without overshadowing our humanity.

Introduction
In today's digital age, protecting our personal information has become increasingly important. With numerous data breaches occurring frequently, one search engine giant, DuckDuckGo, has taken significant strides towards ensuring its users' privacy. By introducing Privacy Pro, a suite of innovative tools centered around maintaining online security, DuckDuckGo aims to prevent data brokers from gaining access to sensitive user information. In this article, we delve deeper into the features and benefits offered by DuckDuckGo's latest offering while highlighting how it stands out among competitors.

Privacy Pro: An Overview
Privacy Pro is a comprehensive solution comprising three distinct components—anonymous VPN, personal information removal, and identity theft restoration services. These offerings mark the first of their kind as they do not require users to share any personal information, thereby enhancing overall privacy protection. However, due to encryption storage limitations, the current iteration of Privacy Pro does not support mobile compatibility; nonetheless, DuckDuckGo assures us that they are actively addressing this issue.

Anonymous VPN
DuckDuckGo's VPN ensures that users' web activities remain private by refraining from logging any VPN-related actions. Since there is no connection between individuals using the platform and the resulting VPN usage, tracing activity back to a particular person becomes virtually impossible. Thus, DuckDuckGo successfully eliminates potential vulnerabilities associated with traditional VPN log keeping practices.

Personal Information Removal Service
Following its acquisition of data removal service Removaly in 2022, DuckDuckGo integrated these capabilities into Privacy Pro. Users store their information locally instead of uploading it onto servers. As such, removal requests originate solely from each device without transmitting any data externally. Additionally, periodic site scans ensure that removed information remains absent, effectively breaking ties with unwanted data collectors.

Identity Theft Restoration Services
Unlike typical prevention measures, DuckDuckGo's identity theft restoration component initiates assistance upon detecting suspicious behavior related to stolen identities. Notably, users need not disclose any identifying details during registration, further bolstering trust and transparency. Should account takeovers occur, affected parties receive expert guidance through recovery processes, loss mitigation strategies, and necessary credit report corrections.

Secure Payment Processing & Availability
To facilitate transactions seamlessly, DuckDuckGo partners with trusted third-party platforms like Stripe, Google Play, and the Apple App Store. No financial records reside on DuckDuckGo servers, reinforcing their commitment to preserving user privacy. Subscriptions start at just $9.99 per month or $99.99 annually, presently accessible exclusively to U.S.-based clients. Future plans include expanding availability across various global markets.

Conclusion
As cybersecurity threats continue evolving, so too must our protective measures. Through the launch of Privacy Pro, DuckDuckGo demonstrates foresight and dedication toward defending users against invasive data collection tactics commonly employed by online entities. Offering anonymized VPN functionality, proactive personal information removal services, and responsive identity theft restoration capabilities, Privacy Pro cements itself as a formidable contender amidst burgeoning privacy concerns.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9f3943f23f8fc5cf2e0ce4f2bb1b5431c457db11/2024/04/11/dd9f047d-04c1-4f8c-b57a-2ddffe675568/duckduckgo.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-11 00:00:00,"Meta Description (under 15 words): Protect your privacy with DuckDuckGo's all-in-one solution - anonymous VPN, info removal, ID theft restore!

Introduction

In today's digital age, companies often face the daunting challenge of managing data security incidents. One crucial aspect of addressing these situations is communicating effectively with affected customers. Recently, AT&T, one of the United States' largest wireless service providers, found itself in this predicament when it had to inform over 70 million customers about a data leak. This article will discuss the importance of staggering customer notification during data breaches and highlight lessons learned from the recent AT&T incident.

Staggering Customer Communication During Data Breaches

When dealing with significant customer databases, sending mass notifications all at once might seem like the most efficient approach. However, there are compelling reasons why organizations should consider staging their communications over several days instead:

1. Reducing system burden: High volumes of simultaneous requests can overwhelm websites and servers, leading to crashes or poor performance. By spreading out the notifications, companies can help prevent such issues.
2. Improving customer experience: Receiving timely, personalized messages allows customers to address potential threats promptly without feeling overwhelmed by a sudden influx of information.
3. Managing resources efficiently: Staggered notifications enable organizations to allocate support staff and resources more evenly across the notification period, ensuring better assistance throughout the process.

AT&T's Recent Data Leak Incident

On April 11, AT&T notified over 70 million customers about a data leak initially disclosed on March 30. Although the company claimed to send communications in stages, initial evidence suggested otherwise—causing significant inconvenience to users trying to access Experian'sIdentityWorks service for complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection.

Server Overload and Performance Issues

As soon as AT&T directed its customers to Experian's website, numerous technical problems ensued. Users reported sluggish server responses,HTTP 500 errors, and malfunctioningSMS credentials through Experian's mobile app. These challenges made it difficult for consumers to take advantage of the offered benefits and raised concerns about the adequacy of AT&T's crisis management strategy.

Lessons Learned and Best Practices

AT&T's recent experience offers valuable insights for other organizations facing similar challenges:

1. Honesty and transparency: Companies must acknowledge mistakes openly and maintain consistent communication with customers. Informing clients about the issue early on helps establish trust and mitigate reputational damage.
2. Clear guidance and easy steps: Providing simple and actionable advice enables customers to protect themselves quickly and reduces confusion. Offering detailed yet digestible information fosters confidence in your organization's ability to manage the situation responsibly.
3. Prioritizing infrastructure preparedness: Ensuring that partner systems can handle increased traffic loads is essential before initiating mass communications. Testing and reinforcing network capacity prevents bottlenecks and improves overall user experiences.
4. Staggering notifications: Distributing alerts over several days significantly eases pressure on servers while providing a smoother experience for end-users. It also ensures that organizations can monitor progress and adjust strategies accordingly.

Conclusion

Effectively managing data breaches requires careful planning, open communication, and resource allocation. As demonstrated by AT&T's recent experience, staggering customer notifications plays a critical role in preventing system overloads and enhancing user experiences during challenging times. Adopting best practices in crisis management enables organizations to build stronger relationships with their clientele while maintaining business continuity and reputation integrity.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/f5d5fde142d47b4b6198d9361c82225f5553865f/2024/04/11/fcd1fa98-e548-4a44-8bbe-7ff255f0fbc6/gettyimages-1688829465-1.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-11 00:00:00,"""Learn from AT&T: Stagger customer notifications during data breaches.
