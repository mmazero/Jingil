Introduction

In the face of escalating energy demands and the urgent need for carbon-free power sources, small modular reactors (SMRs) have emerged as a potential solution. Despite setbacks, such as the cancellation of NuScale's project in Idaho, the nuclear industry remains optimistic about the future of SMRs. This article explores the current state of SMRs, their potential benefits, and the challenges they must overcome to become widely adopted.

The State of Small Modular Reactors

Numerous nations have shifted away from nuclear power in recent years, but SMR manufacturers are working diligently to win over skeptical customers. Although NuScale's Idaho project was abandoned due to ballooning costs, other SMR projects are making progress. For instance, GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 design is expected to commence power production in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, by 2029, pending regulatory approval.

In the United States, the Tennessee Valley Authority has invested in the BWRX-300, and TerraPower plans to start constructing a novel liquid sodium-cooled fast reactor in Wyoming in June 2024. Meanwhile, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation has chosen Gadsden, Alabama, for its Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) assembly plant, with operations slated to begin in 2027.

Challenges and Opportunities

One of the primary challenges facing SMRs is managing costs. While some expense increases are due to broader economic factors, such as higher commodity prices, the nuclear industry must address its unique challenges. TerraPower, for example, aims to reduce labor and material costs with its novel reactor technology.

Standardization is another critical factor in reducing costs. By replicating successful designs across multiple projects, the industry can streamline the construction process and lower expenses. This approach is already being adopted by companies like TerraPower and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation.

Regulatory hurdles are another challenge SMRs must overcome. In the United States, the House of Representatives approved a bill in late February 2024 to expedite the licensing of advanced nuclear power.

Introduction

Have you ever wondered how the prompts you use when interacting with large language models (LLMs) can affect the responses you receive? A team of researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) decided to explore this question, focusing on the reliability of LLM responses to variations in prompts. Their findings, published on the preprint server arXiv, reveal that even subtle changes in prompts can significantly influence LLM predictions.

The Four Categories of Prompt Variations

The researchers examined four categories of prompt variations:

1. Output formats: The team investigated the impact of requesting responses in specific output formats commonly used in data processing, such as lists and CSV files.
2. Perturbations: They analyzed minor modifications to the prompt itself, such as adding extra spaces at the beginning or end, or incorporating polite phrases like ""Thank you"" or ""Howdy!"".
3. Jailbreaks: These are techniques used to bypass content filters when dealing with sensitive topics. The researchers explored the use of jailbreaks, asking the LLM to answer as if it was assuming a certain role or character.
4. Incentives: Inspired by the idea that offering a tip could yield better responses, they tested different amounts of tips for ""a perfect response.""

Testing the Prompt Variations

The researchers tested the prompt variations across 11 benchmark text classification tasks, which typically involve categorizing or assigning labels to text data based on their content or meaning. These tasks included toxicity classification, grammar evaluation, humor and sarcasm detection, and mathematical proficiency assessments.

Key Findings

The research uncovered several interesting insights:

1. Output formats: By simply adding a specified output format, the researchers observed a minimum of 10% of predictions changed.
2. Perturbations: Minor prompt modifications resulted in a smaller number of changes compared to output format variations, but still led to a significant number of prediction changes. For example, introducing a space at the beginning or end of a prompt led to over 500 changes (out of 11,000) in predictions.
3. Jailbreaks: Using jailbreaks resulted in a larger proportion of changes, with the effect being highly dependent on the specific jail",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/chatgpt-1.jpg,2024-04-08 13:20:02,"Meta Description: Uncover the power of prompts in shaping ChatGPT responses!

Climbing robots have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from maintenance and inspection of high-altitude structures to parcel delivery in hard-to-reach areas. To effectively perform these tasks, these robots must accurately sense and map their surroundings while maintaining precise knowledge of their location. Researchers from Guangdong University of Technology have recently proposed a novel method to improve a bipedal climbing robot's ability to estimate its state and map its environment, specifically when navigating truss structures.

A truss is a triangular system composed of interconnected straight elements, which can be found in bridges, roofs, or other man-made structures. The researchers' proposed method, introduced in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, employs a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm tailored to a bipedal climbing robot (BiCR).

Biped Climbing Robot (BiCR)

The BiCR, developed by the Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab, is an electromechanical system akin to a moving manipulator, capable of moving via grippers at both ends and rotating with multiple joints. This robot can be utilized for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and hazardous environments, such as construction site scaffolding and power towers.

SLAM for BiCR

The primary objective of the study was to enable a bipedal climbing robot to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures. The researchers developed BiCR-SLAM, a SLAM-based system specifically for the BiCR robot, which uses information about the robot's configuration, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras to localize the robot and map the truss it is climbing.

BiCR-SLAM consists of four components: encoder dead reckoning, LiDAR odometry estimation, pole landmark mapping, and a global optimization technique. The global optimization proposes a multi-source fusion factor graph to jointly optimize the robot localization and pole landmarks.

A key advantage of BiCR-SLAM is its ability to simultaneously consider information related to the bipedal robot's joints",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-fusion-slam-system-t-1.jpg,2024-04-08 07:50:01,"Meta Description:

Nonlinear systems are ubiquitous, appearing in various fields, from robotics to economics. However, their inherent complexity makes mathematical modeling and control challenging. To tackle this issue, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system has emerged as a powerful tool, approximating nonlinear systems as multiple linear systems using fuzzy logic. In recent years, the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS), an enhanced version of the T–S fuzzy system, has gained traction by combining fuzzy logic with space-state representation.

Despite extensive research, optimal control strategies for T–S FDSs remain largely unexplored, with robust control methods introducing additional complexity and optimization challenges. To address these limitations, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from Shibaura Institute of Technology and including Thi-Van-Anh Nguyen, Quy-Thinh Dao, and Duc-Binh Pham from Hanoi University of Science and Technology developed novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model.

The researchers built their controllers on the Lyapunov stability theory, transforming the stability conditions into Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) for practical application. This transformation enabled the creation of three distinct controllers: a stability controller, an optimal controller, and a robust-optimal controller.

Revolutionizing Nonlinear Control with Optimal and Robust-Optimal Controllers

Nonlinear systems are prevalent across various domains, from robotics to economics. However, their inherent complexity poses challenges in mathematical modeling and control. The Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system has emerged as a powerful tool for approximating nonlinear systems as multiple linear systems using fuzzy logic. More recently, the fuzzy descriptor system (FDS), an enhanced version of the T–S fuzzy system, has gained attention by combining fuzzy logic with space-state representation.

Despite extensive research, optimal control strategies for T–S FDSs have been largely unexplored, with robust control methods introducing additional complexity and optimization challenges. To tackle these limitations, a research team led by Associate Professor Ngoc-Tam Bui from Shibaura Institute of Technology, along with Thi-Van-Anh Nguyen, Quy-Thinh Dao, and Duc-Binh Pham from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, developed novel optimal and robust-optimal controllers based on the T–S fuzzy descriptor model.

The researchers built their controllers on the Lyapunov stability theory, transforming the stability conditions into Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) for practical application. This transformation enabled the creation of three distinct controllers: a stability controller, an optimal controller, and a robust-optimal controller.

The stability controller, employing Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC), effectively manages deviations in the system. The optimal controller minimizes a cost function to achieve optimal control, while the robust-optimal controller combines the benefits of both stability and optimal control.

These innovative controllers offer significant improvements in controlling nonlinear systems, making them an essential development in the field of control theory with implications for a wide range of applications, including robotics, economics, and more.", Fuzzy Descriptor System ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Drones have revolutionized various industries, from filmmaking to search-and-rescue missions. However, their limited battery life has always been a significant obstacle. Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark have been tackling this issue, and their recent breakthrough promises an exciting future for drone technology. They've developed a drone that can inspect and charge from power lines, extending its flight time significantly.

The researchers modified a Tarot 650 Sport drone, equipping it with an electric quadcopter propulsion system, an autopilot module, and other essential components. The drone's unique feature is its gripper system, designed to latch onto power lines and recharge the device's battery.

When the drone's battery level drops, the system activates, employing a camera and millimeter-wave radar to locate the closest power line. The drone then maneuvers itself underneath the power line, using its inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into the gripper. An inductive charger draws current from the power line, recharging the battery. Once fully charged, the gripper releases the power line, and the drone resumes its flight.

Initially, the researchers envisioned drones inspecting power lines as the primary application for this charging system. In 2022, they unveiled a self-charging drone that recharged from power lines, albeit with limitations. This time, they've enhanced the gripper system and demonstrated a practical use case for the technology.

In their paper for the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the team described their achievement as ""a first-in-the-world system capable of sustaining operation throughout multiple inspection/charging cycles, powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment."" They successfully tested the drone's ability to stay aloft for over two hours, completing five cycles of power line inspection and recharging.

This development marks a significant milestone in the world of drones, as it opens up new possibilities for extended flight times. The team's next steps include refining the system for various applications, such as wildlife monitoring, shipping, and telecommunications.
