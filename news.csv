A little over a year ago, a new player entered the world of microblogging: Post News. Launched in beta, Post aimed to capitalize on the buzz surrounding Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition. However, its journey has come to an end, as founder Noam Bardin recently announced its closure.

Post News: A Bold Idea, A Sobering Reality

Post News emerged with a mission to leverage Twitter's reputation as a virtual watercooler for journalists, offering a fresh platform for publishers and writers to monetize their content. The strategy revolved around users purchasing individual articles from partner outlets instead of subscribing to various publications.

Despite early enthusiasm and backing from high-profile investors, such as Andreessen Horowitz, Scott Galloway, and Kara Swisher, Post News failed to gain sufficient traction. In a farewell post, Bardin admitted that the platform couldn't generate rapid consumer adoption, ultimately leading to its downfall.

Micropayments and Users' Willingness to Purchase Content

Although Post News didn't survive, Bardin believes that the platform validated theories around micropayments and consumers' willingness to purchase individual articles. Users could tip writers for their work, demonstrating a potential revenue model for digital news outlets.

The Changing Media Landscape and New Monetization Models

Post News' demise comes at a time when the media landscape is experiencing significant shifts. The rise of independent and worker-owned publications hosted on platforms like Substack, Beehiiv, and Ghost highlights the evolving nature of content creation and monetization.

New solar tech at UNIST & Stanford sets NH3 production record, doubling US DOE standards. Leveraging perovskites, Ru catalyst & glycerol, it provides cleaner, eco-friendlier alternatives to traditional methods.","Title: Harnessing Solar Energy for Eco-friendly Ammonia Production: A Revolutionary Step Towards a Sustainable Future

A groundbreaking technology that leverages solar energy to produce ammonia (NH3) with unprecedented efficiency has been developed by a research team from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), in collaboration with Stanford University. This new method surpasses the commercialization standard set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) by a significant 1.7 times, marking a new world record in ammonia production efficiency.

The innovative system is based on a perovskite-based photoelectrode platform for NH3 production, which functions by reducing nitrate (NO3-) in water using solar energy. This approach offers a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch process, which is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Moreover, this technology opens up opportunities for the synthesis of high-value compounds used in various industries, including fertilizers, food, and pharmaceuticals.

The key to this technology's success is the development of a highly efficient photoelectrode system that combines perovskite solar cells with a ruthenium (Ru) catalyst on titanate nanosheets (TiNS). By safeguarding the perovskite material with Field's metal and integrating it with the catalyst for NH3 production, the research team achieved unparalleled performance and durability in NH3 production.

One of the most notable aspects of this technology is the use of glycerol as a reactant in the production process. This allows for NH3 production without the need for external voltage. By optimizing the oxidation reaction of glycerol with the voltage generated by the photoelectrodes, the team demonstrated a remarkable maximum ammonia production rate of 1745 Î¼gNH3 cm-2h-1, far exceeding the DOE's commercialization standard.

According to Professor Ji-Wook Jang, ""Through this study, we have demonstrated the production of NO3-, a primary source of contamination in water, while simultaneously oxidizing glycerol, a low-value byproduct derived from biomass, to produce a higher-",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/harnessing-solar-energ.jpg,2024-04-19 08:36:23,"Transform Sunlight into Valuable NH3 & Clean Water!

Bristol research","Title: Unraveling the Aeroacoustic Mystery of Futuristic Aircraft's Embedded Engines

For years, the aviation industry has been exploring the potential of boundary layer ingesting (BLI) ducted fans, a cutting-edge technology that promises significant fuel savings by partially embedding engines into an aircraft's main body. However, a crucial challenge has remained unsolved - understanding the noise these configurations produce and how it impacts the overall aeroacoustic performance. A team of researchers from the University of Bristol has finally unveiled the physics behind the noise generated by BLI ducted fans, paving the way for quieter airframe-integrated propulsion systems in future aircraft concepts.

The Aeroacoustic Enigma

BLI ducted fans are a variation of the large engines found in modern aircraft but are partially embedded into the plane's fuselage instead of under the wings. By ingesting air from both the front and the surface of the airframe, they require less effort to move the plane, leading to reduced fuel consumption. Despite their potential benefits, one critical issue has hindered the widespread adoption of BLI ducted fans - noise.

Addressing this urgent problem, a research team led by Dr. Feroz Ahmed from Bristol's School of Civil, Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, in collaboration with Professor Mahdi Azarpeyvand, set out to investigate the noise generated by BLI ducted fans. Using the University National Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Facility, the researchers identified distinct noise sources originating from the duct, the rotating fan, and the air flowing over the curved airframe surface.

Noise Patterns and Thrust Levels

The team discovered that the noise pattern changes depending on the thrust produced by the fan. When the fan generates high thrust, the noise pattern is similar to that of fans without ducts. However, when the fan produces less thrust, the noise pattern changes because the duct itself starts making more noise. This shift in noise patterns is crucial for understanding the behavior of BLI ducted fans and developing strategies to minimize noise emission in the aviation sector.

Dr. Ahmed further explains, ""Our study addresses this urgent issue of noise, which poses a major obstacle in obtaining certifications, by uncovering the physics behind the noise these configurations produce.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/silent-flight-edges-cl.jpg,2024-04-19 10:47:31,"""Discover the physics of noise in futuristic aircraft's embedded engines: Unraveling BLI ducted fan aeroacoustics.
