Shining a Light on Mental Health: Uncovering the Potential of Near-Infrared Light Therapy

In our increasingly indoor-oriented lives, we're missing out on the sun's natural benefits, leading to a growing awareness of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While SAD affects a relatively small population, it has shed light on the sun's role in serotonin production and its impact on our well-being.

Light therapy lamps, designed to mimic the sun's effects, have gained popularity. However, a new frontier in light therapy is emerging: near-infrared (NIR) light. NIR sits between infrared and visible light, offering potential alternatives to traditional visible light therapy.

A Dutch company, Seaborough, showcased small NIR devices at MWC, designed to replace bulky SAD lamps. These compact devices connect to a computer's USB port for power, offering a more convenient and discreet solution.

While still in the proof-of-concept stage, these devices have sparked interest in the potential of NIR light therapy. Research suggests that low-level light therapy in the NIR range, known as photobiomodulation (PBM), has shown promise in various medical applications.

One study, conducted a decade ago, found that PBM treatment at a specific dosage had positive effects on well-being and health, including improved mood, reduced drowsiness, and a lower resting heart rate. However, the study noted that these benefits were only observed during the winter months and had no significant impact on circadian rhythm.

While more research is needed to fully understand the effects of NIR light therapy, it holds promise as a potential tool for improving mental well-being, especially during the darker winter months. As the technology advances, we may see NIR light therapy integrated into laptops and other devices, making it more accessible and convenient for those seeking relief from SAD and other mood-related issues.

Hey tech enthusiasts and gadget lovers of the blog world - let me introduce you to a concept that has been making waves in the smartphone industry lately – the E Color Shift technology by the Hong Kong based company called infinix

This innovative tech is all about transforming the back of your smartphone from a dull and blank canvas into an interactive and colorful display that can change colors and patterns at will

It works on a principle similar to E Ink but with a twist - by applying different electric fields to the microstructure of the back panel the corresponding color particles move and display the desired colors

The result is a dynamic and eye catching back panel that can display images even when the battery is dead or the phone is powered off

While infinix has been showing off this technology at MWC Barcelona it is still in its prototype stage and requires an external battery pack to function

The big question is will this ever make it to an actual smartphone or will it remain a novelty

Well the company is hoping that a third party will license the technology and bring it to the masses but let s be honest it s hard to imagine people buying a smartphone just for this feature alone

After all it doesn t really do much except for displaying images and patterns and it will most likely be covered by a case or your hand anyway

So while the E Color Shift technology is certainly a cool concept it s probably not going to be a game changer in the smartphone industry anytime soon

But hey who knows maybe in the future we ll see smartphones with backs that can display our favorite memes or even play simple games

Until then it s just a fun experiment that shows us the possibilities of future smartphone design

Navigating the Nuances: North American VCs in the European Startup Market

A few years ago, North American venture capitalists (VCs) flocked to Europe, eager to tap into the region's burgeoning startup scene. The Spotify IPO served as a wake-up call, highlighting Europe's potential for outsized exits. However, the journey hasn't been without its challenges.

The European startup market has grown rapidly, but it comes with unique complexities. Each country has its own language, currency, and regulatory landscape. Investing in Romania and Italy is vastly different from investing in Texas and California. Additionally, the networks for startups and universities differ from those in the U.S., making it a challenging market even in the best of times.

The rise of European VCs has further intensified competition for the best deals, especially at the early stages. Local investors often have a better understanding of the nuances of their respective markets. This has made it harder for North American VCs to gain a foothold.

Despite these challenges, North American firms continue to try to establish a presence in Europe. The regulatory landscape in the U.S. is still unclear for emerging sectors like AI and crypto, while Europe offers more clarity. This has attracted U.S.-based LPs who are eager to diversify their portfolios.

The European startup ecosystem remains largely underpenetrated, presenting opportunities for international VCs. However, firms need to develop strategies that address the unique challenges of the region to ensure their efforts bear fruit.

Key Takeaways:

- The European startup market has grown rapidly, but it comes with unique complexities.
- The rise of European VCs has intensified competition for the best deals.
- North American VCs face challenges due to language barriers, currency differences, and regulatory nuances.
- Despite the challenges, North American firms continue to try to establish a presence in Europe due to the region's regulatory clarity and growth potential.
- Firms need to develop strategies that address the unique challenges of the region to ensure their efforts pay off.

Navigating the AI Revolution: A Conversation with Amba Kak

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence (AI), it's crucial to recognize the contributions of women academics and professionals who are driving this revolution. TechCrunch's latest series shines a spotlight on remarkable women who have made significant strides in the field of AI, often facing challenges in a male-dominated industry.

Amba Kak, Executive Director of the AI Now Institute, is one such trailblazer. With a background in technology policy and law, Kak has dedicated her career to addressing AI concerns and shaping its trajectory towards serving public interests.

Q: What drew you to the field of AI?

Kak: AI, though a buzzword today, encompasses practices and systems that have been evolving for decades. My interest lies in understanding how data-driven technologies impact society and the economy. The core issues remain the same, but the terminology has changed from ""big data"" to ""AI.""

Q: What work are you most proud of in the AI field?

Kak: Our 2023 AI Landscape report, released amidst the ChatGPT-fueled AI buzz, provided a much-needed diagnosis of AI's impact on society and the economy. It challenged the narratives of AI's omniscience and inevitability, highlighting the concentration of power within a narrow section of the tech industry.

I'm also proud of my work as Senior Advisor to the Federal Trade Commission on AI, where I contributed to emerging technology issues and key enforcement actions. This experience taught me the significance of influencing policymaking even as an individual.

Q: How do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated AI industry?

Kak: The tech industry, particularly AI, remains a predominantly white, male, and geographically concentrated field. However, I believe it's essential to look beyond the ""white dude problem"" and address the structural inequalities and power imbalances embedded in the industry's operations.

The real issue lies in the concentration of power among a small group of companies and individuals who control capital, networks, and influence. This power imbalance allows them to act with impunity, despite the enormous social and economic impacts of the platforms they control.

Q: What advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field?

Kak: For women and other marginalized identities seeking to critique AI from outside the industry, it's crucial to stand your ground. The AI industry often attempts to discredit critique, especially from non-STEM backgrounds.

Despite decades of experience, powerful voices may try to undermine your valid critique simply because you challenge the status quo. Remember, you have as much say in the future of AI as anyone else. Claim your space and hold your ground.
