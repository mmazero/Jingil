https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/liquid-death-vc-beverage-startup-coke-pepsi/,Liquid Death is just one of many VC-backed beverage startups ready to disrupt Coke and Pepsi, VC-Backed Startup Liquid Death Disrupts Coke and Pepsi ,"

Venture-backed beverage startups are disrupting the beverage industry, challenging the dominance of giants like Coke and Pepsi. One such startup is Liquid Death, a canned water company that recently raised $67 million in funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion. With $263 million in sales in 2023, Liquid Death has proven its potential to investors.

The beverage industry is not a typical target for venture capitalists due to its capital-intensive nature and the need for companies to perform well on retail shelves and attract repeat customers. However, Liquid Death has managed to capture the attention of investors like Science Ventures, who recognized its disruptive brand and better-for-you product offering.

In order to stand out in the crowded beverage market, some startups are creating new drink categories. By drawing inspiration from other industries and leveraging new technologies and data, these startups are able to generate significant revenue. Liquid Death, for example, has taken cues from beer marketing and shelf placement to successfully position itself in grocery stores, events, bars, restaurants, and conferences.

The success of Liquid Death and similar brands highlights the market demand for alcohol-inspired alternatives that cater to consumers who want to drink less or choose healthier options. Not Beer, a premium sparkling water brand launching soon, is targeting this market by offering a non-alcoholic alternative that still provides a fun and enjoyable experience.

Differentiating a brand in such a competitive market is a challenge. According to Dillon Dandurand, the founder of Not Beer, taste and branding are the key attributes that consumers care about. To succeed, a brand must convince consumers that its drink is superior to others in the same category and even better than drinks in other categories.

Water is not the only category attracting startups and venture capital. Drinks infused with vitamins, minerals, supplements, and botanicals are also gaining popularity. For instance, Odyssey has raised $6 million in funding for its drinks infused with lion's mane and cordyceps mushrooms, known for their cognitive and energy-boosting effects. Other startups like Olipop, Poppi, and Lemon Perfect have also secured significant funding for their better-for-you soda and lemonade alternatives.

Poppi, in particular, has made a notable impact in the beverage market, capturing 19% of the market share since its launch four years ago. With support from investors like CAVU Consumer Partners and celebrity backers such as Russell Westbrook, Olivia Munn, and Nicole Scherzinger, Poppi has established itself as a major player in the industry.

In conclusion, venture-backed beverage startups are disrupting the traditional beverage industry by introducing innovative products and appealing to consumers' desire for healthier alternatives. Liquid Death's success and the rise of brands like Not Beer, Odyssey, Olipop, Poppi, and Lemon Perfect demonstrate the potential for growth and profitability in this space. As the industry continues to evolve, we can expect more exciting developments and new players entering the market.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing, Mallard Bay: Online Booking for Guided Hunting & Fishing ,"Americans have a deep affinity for fishing and hunting, as evidenced by the $144.8 billion spent on these activities in 2022 alone. However, the booking process for guided hunting and fishing trips has been outdated, with phone calls and physical checks being the norm. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this industry by providing an online marketplace for consumers to book these excursions, similar to booking a hotel. Furthermore, Mallard Bay offers a vertical SaaS platform for outfitters to manage their back office operations and access additional services like marketing.

In a recent announcement, Mallard Bay revealed that it has raised $4.6 million in a Series A funding round led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. The inspiration for Mallard Bay came from co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux's own disappointing hunting trip experience. When he thought he had booked a three-day guided duck hunt in Oklahoma, he and his father discovered upon arrival that the hunt had been double-booked. Their only option was to hunt for one day with 13 other people, and Meaux didn't even get a chance to shoot. This frustrating incident motivated him to create a better solution.

Initially, Mallard Bay set out to create a marketplace similar to Airbnb, where people could book guided hunts. However, after consulting with outfitters and guides, they realized that they needed to offer more to attract these professionals. This realization led to the development of Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back office solution for outfitters. While outfitters were receptive to the idea of modernizing their operations, many of them lacked the business expertise required for such a transition. Mallard Bay bridged this gap by combining their passion for the outdoors with their software expertise.

The platform gained traction when it onboarded Toby Brohlin, a hunting influencer, who has generated over $1 million in gross bookings. As a whole, Mallard Bay facilitated more than $6 million in gross bookings in 2023 and is projected to reach $30 million to $35 million in 2024. Despite these impressive numbers, Meaux faced challenges in securing investment due to investors' lack of understanding about the hunting and fishing industry. Additionally, the founders had to dispel misconceptions and assure potential backers that Mallard Bay was not promoting exotic hunting trips in Africa. They emphasized the company's commitment to ethical practices and conservation, as hunting and fishing done responsibly contribute to wildlife preservation.

While hunting and fishing may not be commonly associated with the startup and tech ecosystem, Mallard Bay's success in raising funding and achieving significant growth is noteworthy. The company's bookings have grown by an impressive 600% year over year, highlighting the potential of niche markets. Outdoor activities, including hunting and fishing, account for over $394 billion in spending in the United States. However, many aspects of these industries still rely on outdated and poorly functioning technology. As an example, the author shares their personal experience of struggling to find parking information for a popular hiking trail in Sedona, Arizona. This demonstrates the need for innovative solutions like Mallard Bay in the outdoor industry.

In conclusion, Mallard Bay is revolutionizing the hunting and fishing industry by providing an online marketplace for booking guided tours. Their platform not only benefits consumers but also offers outfitters a comprehensive back office solution. The startup's recent funding round and impressive growth reflect the untapped potential of niche markets. With Americans' significant spending on outdoor activities, it is clear that there is a demand for modernized and user-friendly platforms like Mallard Bay. By combining passion, expertise, and a commitment to ethical practices, Mallard Bay is transforming the way people experience and engage with hunting and fishing.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,"Meta Description: Revolutionize the hunting and fishing industry with Mallard Bay's online marketplace.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/why-its-impossible-to-review-ais-and-why-techcrunch-is-doing-it-anyway/,"Why it's impossible to review AIs, and why TechCrunch is doing it anyway", The Challenge of Reviewing AI Models: TechCrunch's Efforts ,"Every week, it seems like there's a new AI model being released. However, evaluating these models comprehensively has become nearly impossible due to their fast pace and constant updates. Companies like Google and OpenAI are taking advantage of this by providing their own claims without any external source of truth. Despite these challenges, it's important to try and review these AI systems to provide a real-world counterweight to industry hype.

The sheer number and diversity of AI models make it difficult for anyone except dedicated organizations to assess their merits and shortcomings. At TechCrunch, we receive news of new or updated models on a daily basis. While we do our best to keep up with them, it's overwhelming to delve into the various release levels, access requirements, and platforms. It's like trying to boil the ocean.

Fortunately, our readers are more interested in top-line models and major releases. Models like Vicuna-13B, which are primarily for research purposes, can be excluded from consideration. However, even after removing these models, there are still too many to handle.

The reason is that these large models are not simple pieces of software or hardware. They are platforms with multiple individual models and services integrated into them. For example, when you ask Gemini for directions to a good Thai restaurant, it doesn't just rely on its training set to find the answer. Instead, it queries various Google services and sub-models to provide a comprehensive response. The chat interface is just a frontend for a complex system of AI-powered and other services.

Furthermore, the AI models we review today may not be the same ones used tomorrow. Companies like Google and OpenAI make changes to their models without disclosing the details. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to know how and when these changes occur. A review of a model may become outdated if the company updates it shortly after. Additionally, these AI systems are capable of performing a wide range of tasks, even ones their creators didn't anticipate or claim. It's impossible to exhaustively test them since users constantly discover new functions and edge cases.

Moreover, these companies keep their internal training methods and databases as trade secrets. Unlike mission-critical processes that benefit from external audits, AI model development remains hidden from scrutiny. We don't know the exact methods used by OpenAI to train ChatGPT or why Google's image model included 18th-century slave owners. While companies may offer vague explanations, they will never fully disclose their practices.

Despite these challenges, AI models can still be evaluated. However, it's not a straightforward process. Imagine an AI model as a baseball player. While they may possess various talents and skills, what matters most is their ability to hit, field, and run. Similarly, AI models can do many things, but only a handful are relevant to the majority of users. It's important to focus on evaluating the capabilities that millions of people will likely use regularly.

In conclusion, evaluating AI models has become increasingly difficult due to their rapid pace of development and lack of transparency from companies. However, it's crucial to review these systems to provide a realistic perspective amidst industry hype. While challenges exist, it's still possible to assess the key functionalities that are relevant to users. By doing so, we can contribute to a more informed understanding of AI technologies.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-robot-phrenology-v4.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 13:01:15,Meta Description: Discover the challenges of evaluating AI models in an ever-changing landscape.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises"," Apple Antitrust Lawsuit, Microsoft's AI Ambitions, and Nvidia's Surprises ","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates in the tech industry. In this week's edition, we have some big news on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that the company's practices could harm competition and limit consumer choice. Apple, on the other hand, argues that the actions taken by the DOJ could undermine the very features that users love about their iPhones and ecosystem.

Comparisons have been drawn between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s. While there are similarities in their efforts to retain customers, there are also significant differences between the two companies. It remains to be seen how the lawsuit will unfold, but experts predict that it could take several years to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft made headlines this week with its acquisition of Inflection AI. The co-founders of the AI startup, Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, have joined Microsoft in key roles. Suleyman now leads Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Simonyan serves as the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

Nvidia's GTC event was also a highlight this week. The event, which is primarily focused on developers, had some surprises in store. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence is just five years away, and the company unveiled a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T. Nvidia continues to push the boundaries of AI technology.

In another interesting development, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model on iPhones. This collaboration raises questions about the future of Apple's own AI efforts. Will this be a temporary solution until Apple's AI catches up, or will it lead to a long-term partnership? Only time will tell.

Moving on to hacking and privacy concerns, the Biden administration is leading an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Investors are joining this effort, although it has been revealed that one of the investors had previously been involved in the spyware business. This raises questions about their intentions and commitment to fighting against these practices.

In the gaming world, a recent hack halted an Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed that their intentions were to highlight the exploit used and to draw attention to the developers. This incident serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities in online gaming and the need for constant vigilance.

Glassdoor, a popular platform for employee reviews, has faced criticism recently. Users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution offered by Glassdoor is to delete the accounts entirely. This raises concerns about privacy and the platform's handling of user information.

Moving on to funding and IPO news, Reddit's IPO got off to a strong start. The stock, which launched at $34 a share, saw a 48% jump on its first day of trading, closing at $46. This successful debut reflects the growing influence and popularity of the online community.

Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for data centers, also had a successful IPO. The company has benefited from the AI boom, with revenue growing by 45% to $115.8 million last year. Its stock closed at $62.03 on its first day of trading.

In other funding news, The Browser Company raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The startup, known for its Arc browser, has ambitious plans to replace PCs with browsers. However, its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we take a look at the limitations of AI. Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with spelling, as seen in AI-generated images. We explore the reasons behind this and the challenges that AI faces in mastering language.

On a different note, Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced a pause in production. The company is facing financial difficulties and may cease operations if it fails to secure additional capital.

Finally, we discuss the importance of reviewing AI systems. While it may be challenging to review systems like ChatGPT or Gemini, it is crucial to put them to the test. This helps ensure their accuracy, fairness, and ethical usage.

That's it for this edition of Week in Review.
