Summary: ETH Zurich researchers expose vulnerabilities in AMD and Intel's confidential computing technologies, revealing potential data access risks through interrupt mechanisms.","Title: The Unmasking of Confidential Computing: A Deep Dive into Cloud Security

Introduction

In recent years, hardware manufacturers have made significant strides in developing confidential computing technologies, enabling businesses and governmental organizations to process sensitive data securely using shared cloud computing resources. This approach isolates sensitive data during processing, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users and even the cloud provider. However, researchers from ETH Zurich have recently discovered security vulnerabilities in these systems, proving that hackers could potentially gain access to the data being processed.

The Interrupt Mechanism: A Hacker's Gateway

The ETH Zurich researchers conducted two attack scenarios using the interrupt mechanism, which temporarily disrupts regular processing for various reasons, such as prioritizing different computing tasks. With 256 different interrupts available, each one triggers a specific sequence of programming commands. According to Shweta Shinde, Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, interrupts have been overlooked as a potential security risk, allowing her team to identify vulnerabilities in server hardware from leading computer chip manufacturers, AMD and Intel.

The Research Behind the Discovery

The researchers discovered these security gaps while examining confidential computing technologies in AMD and Intel processors. Their interest was sparked by their work on an eavesdrop-proof smartphone based on confidential computing. The core of confidential computing lies in the trusted execution environment (TEE), a hardware-based component that isolates applications during processing. Accessing the application memory is then possible only with authorized code, keeping the data protected from unauthorized access while it is being stored, unencrypted, in the working memory during processing.

Hypervisors: The Instability Factor

In a public cloud, applications are isolated using a TEE, specifically from what's known as a hypervisor. Cloud providers use hypervisor software to manage resources, ensuring that different users can work securely in separate areas of the same cloud without disturbing each other. However, hypervisors can also be an instability factor, opening up various attacks that could potentially allow unauthorized access to data stored in the memories of other active cloud users working with the same hardware.

Limitations of User System Isolation

Fully isolating the hypervisor is impossible, as some communication must take place between the two. This communication interface can be exploited to send coordinated interrupts to the secured system",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2020/computerchips.jpg,2024-04-04 17:06:03,"Meta Description:

Introduction

Do you remember the first time you held a fiber optic cable and marveled at the light transmitting through it? That memory came rushing back to me when I learned about the recent achievement of UK Aston University researchers. They successfully sent data at a blistering 301 terabits per second (Tbps) over existing fiber networks. This speed is approximately 1.2 million times faster than the US' medium fixed broadband speed and fast enough to deliver 1,800 4K movies to your home in a single second.

The Aston University Breakthrough

Far from the Morse code I envisioned as a child, the Aston University team harnessed the power of the heretofore unused infrared spectrum's E-band and S-band, which have been previously disregarded due to the high error rates associated with transmitting over them. The researchers developed a unique solution to amplify the signal and monitor and adjust each wavelength channel in real-time using optical amplifiers and optical gain equalizers. This innovation ensures a solid network connection and paves the way for E-band speeds on existing optical fiber networks.

Implications for Internet Service Providers and Data Centers

While home users and small businesses may not require Tbps rates, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), data center operators, and those offering massive Large Language Models (LLMs) through a service can significantly benefit from this advancement. With the potential for every bit per second (bps) they can get and more, these entities can cater to the ever-increasing demand for high-speed, reliable connections.

The Green Solution for Faster Internet

As Professor Wladek Forysiak, who worked on the project, explained, ""Growing system capacity by using more of the available spectrum—not just the conventional C-band but also other bands such as the L, S, and now E-bands—can help to keep the cost of providing this bandwidth down. It is also a 'greener solution' than deploying more, newer fibers and cables since it makes greater use of the existing deployed fiber network, increasing its capacity to carry data and prolonging its useful life and",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/33b6664392e14c4387276adcaea003b25e0f8502/2024/04/05/6811d180-2a00-4791-b73f-4980b328334d/fiber20optics.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-05 00:00:00,"lessening the impact on the environment.""

Call to Action

Introduction

Imagine a world where humans can control robots from a distance, performing tasks that are too dangerous or complex for us. This is not a scene from a science fiction movie but a reality that researchers are bringing closer. Teleoperation, or the effective operation of robots from a distance, has the potential to revolutionize various industries. Recently, a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University developed a method called Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), which allows for the precise teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots using just an RGB camera.

The Power of Human2HumanOid (H 2 O)

H 2 O is a groundbreaking approach that could enable the training of humanoid robots on manual tasks requiring specific sets of movements. These tasks include playing sports, pushing a trolley or stroller, and moving boxes. According to Guanya Shi, co-author of the paper, ""Many people believe that 2024 is the year of humanoid, largely because the embodiment alignment between humans and humanoids allows for a seamless integration of human cognitive skills with versatile humanoid capabilities... Our work H 2 O (Human2HumanOid) takes the first step, introducing a real-time whole-body teleoperation system using just an RGB camera, which allows a human to precisely teleoperate a humanoid in many real-world tasks.""

Unlike many other methods, H 2 O relies only on an RGB camera, making it easily scalable and widely applicable. Tairan He, co-author of the paper, explains, ""We believe that human teleoperation will be essential for scaling up the data flywheel for humanoid robots, and making teleoperation accessible and easy to do is our main objective...

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/threads-missed-its-earthquake-moment-as-the-term-didnt-trend-until-the-afternoon/,Meta explains why the NYC/NJ earthquake didn't trend earlier in the day, Meta's Threads Struggles to Trend Real-Time: NYC/NJ Earthquake Example ,"Instagram's Threads: A Work in Progress

Instagram Threads, Meta's response to Twitter, has yet to shine as a platform for real-time trending topics. On Friday, when a minor earthquake hit the New York/New Jersey area, Twitter was once again the go-to platform for real-time discussions. With hashtags like earthquake, EastCoast, LongIsland, Philly, Manhattan, and Brooklyn trending, Threads struggled to keep up. 

Although there were conversations about the earthquake on Threads, it wasn't reflected in their trends until much later in the day. Unlike Twitter, Threads does not use hashtags, which can make it less obvious how to tag trending topics. Users have started using the tagging convention of ""[term] Threads,"" which could lead to multiple tags for the same event, confusing the algorithm and preventing it from gaining the necessary momentum to break into the top trends.

When TechCrunch asked Instagram about the earthquake's absence from Threads' top trends, they explained that trends are based on various signals, including how many people are talking about a given topic and how many people have engaged with posts on that same topic. Since the earthquake was a regional event, and trends are based on national conversations, it may have taken more time for enough people to join the conversation.

Threads' inability to keep up with real-time trends could hinder its ability to compete with Twitter. Additionally, Meta's plan to distance itself from political discussions could also impact Threads' growth. Twitter's founders recognized the power of their platform to deliver real-time information, making it the home of breaking news, active topical discussions, and a hub for journalists.

Twitter's impact was evident in 2006 when the San Francisco earthquake hit. The founders and users alike realized the potential of Twttr to deliver real-time information, creating a shared experience for users. Threads, despite having 130 million monthly active users, has struggled to replicate this experience. Max Read described Threads as the ""gas-leak social network,"" referring to the randomness of the posts that filled users' For You feeds.

Are you ready to take your social network experience to the next level? Social network X has announced that it will be rolling out access to xAI's Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers, following Elon Musk's announcement of the expansion to more paid users last month. Only Premium and Premium+ users can currently interact with the chatbot in select regions.

But what is Grok, and how does it work? Grok is an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot developed by xAI that was made available to Premium+ users last year. With this update, users paying $8 per month can now access the chatbot. Grok operates in two modes - ""Regular mode"" and ""Fun mode"" - with both modes showcasing labels indicating that the chatbot would return inaccurate answers, just like any other Large Language Model (LLM) product.

As we've seen in recent news, Grok is capable of summarizing trending news stories, much like other AI-powered chatbots such as Jeff Bezos and NVIDIA-backed Perplexity AI. However, Grok seems to take things one step further by writing headlines, as reported by Mashable.

So, what's the purpose behind this chatbot? Elon Musk likely wants to rival other products such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude. In recent months, he has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations, even going as far as suing the company in March over the ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goal. In response, OpenAI filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk's claims and released email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

What about transparency? xAI open-sourced Grok last month, but without any training data details. As my colleague Devin Coldewey argued, there are still questions about whether this is the latest version of the model and if the company will be more transparent about its approach to the development of the model and information about the training data.

In conclusion, the Grok chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot that can help you summarize trending news stories and even write headlines. While it may have its limitations and lack transparency, it's an interesting addition to the social network X platform. If you're looking to enhance your social network experience, consider trying out Grok and see if it's right for you.

X makes Grok chatbot available to premium subscribers

Are you ready to take your social network experience to the next level? Social network X has announced that it will be rolling out access to the Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers, following Elon Musk's announcement of the expansion to more paid users last month. Only Premium and Premium+ users can currently interact with the chatbot in select regions.

But what is Grok, and how does it work? Grok is an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot developed by xAI that was made available to Premium+ users last year. With this update, users paying $8 per month can now access the chatbot. Grok operates in two modes - ""Regular mode"" and ""Fun mode"" - with both modes showcasing labels indicating that the chatbot would return inaccurate answers, just like any other Large Language Model (LLM) product.

As we've seen in recent news, Grok is capable of summarizing trending news stories, much like other AI-powered chatbots such as Jeff Bezos and NVIDIA-backed Perplexity AI. However, Grok seems to take things one step further by writing headlines, as reported by Mashable.

So, what's the purpose behind this chatbot? Elon Musk likely wants to rival other products such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude. In recent months, he has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations, even going as far as suing the company in March over the ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goal. In response, OpenAI filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk's claims and released email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

What about transparency? xAI open-sourced Grok last month, but without any training data details. As my colleague Devin Coldewey argued, there are still",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Robotic systems have become a common sight in controlled indoor environments, performing tasks from assisting humans to providing information. However, their deployment in outdoor, unmapped, and occlusion-prone environments presents new challenges. To address these challenges, researchers from the University of Hong Kong have developed AGRNav, an innovative framework designed to enhance the autonomous navigation of air-ground robots in complex, occlusion-prone settings.

Traditional navigation systems struggle with predicting occlusions, resulting in higher collision probabilities and suboptimal pathways that consume more energy. AGRNav, however, can predict occlusions in advance, minimizing and avoiding collisions while creating efficient and energy-saving paths. This game-changing framework consists of two main components: a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) and a hierarchical path planner.

SCONet predicts the distribution of obstacles and their semantic features using a deep learning approach that requires minimal computational resources. In contrast, the hierarchical path planner utilizes the predictions made by SCONet to plan optimal, energy-efficient aerial and ground paths for the robot to reach a specified location.

In their study, the researchers evaluated AGRNav in both simulations and real-world environments using a customized air-ground robot. The results demonstrated that AGRNav outperformed all other baseline and state-of-the-art robot navigation frameworks, identifying optimal and energy-efficient paths for the robot.

AGRNav's potential applications are vast, including natural disaster response, package delivery to remote locations, environmental monitoring, and more. By making the underlying code open-source, developers worldwide can access and test AGRNav on various air-ground robotic platforms, paving the way for real-world deployments.

In summary, AGRNav is a significant leap forward in air-ground robot navigation, offering a more efficient, safe, and energy-saving solution for occlusion-prone environments. Its successful implementation in both simulations and real-world tests highlights the potential for air-ground robots to revolutionize various industries and applications.

Elon Musk to reveal Tesla's robotaxi on August 8, amidst debunked claims of abandoning budget-friendly EV plans. Musk had previously promised self-driving capabilities for Tesla vehicles, with ambitions of a ride-sharing network by 2020. Currently, Tesla vehicles have Autopilot and an FSD feature, but are not self-driving. Will the upcoming robotaxi bring the self-driving revolution closer?","Title: The Unveiling of Tesla's Robotaxi: A New Era of Autonomous Transportation

In a recent turn of events, Elon Musk, the enigmatic CEO of Tesla, has announced the upcoming reveal of a robotaxi, scheduled for August 8. This announcement comes shortly after Musk dismissed claims made by Reuters that Tesla was abandoning its plans for a more affordable electric vehicle (EV) to focus on a robotaxi, both of which were reportedly based on the same platform.

Tesla has been the subject of speculation for years regarding the development of two vehicles: a budget-friendly EV and a robotaxi. Musk has been known to waver between prioritizing a conventional car and one devoid of a steering wheel or pedals, as detailed in Walter Isaacson's biography of the CEO. Despite Musk's initial reluctance to commit to a traditional car design, engineers such as Franz von Holzhausen and Lars Moravy continued to work on the project in what Isaacson referred to as a ""shadow project.""

Musk's promise of self-driving capabilities in Tesla vehicles dates back to 2016 when he claimed that a Tesla would drive itself cross-country by the end of 2017. In 2019, Musk unveiled plans for the company's first robotaxis, envisioning a future autonomous ride-sharing network by 2020. However, these ambitious targets have yet to materialize. Most recently, Musk announced that a robotaxi, entirely devoid of a steering wheel and pedals, would be available by 2024.

Tesla vehicles currently come equipped with a driver-assistance system branded as Autopilot, with an additional ""full self-driving"" (FSD) feature available for $12,000. Despite the name, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. The FSD package includes several automated driving features that still demand constant driver supervision. These include Summon, a parking feature, as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that maneuvers a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, handles lane changes, and navigates interchanges.

In our digital age, it's common to use online platforms like Google Books and Google Scholar for research purposes. These tools provide access to a vast amount of literature, from books on specific topics to academic papers. However, recent developments have revealed a troubling trend: the appearance of low-quality, AI-generated content in these databases.

The first indication of this issue came to light when cybersecurity firm 404 Media discovered AI-generated books while exploring Google Books. They used a simple trick to uncover these books: searching for the phrase ""As of my last knowledge update,"" a common utterance in OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT. This phrase appeared in various books, raising concerns about the authenticity of the content and the authors behind them.

Upon further investigation, it was found that one author had published over 50 books in 2023, all between 50 and 100 pages long. These books covered a wide range of topics, from the Boston Marathon bombing to ancient Rome and famous Native Americans. Alarmingly, the writing in these books was superficial, resembling a Wikipedia entry at best and AI-generated facts at worst. Even more concerning, these books were available for purchase on Amazon and other retailers.

When 404 Media searched for the same phrase on Google Scholar, which is intended to store human-conducted research, they found 19 pages of results, including papers on at-risk youth, diabetes, autism, COVID-19, and airline pilot fatigue. This discovery highlights the potential for AI-generated content to infiltrate and contaminate academic research.

Although AI-generated content isn't a new phenomenon on the web, its appearance in reputable resources like Google Books and Google Scholar is alarming. When reached for comment, Google stated that it would ""continue to evaluate our approach as the world of book publishing evolves,"" but did not mention if they would remove these AI-generated works from their services.

As users of these platforms, it's crucial to maintain a critical eye when accessing information.

In the clandestine world of zero-day exploits, the price of tools capable of hacking popular devices and software has skyrocketed. Crowdfense, a startup that deals in these elusive vulnerabilities, recently unveiled its updated price list. Zero-days, which rely on unpatched software flaws, can now fetch up to $7 million for iPhone exploits, $5 million for Android, and several million for Chrome, Safari, WhatsApp, and iMessage vulnerabilities. This surge in pricing is a result of the increasing difficulty in breaching the defenses of devices and apps developed by companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Once upon a time, a single researcher could uncover and develop zero-day exploits for iPhones or Androids. However, the landscape has drastically changed. According to Paolo Stagno, the director of research at Crowdfense, ""this thing is almost impossible"" nowadays. The involvement of multiple researchers and the complexity of bypassing robust security features have driven up the cost.

Companies like Crowdfense and Zerodium act as intermediaries, acquiring zero-days from researchers and reselling them to government agencies and contractors, who allegedly need these tools for monitoring criminal activities. On the other hand, organizations like Trend Micro ZDI purchase zero-days with the aim of reporting them to affected companies to facilitate patching. Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at ZDI, stated, ""it should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we're using, whatever devices we're using."" The improved platform protections and detection of zero-day vulnerabilities by threat intelligence teams contribute to the increased time and resources required by attackers, consequently raising the prices.

In 2023, Google's Threat Analysis Group reported that hackers utilized 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild, with 75% targeting Google products and Android devices. Spyware vendors, often working with zero-day brokers, were responsible for the majority of these attacks.

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared his thoughts on innovation, risk-taking, and AI advancements during a Stanford event. As Alphabet faces increasing competition in the AI sector, Pichai addressed the challenges of maintaining a culture of innovation within a large organization and highlighted some of the most exciting developments in AI at Google.

The Challenge of Keeping a Giant Innovative

Pichai expressed his continuous concern about fostering innovation in a company with over 200,000 employees, given the ever-present threat of smaller, more agile startups. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a culture of risk-taking and exploration, even in a successful, established company like Google.

""History has shown that innovation can come from a small team in a garage, and scale doesn't always provide an advantage. Larger organizations, including Google, tend to become risk-averse as they grow, which makes it crucial to consciously work towards maintaining a culture of risk-taking and innovation.""

Creating the Right Incentives

Pichai acknowledged the difficulty in creating the right incentives for employees to take risks and innovate. He emphasized the importance of rewarding effort and risk-taking rather than solely focusing on outcomes.

""At Google, we're working on setting up a Google Labs-like initiative to make it easier for teams to prototype and experiment without worrying about the full brand and product expectations. This will encourage more internal prototyping and help people bring ideas to life more easily.""

Exciting AI Advancements at Google

Pichai shared his excitement about two major AI advancements at Google: multimodality and chaining discrete answers together for smarter workflows.

1. Multimodality - Google's latest LLM (Language Learning Model) can process different kinds of inputs, such as video and text, simultaneously. This allows it to handle large amounts of information in various formats and produce output in a contextually relevant manner.

The green bank's focus on smaller-scale projects spurs job creation, lowers energy costs, and fosters cleaner tech for rural, low-income, and disadvantaged communities. Ultimately, it helps the U.S. transition to a net-zero carbon future.","Title: The New Green Bank: A Game-Changer for Climate Tech Investment

A long-awaited reality in the U.S., the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, or the 'green bank,' has been established with $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act. This new initiative earmarks over $14 billion for underprivileged communities, aiming to finance clean energy projects that have been overlooked due to their smaller scale and lower profitability.

The green bank is set to provide loans for various climate tech projects, including residential and commercial energy upgrades. One of its key objectives is to attract private capital, with hopes of generating $7 for every dollar dispersed. However, this figure might be modest, as McKinsey anticipates more than $12 of private investment per dollar invested in the green bank.

Although the fund primarily targets consumers and small businesses, founders and investors can still reap the benefits. Equity investments are a possibility, and the increased demand for proven, commercially viable climate technologies should boost the market.

The green bank's impact extends beyond its initial funding, as its loans will create jobs, lower energy costs for American families, and contribute to a safer, healthier future for children. Furthermore, it sends a clear message to climate tech founders and investors that there is a market for consumer-level technologies tailored for low-income and disadvantaged communities.

The green bank's approach to financing smaller-scale projects is a significant shift from traditional banking practices. By offering loans for projects like residential heat pump installations and affordable housing retrofits, the green bank addresses the needs of communities often overlooked by larger financial institutions.

With a delinquency rate similar to other commercial lenders, the Connecticut Green Bank serves as a successful example of this model. Its success demonstrates the potential for the new green bank to create real benefits on the ground for people across America, particularly in rural, low-income, and disadvantaged communities.

In conclusion, the new green bank offers a remarkable opportunity to stimulate climate tech investment, address the challenges of underprivileged communities, and encourage private capital to participate in the transition to a cleaner, greener future.

Introduction

Over the years, the rapid advancement of technology has significantly shaped and changed the job landscape. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is no exception. As a content editor with expertise in refining written content, I've witnessed firsthand how AI can help improve efficiency in the workplace. However, the integration of AI into various industries has sparked discussions about its potential impact on employment opportunities and job displacement. In this blog post, we will explore the complex relationship between AI and jobs, focusing on the benefits and challenges it presents for both employees and employers.

The Double-Edged Sword of AI

Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that can bring about positive change in the workplace. Its ability to automate repetitive tasks and analyze large datasets can lead to significant cost savings for employers while increasing productivity and efficiency. However, this shift towards automation also raises concerns about job displacement and the loss of valuable human skills and experiences.

The Potential for Job Displacement

As AI becomes more sophisticated, there is a risk that some jobs may become obsolete. This is especially true for roles that primarily involve repetitive tasks or those that can be easily automated. For instance, some companies are considering replacing human writers, programmers, or designers with AI-driven tools like ChatGPT. While this may lead to cost savings for employers, it could also result in job losses for workers in these fields.

The Opportunity for Enhanced Productivity and Accessibility

On the other hand, AI offers numerous benefits for budget-constrained individuals and small businesses. By automating time-consuming tasks, AI can help these entities increase their work output, compete with larger players, and potentially regain personal time. Additionally, AI can democratize the creative process by enabling those with linguistic or artistic challenges to produce high-quality output that they might not have been able to create otherwise.

The Evolution of Work Roles and Career Paths

Throughout history, technological advancements have disrupted traditional work roles and career paths. While these changes can be painful for those in affected industries, they also open up new opportunities for growth and development. For instance, the advent of electronic switching in the early 20th century led to the loss of many jobs for human telephone operators.
