Researchers unveil LocoMan, a first-of-its-kind quadrupedal robot capable of handling objects using its legs, showcasing remarkable dexterity and adaptability. This revolutionary bot, standing at 70 cm and weighing around 15 kg, opens up possibilities for real-life problem solving and enhanced human-robot interaction.","Title: Introducing LocoMan: A Revolutionary Four-Legged Robot That Manipulates Objects With Its Limbs

In the ever-evolving world of robotics, engineers constantly strive to create machines that can mimic and even surpass human abilities. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Washington, and Google DeepMind have taken a significant step forward in this pursuit with the development of LocoMan, a groundbreaking quadrupedal robot capable of manipulating objects using the very same legs it utilizes for walking.

The concept of four-legged robots, or quadrupedal robots, is particularly appealing due to their inherent advantages, such as rapid movement over rough terrain and maintaining a low center of gravity. While some existing quadrupedal robots can interact with their environment, this is usually accomplished through additional appendages attached to the robot's frame—limiting its overall effectiveness. LocoMan sets itself apart by incorporating a novel design that enables the robot to grasp and manipulate objects with its legs, making it incredibly agile and versatile.

According to Ding Zhao, associate professor leading the CMU Safety AI Lab and the study's corresponding author, traditional quadrupedal robots often feature top-mounted arms for manipulation purposes, which can negatively impact the robot's load capacity, stability, and energy efficiency. Nature does not endow dogs with extra limbs, after all. To overcome these limitations, Zhao and his team created LocoMan, a robot boasting a distinctive morphology that lets it modify the alignment of its limbs for optimal object manipulation.

A critical component of LocoMan is the Loco-manipulator, a specially designed, cost-effective, lightweight, and modular manipulator featuring three degrees of freedom (DoF). Attaching two Loco-manipulators to the front legs transforms those limbs into nimble grippers, allowing them to function similarly to human hands. Moreover, the Loco-manipulator is relatively straightforward to manufacture, increasing its potential for widespread deployment.

LocoMan adheres to a comprehensive whole-body control (WBC) framework, enabling smooth transitions between five distinct operational modes: single-gripper manipulation, single-foot manipulation, bimanual manipulation, locomotion, and loco-manipulation. These diverse modes empower LocoMan to undertake intricate manipulation tasks efficiently, regardless of space constraints.

Through rigorous real-world testing, LocoMan demonstrated remarkable deftness, tackling various challenges, including opening doors, connecting electronic devices to power outlets, and retrieving items in cramped quarters. Standing only 70 cm tall and weighing approximately 15 kg, LocoMan proves that impressive dexterity need not come at the expense of size and portability.

As outlined in the study published in arXiv, LocoMan's creators envision a future where their invention contributes to addressing real-world issues. Further investigations will focus on enhancing the robot's skills via advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, potentially paving the way for more natural interactions between humans and robots. Specifically, the integration of vision-language models could enable LocoMan to interpret visual cues from its surroundings and respond to spoken commands, fostering more fluid and instinctive communication.

By pushing the boundaries of quadrupedal robotics, LocoMan embodies an exciting leap towards smarter, more adept mechanical companions. As these technologies advance, society stands to benefit significantly from the myriad applications made possible by innovations such as LocoMan.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-dexterous-four-legge-1.jpg,2024-04-19 06:50:01,"""LocoMan: A Revolutionary Quadruped Robot That Manipulates Objects With Its Limbs.

Introduction

Get ready for a significant shift in the world of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's latest halving event has taken place, cutting miner rewards by 50%. This adjustment aims to reduce new bitcoin production and control its supply. With a limited total of 21 million bitcoins, understanding halving's impact on price and miner operations is crucial. Let's dive into the details.

What Is Bitcoin Halving and Why Does It Matter?

Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed event occurring approximately every four years, affects bitcoin production. Miners utilize powerful computers to solve intricate mathematical problems. Upon completion, they receive a fixed number of bitcoins as a reward. When halving occurs, this reward gets reduced by half, slowing the entry of new bitcoins into circulation and potentially affecting price dynamics due to changes in supply and demand equilibrium.

How Often Does Halving Occur?

According to bitcoin's coding, halving happens after the formation of every 210,000 blocks where transactions are documented during the mining process – roughly translating to once every four years. However, exact timelines may vary.

Will Halving Impact Bitcoin's Price?

Predicting precise outcomes is challenging. While past trends show varying effects immediately after halving events, prices typically increase substantially a year later. Favorable market conditions often contribute to such growth. Consequently, if history repeats itself, the current halving might result in considerable appreciation within the upcoming year. Nevertheless, expert opinions differ regarding post-halving price projections.

Effects On Miners

As block rewards decrease, maintaining profit margins becomes increasingly difficult for miners. They must either improve operational efficiency or expand computational power to maintain revenue levels. Moreover, older equipment becomes obsolete quickly, forcing many smaller operators to exit the industry. Despite challenges, large-scale mining companies continue investing in advanced technology and infrastructure to stay competitive amid changing market conditions.

Conclusion

Navigating the implications of bitcoin halving requires attention to both pricing trends and miner adaptations. Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing supply and demand helps anticipate potential fluctuations in value. Meanwhile, observing miner strategies sheds light on industry resilience and evolution.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/20/fisa-nsa-fbi-government-surveillance/,Lawmakers vote to reauthorize US spying law that critics say expands government surveillance," US Surveillance Law Reauthorized, Expanded Amid Privacy Concerns ","Title: The Reauthorization and Expansion of Controversial US Surveillance Law: A Deep Dive

Introduction

In the early hours of Saturday, lawmakers reauthorized and expanded a contentious United States surveillance law, disregarding objections from privacy advocates and numerous legislators. This article delves into the implications of this decision, exploring both sides of the debate and examining the potential impact on individual privacy and national security.

Understanding the Revamped Surveillance Law

The approved bill extends the provisions of Section 702 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). These allow the government to access communication records from technology and telephone providers concerning foreign entities. However, opponents argue that FISA's scope inadvertently captures American citizens' conversations during its pursuit of foreign targets.

Government agencies and White House officials advocate for the law's continuation, asserting that it safeguards the nation against terrorism and cyber threats. They claim that most classified information presented in the presidential daily intelligence report stems from the Section 702 program. Nevertheless, concerns regarding possible abuse of power persist, particularly in relation to warrantless searches conducted on American citizens' communications without proper authorization.

Failed Attempts to Enhance Privacy Protections

Some bipartisan initiatives sought stricter regulations requiring warrants before investigating Americans' communications stored in the Section 702 database. Unfortunately, these attempts did not succeed prior to the final vote on the Senate floor. Consequently, the revised FISA act maintains its previous stance, permitting federal bodies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and National Security Agency (NSA) to search the database without obtaining a warrant first.

Stakeholder Perspectives

Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, defended the reapproved FISA, labeling it ""indispensable"" to America's intelligence apparatus. Meanwhile, civil liberties organizations and activists continue to criticize the lack of stringent privacy measures embedded within the law. Furthermore, skepticism surrounds the government's assurance of responsible usage, given past incidents involving alleged misuse of surveillance capabilities.

Key Provisions and Future Implications

One notable aspect of FISA is its built-in mechanism preventing abrupt cessation of governmental surveillance programs when facing lapses in legal authorities. In such cases, the government can rely on its existing annual certification from the clandestine FISA court—which supervises and greenlights surveillance operations—permitting continued utilization of lapsed powers until the subsequent certification period ends. Currently, the FISA court granted approval for the government's surveillance program under Section 702 in early April, validating its activities until at least April 2025.

With FISA set to terminate by the end of 2026, another round of intense negotiations between proponents and adversaries seems inevitable halfway through the following US administration. As these discussions unfold, striking a balance between protecting national interests and preserving individual rights remains paramount.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fisa-government-senate-reauthorization.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-20 13:00:44,"""Discover the debate: FISA reauthorization's impact on privacy & national security. Read now!"" 17 words","Title: Balancing Act: Navigating Individual Rights & National Security in FISA Reauthorization

Introduction

US lawmakers recently voted to reauthorize and expand certain provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), sparking heated debates among privacy advocates, legislators, and concerned citizens alike. This article explores the delicate equilibrium between personal freedoms and national security as illustrated by the FISA reauthorization.

Delving into FISA's Renewed Powers

The renewed legislation allows the government to intercept and analyze electronic communications linked to non-US individuals located outside the country under Section 702. Critics contend that this provision unintentionally ensnares American citizens' private exchanges while targeting foreign entities.

Despite opposition, supporters emphasize the importance of maintaining robust surveillance tools necessary for combatting global terrorism and cyber threats. With allegedly vital classified data derived from the Section 702 program, detractors question whether adequate checks exist to prevent potential abuses of power.

Privacy Protection Efforts: Hurdles Along the Way

Bipartisan efforts aimed at implementing tighter restrictions, including mandatory warrants for searching American citizens' communications contained within the Section 702 database, ultimately fell short ahead of the final Senate vote. Thus, the updated FISA statute retains its original language, enabling FBI and NSA personnel to peruse the database sans warrant.

Varied Viewpoints Abound

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner hailed the reauthorized FISA as essential for America's intelligence infrastructure; however, civil liberty groups and digital rights defenders remain steadfastly critical due to insufficient privacy protections. Trust issues arise surrounding government promises of judicious use, considering historical instances of alleged overreach in surveillance practices.

Noteworthy Amendments & Ongoing Challenges

An amendment incorporated into the new FISA requires that queries seeking information about U.S persons result in distinct reports detailing their identities, thereby promoting transparency. Nonetheless, questions lingering around accountability mechanisms highlight the ongoing struggle to strike a balance between upholding constitutional principles and ensuring public safety.

As FISA approaches sunset in late 2023, anticipation builds for future high-stakes negotiations encompassing personal liberties and collective security. It is crucial to navigate this complex terrain carefully, fostering dialogue and compromise to preserve both freedom and safety in our increasingly connected world.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Water scarcity is a pressing global issue, and the demand for efficient desalination technologies has never been greater. Traditional desalination methods, such as reverse osmosis, rely on delicate and expensive membranes that are susceptible to fouling and chlorine degradation. A new collaboration between Yale University and Nanjing University of Science & Technology has led to the development of a groundbreaking filtering membrane that promises to increase access to clean water worldwide.

Reverse osmosis is a popular water purification method that utilizes semi-permeable membranes to separate salt from seawater. Although polyamide membranes are commonly used due to their high water permeability and salt rejection, they are vulnerable to biofouling and chlorine damage. To mitigate these issues, costly pretreatment steps are typically employed.

In an attempt to overcome these limitations, researchers have developed a new reverse osmosis membrane made from polyester. This innovative material offers several advantages over polyamide membranes:

1. Superior water permeability: The polyester membrane allows for substantial water permeability, ensuring efficient desalination.
2. High salt and boron rejection: The membrane effectively filters out sodium chloride and boron, which are common contaminants in seawater.
3. Complete resistance to chlorine: Unlike polyamide membranes, the polyester membrane is resistant to chlorine degradation, eliminating the need for costly pretreatment steps.
4. Ultrasmooth, low-energy surface: The membrane's surface prevents fouling and mineral scaling, further enhancing its durability and performance.

Moreover, the researchers designed the membranes with industrial adoption in mind. The fabrication process mirrors that of state-of-the-art polyamide membranes, allowing for easy integration into existing production lines and rapid scalability.

Introduction

Rumors about Salesforce's interest in acquiring legacy data management firm Informatica sparked controversy among investors earlier this month. As details unfolded, it became evident that neither party involved was satisfied with the proposed merger terms. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the situation, there remains speculation regarding whether such a union would materialize and benefit both entities. This article examines the financial aspects of each company and discusses the strategic implications of a possible tie-up.

Understanding Investors' Concerns

Since breaking the news, Salesforce's stocks plunged approximately 10%, while Informatica investors showed dissatisfaction with the perceived undervaluation of their shares—leading to a drop comparable to Salesforce's losses. These reactions indicate investors' apprehension towards the merits of this supposed partnership, revealing the challenges faced by Salesforce in convincing stakeholders of the benefits associated with purchasing Informatica.

Salesforce's History With Acquisitions & Slowdown in Growth

Known for its aggressive acquisition strategy, having acquired 74 firms since its establishment in 1999, Salesforce took a break following increased scrutiny from activists coupled with slowing growth and rising interest rates. Last year, amidst mounting pressure, Salesforce opted for cost reduction strategies, including workforce cuts and abandonment of its internal M&A committee responsible for evaluating prospective acquisitions. However, with projected single-digital growth in the upcoming fiscal year, Salesforce may view Informatica as a means of augmenting revenue and maintaining market position.

Arguably, Salesforce's data integration tools remain competitive compared to Informatica's offerings. Moreover, investing heavily in infrastructure ahead of pursuing applications or copilots paths appears reasonable—as suggested by William Blair financial analyst Arjun Bhatia. Nevertheless, determining the true value of combining forces necessitates further investigation into both organizations' finances.

Exploring Financial Metrics

Last fiscal year, Salesforce exhibited an impressive 11% growth rate. Furthermore, it anticipated growing by 9% during its ongoing 2025 fiscal year. Alongside this announcement came a new dividend plan and an expanded share repurchase initiative valued at $10 billion. Interestingly enough, Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms Inc., revealed its initial dividend around the same time.

With double-digit revenue expansion becoming increasingly rare, especially amongst larger enterprises, Salesforce shifted gears toward emphasizing consistent earnings performance, substantial free cash flows, and rewarding investors via dividends and reduced share counts. Therefore, the proposition of allocating billions for Informatica raises questions concerning strategic alignment and prioritization of investments.

On the other hand, Informatica's revenue stands significantly lower than Salesforce's, rendering a minor impact on overall sales figures despite adding incremental revenue streams. Considering this discrepancy, one must weigh the rationale behind Salesforce's pursuit of Informatica against alternative investment opportunities yielding greater returns and synergies.

Conclusion

While only time will reveal whether a Salesforce-Informatica marriage transpires, assessing their respective financial standpoints offers valuable insights into the potential wisdom of such a move. Given Salesforce's slowed growth projections, increasing focus on generating stable profits, and sizeable war chest earmarked for acquisitions, the decision hinges upon identifying complementary assets aligning with its strategic objectives. Should Salesforce fail to articulate compelling reasons supporting this transaction, investors may continue voicing skepticism—potentially derailing the entire endeavor.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1934156363.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-19 17:09:07,"Meta Description (under 18 words): Analyzing Salesforce-Informatica Merger: Financials & Strategic Implications for Data Integration

Introduction

Researchers from the University of Bristol have recently made a groundbreaking discovery regarding the noise generation and propagation in futuristic aircraft engines, specifically focusing on those with boundary layer ingesting (BLI) ducted fans. These engines, although highly efficient and capable of reducing fuel consumption, present unique acoustic challenges that must be addressed for certification purposes. This article will delve into the findings of the study, highlighting the distinct noise sources identified and their variations based on thrust production levels. Furthermore, we will explore the implications of this research for the development of quieter airframe-integrated propulsion systems in future aircraft concepts.

Understanding BLI Ducted Fans and Their Noise Characteristics

Unlike traditional aircraft engines, BLI ducted fans are partially embedded into the plane's main body rather than being located underneath the wings. By ingesting air from both the front and the surface of the airframe, these engines require less effort to move the plane, resulting in lower fuel consumption. While BLI ducted fans offer numerous benefits, one critical challenge remains: their noise emissions. Addressing this concern is essential for acquiring necessary certifications and enhancing overall passenger comfort.

In their study, Dr. Feroz Ahmed and his team sought to understand the physics behind the noise generated by BLI ducted fans. Utilizing the University National Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Facility, they identified three primary noise sources associated with these engines: the duct, the rotating fan blades, and the air flowing over the curved airframe surface. Moreover, the researchers discovered that the noise pattern emitted by the fan varies depending on its thrust production level. Specifically, when the fan generates high thrust, the noise pattern mirrors that of typical fans without ducts. Conversely, when the fan produces less thrust, the noise pattern transforms due to increased sound emissions from the duct itself.

Implications for Future Aircraft Design

As the global demand for environmentally friendly transportation continues to grow, so too does the necessity for creating quieter aircraft with minimal environmental impact.
