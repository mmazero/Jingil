Introduction

Muscles as efficient actuators have inspired engineers to incorporate them into robot designs. Researchers from MIT developed a new spring-like device, enhancing muscle-based bots' motion and precision. This innovative ""flexure"" serves as a basic skeleton-like module for muscle-bound robots, addressing the limitations of traditional muscle-tissue attachment methods.

The Power of Muscles and the Need for Improved Skeletons

Muscles, when left alone in a petri dish, contract unpredictably. Traditional methods of attaching muscle tissue between two posts have resulted in limited movement due to the tissue's variability. To address this issue, MIT researchers designed a skeleton that could focus and maximize a muscle's contractions, generating the most movement in a predictable, reliable way.

Enter the Soft Flex

The perfect solution for a flexure design came from Professor Martin Culpepper's lab, where soft, flexible spring-like devices, or ""soft flexes,"" allow for efficient force-to-motion conversion in a single direction.

Design and Performance

The new flexure design consists of a ring of muscle tissue attached to a spring-like device, allowing the muscle to pull on it reliably and stretch it five times more compared to previous designs. The flexure can be combined with other flexures to build various configurations of artificial skeletons for muscle tissue integration.","Title: A New Spring-like Module: The Future of Muscle-powered Robots

Introduction

Muscles, nature's perfect actuators, have long been a subject of interest for engineers developing robots. Their power, precision, healing capabilities, and growth with exercise make them an attractive alternative to synthetic actuators. While some biohybrid robots have been built using muscle-based actuators, there is no general blueprint for maximizing muscle efficiency in various robot designs. Researchers from MIT have developed a new spring-like device, or ""flexure,"" that can serve as a basic skeleton-like module for muscle-bound bots, enhancing their motion and precision.

The Power of Muscles and the Need for a Better Skeleton

Muscles, when left alone in a petri dish under favorable conditions, will contract on their own, albeit in unpredictable directions. Traditional methods of attaching muscle tissue between two small, flexible posts have resulted in limited movement due to the tissue's variability. Depending on the muscle's placement and contact with the posts, the muscle may pull the posts together or wobble around uncontrollably.

To address this issue, Raman's group aimed to design a skeleton that could focus and maximize a muscle's contractions, generating the most movement in a predictable, reliable way. They theorized that if a muscle is to pull two posts together along a specific direction, the posts should be connected to a spring that only allows them to move in that direction when pulled.

Enter the Soft Flex

Raman found the perfect solution for a flexure design in Professor Martin Culpepper's lab, which specializes in precision machined machine elements. The lab's spring-like devices, or ""soft flexes,"" are soft and flexible in one direction but stiff in all other directions, allowing for efficient conversion of muscle force into motion in a single direction.

Design and Performance

The flexure design consists of a ring of muscle tissue attached to a spring-like device, similar to a rubber band stretched around two posts.

The realms of music and technology have been intertwined for centuries, with the music industry constantly evolving to keep up with technological advancements. As we step into the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the industry must address new challenges to ensure that music and technology continue to coexist harmoniously.

One such challenge arises from companies training large language models (LLMs) on data that they probably should not be using. Paul McCabe, Vice President of R&D at Roland, emphasized the need for responsible and equitable use of training data, even if it means compensating for the use of that data. While regulators will play a crucial role in enforcing compliance, galvanizing grassroots support and driving the need for updated copyright laws is equally important.

The introduction of new technology has not replaced human involvement in music production in the past, and GenAI is no exception. Drum machines, track recording, and music sampling have all contributed to the evolution of music without replacing live performances or orchestras. GenAI can benefit both musicians and the general public by expanding the creative horizons for songwriters and making it easier for beginners to learn new instruments through natural language processing and conversational prompts.

Roland, a leading manufacturer of keyboards and drum machines, aims to lay the groundwork for an AI-driven environment where music creators are equitably recognized and compensated for their work. In partnership with Universal Music Group, Roland has released ""Principles for Music Creation with AI,"" which highlights the importance of AI amplifying human creativity, ensuring transparency, and respecting human-created works.

These principles, aligned with Universal's Human Artistry Campaign, include essential guidelines such as obtaining authorization prior to using copyrighted works, music artists' names, images, likenesses, and voices, and compensating artists fairly. AI-powered platforms and policies should prioritize record-keeping and disclosure to maintain trust across all stakeholders, including fans and artists.

More than 60 global companies, including music labels, recording studios, and academia, have expressed interest in supporting these principles. Adopting the principles is voluntary, and the primary goal is to drive a responsible AI movement within the industry that is not owned by any one brand.

In the data-heavy digital age, Thunderbolt cable offers the quickest solution for transferring files to new MacBooks. Bypass Apple's Migration Assistant's lengthy 20-hour transfer estimate and enjoy speedy data migration with a Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable. Distinguish it from regular USB-C cables by looking for the Thunderbolt logo. Connect both Macs, launch Migration Assistant, and initiate the swift data transfer process.","Title: The Ultimate Data Migration Solution: Thunderbolt Cable to the Rescue

In today's digital age, our devices are constantly accumulating data, with no sign of slowing down. I've experienced this data boom myself, amassing nearly a terabyte of information on my MacBook Pro, primarily videos for editing. Although I consistently transfer data to my NAS, managing data has become increasingly challenging, especially after upgrading to a newer MacBook Pro.

Traditionally, I've relied on Apple's Migration Assistant to move data between Macs, but the latest transfer was projected to take a staggering 20 hours. This revelation prompted me to explore a better, faster solution. Enter the Thunderbolt cable.

While there are many Thunderbolt cables available, I recommend using a Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable, like the one from Apple, or a more affordable alternative, such as the Anker Thunderbolt 4 cable. However, it's essential to differentiate Thunderbolt cables from regular USB-C cables, as the latter offers significantly inferior performance. To make this distinction, look for the Thunderbolt logo on the cable.

Although I could have used Time Machine for backup, I find the process less efficient than the Thunderbolt cable method. Here's how to migrate data using a Thunderbolt cable:

1. Connect the Thunderbolt cables to both Macs.
2. Launch Migration Assistant, which will automatically select the fastest connection.
3. Begin the data transfer process.

During my recent migration, Migration Assistant optimistically projected transfer speeds of over 700 MB/s, which seemed a bit exaggerated. However, it estimated the completion time to be around three hours, aligning more closely with reality. Pleasantly surprised, I found that the entire process was completed in just about an hour.

With a mix of small and large files, I wasn't shocked by the inaccuracies in the estimated transfer time. For those with limited data, Wi-Fi may suffice. But if you have extensive data on storage drives, like me, the Thunderbolt cable is the superior choice.

In conclusion, migrating data between Macs doesn't have to be a time-consuming",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/102796d90fec11ab46d1bb5128c180a546e42ac9/2024/04/08/9d9172aa-db7b-4f71-be76-4db962ce1805/macbook-thunderbolt.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-08 00:00:00,"Meta Description:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/magnets-are-switching-up-the-keyboard-game/,Magnets are switching up the keyboard game, Magnetic Switches Revolutionize Mechanical Keyboards: Customizable Actuation Points ,"The Future of Mechanical Keyboards: Magnetic Switches

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity in recent years. Once a niche product, they quickly became a must-have for home offices during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become household names, offering a plethora of layouts and components for enthusiasts to choose from.

However, after this initial boom, the market has become somewhat stagnant. RGB lighting and various switch types have become standard, while gasket-mounted keyboards, once exclusive to high-end models, are now commonplace. While build quality and affordability have improved, the market is in dire need of innovation. Enter magnetic switches.

Magnetic switches offer the ability to quickly change the actuation point—the point during the keypress where the switch registers your downstroke. This feature can revolutionize the way we use mechanical keyboards, especially for gaming and typing.

Standard mechanical switches rely on physical contact between two metal leaves to register a key press. The stem's shape and legs determine the switch's feel and sound, while the spring and switch housing affect the actuation point. For instance, a Gateron Red switch registers a key press after 2 millimeters of travel distance and has a total travel distance of 4 millimeters.

Magnetic switches, on the other hand, utilize magnets and springs and activate by sensing changes in the magnetic field. This technology has been around since the 1960s, but has only recently gained popularity in the mechanical keyboard community. Magnetic switches use the Hall Effect, which relies on a magnet and a sensor to detect the switch's position. This allows users to customize the actuation point, making magnetic switches ideal for gaming and typing.

Customizing the actuation point can improve gaming performance, as you can register a key press the moment you start moving your finger. Additionally, you can increase the actuation point for typing to avoid errant keystrokes. Temperature calibration is also possible, making magnetic switches more precise in various environments.

Moreover, magnetic switches allow users to customize the release point, which can improve gaming performance. Users can quickly spam keys and customize the switch's resistance, making magnetic switches ideal for gaming and typing","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4330.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-07 16:30:40,Discover the future of mechanical keyboards with Magnetic Switches: customize actuation & release points for enhanced gaming & typing.

Drones have become increasingly popular in various industries, from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions. However, one significant limitation of drone technology is battery life. A team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark has been tackling this issue by developing a groundbreaking system that enables drones to recharge directly from power lines. This innovative approach could revolutionize the way we use drones, particularly for power line inspection.

In their latest project, the researchers equipped a Tarot 650 Sport drone with a customized electric quadcopter propulsion system, an autopilot module, and other essential components. The drone was also fitted with a gripper system, camera, and millimeter-wave radar system. When the drone's battery level drops, these systems work together to locate the nearest power line and initiate the charging process.

The drone approaches the power line from below, using a pair of inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into the gripper. An inductive charger then draws current from the power line, recharging the battery. Once the battery reaches full capacity, the gripper releases the power line, and the drone resumes its mission.

This technology holds great potential for power line inspection drones. In a recent demonstration, the self-charging drone successfully completed five charging cycles while inspecting power lines over a continuous period of two hours. The researchers presented their findings at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, highlighting the world's first system capable of sustaining operation through multiple inspection and charging cycles using energy harvested from power lines in a real-world outdoor environment.

The ability to recharge directly from power lines significantly enhances drone endurance and autonomy. By reducing the need for human intervention and battery replacements, this innovation could lead to substantial cost savings and increased efficiency in various applications. Moreover, it could pave the way for more sophisticated drone operations, such as extended surveillance, disaster management, and long-distance package delivery.
