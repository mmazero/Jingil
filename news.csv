https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080,"""MIT tool predicts loss of outdoor days by region due to climate change""","The Earth's climate is a complex and ever-evolving concept, making it challenging to relate to in a meaningful way. Researchers at MIT have developed a tool that could help people understand the impact of climate change on their region. The tool predicts the number of ""outdoor days"" that a region might experience from now until 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked.

The results of this tool are alarming or comforting, depending on where you live. For instance, California, France, and Germany can expect to experience slightly more clement weather in the spring and fall, adding a few days to a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records. However, some temperate places like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. In contrast, Nigeria and India will lose almost two and a half months of outdoor days respectively.

If the world fails to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but still manages to by 2070, the situation will improve dramatically. For instance, Nigeria and India will only lose one month of outdoor days, and more northerly regions will retain some of their added outdoor days.

Climate scenario analysis is a relatively new field that uses computational power to predict the impact of climate change on various regions and demographics. It is a branch of strategic planning that seeks to understand how climate change will affect various regions and demographics. A range of startups use this predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future.

Investors, lenders, and insurers are some of the customer bases for climate forecasting companies. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on these markets, providing customers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. These startups also determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought and deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains. They can also crank out regulatory disclosures, highlighting relevant climate risks.

Other markets exposed to the outdoors, such as agriculture, are also in need of solutions.

Introduction

In a significant announcement last week, the Linux Foundation revealed that it will host Valkey, a fork of the widely used Redis in-memory data store. Backed by tech giants such as AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, Valkey marks a new chapter in the evolving landscape of open-source projects and their relationship with big industry players. Let's delve deeper into the background, reasons, and implications surrounding this eventful split.

A Brief History of Redis and Its Licensing Disputes

Originally developed in 2009 by Salvatore Sanfilippo under the BSD license, Redis rapidly garnered popularity due to its powerful performance and versatile features. However, throughout its existence, Redis encountered several licensing disagreements. Initially, Redis Labs emerged as a prominent Redis service provider, leading to tension between the two entities. Ultimately, Redis Labs rebranded itself as Redis while acquiring Sanfilippo's intellectual property in the process.

Fast forward to 2018, Redis modified its module licensing terms by adopting the Apache License along with the Commons Clause—which restricted other parties from selling and hosting these modules. Although Redis maintained that the open-source Redis license remained unaffected, recent events proved otherwise.

The Trigger: Redis Adopts the SSPL

On March 20, Redis Labs shifted its primary software to the Server Side Public License (SSPL)—a less permissive and more restrictive license compared to the previously employed BSD license. As per the new policy, offering Redis-as-a-service required entering into commercial agreements with Redis Labs, thereby rendering it incompatible with traditional definitions of ""open source."" Consequently, this shift paved the way for potential alternatives, including the emergence of Valkey.

Birth of Valkey: An Open Source Collaborative Effort

Following Redis' adoption of the SSPL, AWS and Google Cloud collaboratively sponsored a fork named Valkey. Spearheaded by former Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson, Valkey attracted numerous contributors seeking to preserve the original spirit of Redis as an open-source project. With a majority of previous Redis maintainers joining forces with Valkey, the future appears promising for this burgeoning community.

Implications for Big Industry Players and Developers

As Valkey gains momentum, questions arise regarding the impact on established partnerships and collaboration models between developers and big technology companies. While there may be short-term disruptions, the rise of Valkey could foster innovation, healthy competition, and ultimately lead to better solutions for users across various industries.

Conclusion

While the separation between Redis and Valkey might seem tumultuous, the underlying principles of openness, transparency, and community involvement continue to thrive. By embracing the power of collaboration, both factions can harness collective knowledge and resources to drive progress and push boundaries. Only time will tell how this divide shapes the world of open-source databases; nevertheless, one thing remains certain: the resilience of communities dedicated to fostering growth, learning, and technological advancement.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"Actionable Meta Description: Valkey, a new fork of Redis, marks a new era in the open-source landscape.

Title: Kobe University Develops Revolutionary High-Efficiency Direct Current Voltage Booster","Title: Kobe University Develops Revolutionary Direct Current Voltage Boost Converter

Are you tired of bulky, inefficient, and expensive electrical components? Kobe University has developed a groundbreaking direct current voltage boost converter that could change the game for power generation, healthcare, mobility, and information technology. This innovative device combines high-frequency switching with a technique that reduces electromagnetic noise and heat dissipation, called ""soft switching,"" while also reducing the number of components and complexity.

Boost converters are ubiquitous and essential components for converting low-voltage direct current (DC) input into high-voltage DC output for various applications, including solar panels, wind turbines, medical devices, and electric vehicles. The main challenge for boost converters is to increase efficiency, reduce maintenance and cost, and minimize electromagnetic noise and heat generation.

Mishima Tomokazu, a researcher at Kobe University's power electronics department, and his team have made significant progress in developing a new direct current power conversion circuit. They managed to combine high-frequency switching (over 10 times faster than before) with the soft switching technique, which guarantees zero voltage during the switch transition, thus minimizing heat loss and electromagnetic noise.

Their key achievement is the use of ""resonant tank"" circuits that can store energy during the switching period and have much lower losses than traditional snubbers. In addition, they use a component-saving design with flat components printed onto a circuit board, called a ""planar transformer,"" which is very compact, efficient, and thermally stable.

The Kobe University team built a prototype of the circuit and measured its performance. The results were impressive: their design had a high energy efficiency of over 91.3%, which is unprecedented for a MHz drive with a high voltage multiplier ratio. The power conversion ratio was also over 1.5 times higher than existing designs. However, they want to further increase the efficiency by reducing the power dissipation of the magnetic components used.

This innovative development has significant implications for various industries and applications. It could lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable power generation, healthcare, mobility, and information technology. Mishima explains their plans going forward: ""We plan to expand the power capacity to a larger kW-class capacity in the future by improving the electronic",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-high-boost-and-high.jpg,2024-04-01 09:35:04,"DC-DC converter and optimizing the power delivery efficiency.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/the-market-is-forcing-cloud-vendors-to-relax-data-egress-fees/,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees," Amazon, Microsoft, and Google relax egress fees for cloud customers. ","Have you ever felt frustrated by the high egress fees charged by cloud providers? Well, you're not alone. The big three cloud vendors, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, have recently relaxed their egress fees, and it's not just a nice gesture. It's a recognition of changing market dynamics and a need for cloud providers to remain competitive.

The cloud market is becoming more and more competitive, and customers now have the power to choose where they want to store their data. This is why cloud providers are starting to loosen their restrictions on data movement. However, it's important to note that these changes come with limits and requirements that can make it difficult for customers to move their data. For example, some vendors require customers to contact them and open a request to get their data out of the cloud.

The shift towards a multi-cloud world is another factor that has contributed to this change. In the past, cloud providers tried to build ""walled gardens"" that made it difficult for customers to move their data between platforms. But with the rise of multiple platforms, it's becoming increasingly important to remove friction around data movement.

As cloud providers face increasing competition, they need to provide customers with what they want to remain competitive. This means making it easier for customers to move their data between platforms. The rise of multi-cloud environments and the need for seamless data movement has become more important than ever.

The shift away from egress fees to more customer-friendly policies is a positive development for cloud customers. However, it's important to remember that egress fees are just one aspect of the overall cost of cloud services. Customers should carefully review their bills and consider the costs of all services before making a decision.

Startups may not be affected as much by these changes as larger enterprise customers. However, the experience of startups is sure to improve as providers focus on innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty.

The recent changes in egress fees are a small but important step towards a more competition-friendly cloud market. While there may still be limits and requirements in place, customers can now move their data with greater ease and confidence. As the market continues to evolve, we can expect to see more changes that prioritize customer satisfaction and competition.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1862779720.jpg?resize=1200,738",2024-03-31 16:00:41,"Optimize your cloud egress fees with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's relaxed policies.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/tiktok-ban-implication-amazon/,TikTok ban could harm Amazon sellers looking for alternatives,"SEO Title: ""TikTok Ban and Amazon Sellers: Trends and Opportunities""","Title: The Potential Impact of TikTok Ban on Amazon Sellers

Introduction:

In recent months, merchants have flocked to TikTok to peddle their products to U.S. buyers through TikTok Shop. However, the potential TikTok ban could prematurely end TikTok's e-commerce dream and leave sellers seeking new channels.

Body:

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in March that could force ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban in U.S. app stores. While the focus of the related discussion has been on data security and speech rights, it highlights the growing e-commerce business of TikTok and how it is being squeezed by the interplay of tech giants and geopolitics.

TikTok Shop, launched in September 2023 with 200,000 merchants already on board, has not provided updated numbers on its active merchants, sales, or sales outside of the platform. However, research by Jungle Scout shows that 20% of Amazon sellers, brands, and businesses plan to expand to TikTok Shop this year, with ByteDance projecting that it could grow its U.S. e-commerce business tenfold to $17.5 billion this year.

TikTok is not the only platform for merchants looking for new channels to expand their customer bases. Its rise is part of a broader shift around alternative marketplaces like Temu, which has been attracting more attention from both shoppers and e-commerce exporters and merchants. Amazon has reportedly taken notice, another indication that alternatives are gaining traction.

Merchants have been interested in selling on TikTok due to its massive engagement, with nearly 70% of sellers reporting an increase in sales year-over-year for the first 11 months of 2023. Additionally, TikTok has been offering subsidies to merchants, especially to encourage them to mark down their prices during the Black Friday sales period.

According to Jungle Scout, nearly 20% of consumers began their search for products on TikTok in the first quarter of 2023, up 44% from a year ago. While 56% of all consumers still preferred to start their product","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=1200,669",2024-03-30 17:00:02,"search on Amazon, the trend towards TikTok is changing, as younger shoppers are more likely to use TikTok for discovery.

While the potential TikTok ban could have a significant impact on Amazon sellers looking for new channels to expand their customer base, it's important to remember that there are always alternatives available. By staying informed and being prepared, merchants can continue to grow their businesses and adapt to the ever-changing e-commerce landscape.

It's also important to note that if a TikTok ban were to occur, it would not necessarily mean the end of TikTok's e-commerce business. The platform could still continue to function as a social media platform and potentially transition to a different business model. However, it would certainly be a setback for merchants who have been investing time and resources into the platform.

Introduction:

Optoelectronics is a rapidly growing field, with potential applications in various fields such as healthcare, energy, and communication. However, to realize the full potential of optoelectronics, it is crucial to develop miniaturized devices that consume less energy while being highly efficient.

One of the challenges in this regard is the need for high gate capacitance, which allows for storing more electrical charge in proportion to the voltage applied. While using high dielectric constant (κ) materials, such as hafnium oxide (HfO 2 ), can help achieve this goal, their integration with 2D semiconductors has proven difficult.

In this article, we will explore a recent study by researchers at Fudan University that has prepared a 2D perovskite oxide with high-κ that can be integrated with different 2D channel materials.

Body:

Perovskite oxides have been gaining attention in recent years due to their high dielectric constant, which makes them promising for high-κ gate dielectrics. However, conventional three-dimensional dielectrics are challenging to integrate with 2D materials with dangling-bond-free surfaces.

To address this challenge, researchers at Fudan University prepared a 2D perovskite oxide, Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , using a top-down approach. The Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , exhibits a high κ of 24.6 and a moderate bandgap, making it suitable for phototransistors based on various 2D semiconducting materials.

To evaluate the potential of Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , the researchers transferred it onto various channel materials, including molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide. They then tested the performance of transistors integrating these materials with Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 .

The results were highly promising, with molybdenum disulfide transistors exhibiting an on/off ratio of 106 with a supply voltage of 2 V and a subthreshold swing of 88 mV dec−1. Tungsten disulfide phototransistors showed a photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio of ~106 and UV responsivity of 5.5 × 10^3 A W−1 under visible or UV light illumination.

Moreover, the well-defined interface established between the semiconductor and dielectric, along with the high-κ of Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 , were found to enable the efficient gate control of channel materials. Additionally, the phototransistors with the photoactive dielectric could offer UV-visible dual-band photodetection, where UV and visible light illumination are distinguished at separate terminals.

Conclusion:

The recent work by Li, Liu, and their collaborators paves the way for the synthesis of additional 2D perovskite oxides that can be integrated with existing semiconductors and channel materials. Collectively, these 2D perovskite oxides could be used to develop smaller, better performing, and energy-efficient electronics or optoelectronics.

With its high-κ, efficient gate control, and UV-visible dual-band photodetection, Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 could be a promising material for the development of miniaturized optoelectronics in the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/using-a-2d-perovskite.jpg,2024-04-01 06:30:01,"Optimize Meta Description:

Lee is a regular fixture on Forbes's Midas List of top-performing VCs, with nine IPOs in the last five years, including the smartphone giant Xiaomi and the software development company Kingsoft WPS. Foo is credited with deals that include electric carmaker Xpeng Motors, ride-hail giant Didi, and delivery company Grab.

Notable Capital, which plans to continue investing in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, is led by Tung, Richards, and Solomon. Tung has deals with known brands like Airbnb, StockX, and Slack, while Richards has backed Coinbase, Tile, and Handshake. Solomon has deals with HashiCorp, Opendoor, and Drata. Oren Yunger, the newest member of GGV Capital, will remain on Notable Capital.

The split of GGV Capital resulted in Granite Asia managing a collective $5 billion in assets, leaving Notable Capital with roughly $4.2 billion based on GGV Capital's assets under management at the time of the split. The investors raised $2.5 billion for their new funds in 2018, marking their largest family of funds ever. Since then, they have split their assets under management, including the capital raised prior, resulting in the current split.

In conclusion, the rebranding of GGV Capital's Singapore-based operation and the creation of Notable Capital from the U.S. team reflects a growing trend among VC","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-31-at-11.17.49-AM.png?resize=1200,793",2024-04-01 05:46:34,"""GGV Capital rebranded its Singapore-based operation as Granite Asia, while Notable Capital was spun off from the U.S. team.

The company announced that games with leaderboards were coming to the professional social media network, allowing employees to compete against each other. Now, we're learning that short-form videos are on their way.
Following in the footsteps of TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook and Instagram Reels, LinkedIn is apparently adding short videos to the site, as first spotted by user Austin Null. While posting videos on LinkedIn has been possible before, this feature focuses on short videos that you can quickly scroll through. LinkedIn confirmed the test to TechCrunch last week.
In the past, LinkedIn used to let users post ""fun and casual"" ephemeral videos, but they killed the Stories feature in August 2021. At the time, the company wanted to move to ""a reimagined video experience that's even richer and more conversational.""
The new feature is still in its early stages, meaning that most users don't have access to it yet. However, we know that the content will be housed in a new Video tab at the top of the navigation bar. Clicking on that tab will open a video that you can like, comment on, or share. Swiping away will open the next video, similar to other short-form video sites.
While other short-form video sites offer a wide range of content that an algorithm tries to quickly tailor to your specific interests, LinkedIn hasn't said how their feed will be curated yet.
Despite this, LinkedIn hasn't officially announced the feature yet, so there's no word as to when we can expect a wider rollout. However, one thing is clear - LinkedIn is constantly looking for new ways to keep users engaged and distracted from their work.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9a779fa5377ff276b245770deaa45c448d3e963d/2024/04/01/8160075a-0736-421b-9cdc-70c6753c00ea/linkedin-video-screensot.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"LinkedIn is testing a new feature that allows users to post short-form videos.

Hey there, tech enthusiasts! Welcome to the latest edition of TechCrunch's Week in Review (WiR), where we recap the most exciting and noteworthy happenings in the tech world over the past few days.

Fisker's Oops Moment

This week, TC's auto reporter Sean O'Kane revealed that EV startup Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that took months to complete. As a result, Fisker temporarily suspended trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Snapchat Privacy Scandal

In other news, Lorenzo reported that Facebook (now known as Meta) had been secretly snooping on users' Snapchat traffic in a project internally known as ""Project Ghostbusters."" According to court documents, the goal was to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat's app and its servers.

Stability AI's Struggle

Manish shared the news that Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque had resigned from the company. Mostaque's departure comes amid an ongoing struggle for stability at the company, which was reportedly spending around $8 million a month as of October 2023 with little revenue to show for it.

The Week's Other Happenings

There was plenty more happening in the tech world this week, including:

 Fisker's bad week continued with a halt in the startup's stock trading.
 Google added the ability for users to ask its Search engine to plan a travel itinerary, using AI to draw on ideas from websites around the web along with reviews, photos, and other details.
 Robinhood announced the launch of its new Gold Card, powered by X1's technology, with a range of features that could make Apple Card users envious.
 AT&T failed to disclose how a hack responsible for spilling the personal information of 73 million of its customers happened over three years ago.

In Funding News

This week's funding roundup included:

 Copilot, the budgeting app, raised $6 million in a Series A round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent.
 Liquid Death, a canned water startup, raised $67 million, bringing its total raised to over $267 million.
 Dan Laufer, a former Nextdoor exec, raised $25 million from Canvas Ventures and others for PipeDreams, a startup that acquires mom-and-pop HVAC and plumbing companies and scales them using its software that helps with scheduling and marketing.

In Analysis

Ron wrote about how there are many parallels in Nvidia's and AWS' growth trajectories.

Podcast Highlights

This week on Equity, the crew discussed Robinhood's new credit card, Fisker's latest woes, and Databricks' new AI model that it spent $10 million to spin up. They also spotlighted two companies building startups focused on kids and looked at a new $100 million fund that seeks to back innovative climate tech.

On Found, Allison Wolff, the co-founder and CEO of Vibrant Planet, a cloud-based planning and monitoring tool for adaptive land management, discussed why the wildfires we're seeing today are hotter and spreading more quickly than we can contain and how proper land management can help foster lower, slower-burning fires.

Chain Reaction also featured an interview with Scott Dykstra, CTO and co-founder of Space and Time. Space and Time aims to be a verifiable compute layer for web3 that scales zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic action used to prove something about a piece of data without revealing the origin data itself.

Bonus Round

Finally, Spotify is testing online learning, beginning with a rollout in the U.K. The (traditionally audio) streaming platform is testing the waters for an online education offering of freemium video courses.
