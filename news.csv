Tesla has reportedly scrapped plans for a $25K EV, refocusing on a robotaxi, per Reuters. Despite CEO Elon Musk's denial, the shift in priorities highlights the ongoing debate between a traditional car and a robotaxi design. The ambitious robotaxi vision could propel Tesla to new heights.","Title: Tesla's Shifting Focus: From Affordable EVs to Autonomous Robotaxis

Tesla, known for its pioneering work in the electric vehicle (EV) market, has reportedly abandoned plans to develop a more affordable EV, according to a Reuters report. Instead, the company will concentrate its resources on a planned robotaxi, built on the same platform initially intended for the economical EV.

Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has disputed the Reuters report but hasn't refuted any specific details. The saga of these two vehicles has been ongoing for a few years, with Musk wavering between a conventional car and a futuristic robotaxi, even without a fully autonomous vehicle in production.

The idea of a budget-friendly Tesla was first floated in 2020, but by early 2022, Musk announced that the project had been halted due to other priorities. However, the project was quickly revived, though the company's top brass couldn't agree on whether to focus on a traditional car or a robotaxi.

In Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, the CEO is quoted as insisting on a clean robotaxi design in mid-2022, despite engineers' suggestions to include a steering wheel and pedals. Musk boldly claimed that this vehicle would ""transform everything"" and propel Tesla to become a ""ten-trillion [dollar] company.""

Despite Musk's vision, lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy maintained a more conventional car project as a ""shadow project."" In September 2022, they presented a plan to Musk for an inexpensive, compact car necessary for achieving Tesla's ambitious 50% annual growth goal. They also proposed using the same platform for both models.

Musk initially dismissed the $25,000 car project as ""not that exciting,"" but by early 2023, he had agreed to proceed with the plan. However, recent developments have put this plan in limbo. According to Reuters, citing internal documents, work has stopped on the traditional car project in favor of the robotaxi approach.

Several factors may have contributed to this shift.

This concept built upon Moghadam's long-standing interest in creator compensation, which dates back to 2009.

Co-founding Rap Genius and Genius

After graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, Moghadam became a lawyer just as the economy was crashing in 2008. When he was eventually let go from his law firm, he used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius with two of his Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman. Rap Genius started as a platform for users to annotate and explain hip-hop lyrics, eventually evolving into Genius and expanding its focus to include annotations for various types of content.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scalable-learningbased-framework-teleoperation-humanoid.html,A scalable reinforcement learning-based framework to facilitate the teleoperation of humanoid robots, Teleoperating Humanoid Robots: Carnegie Mellon's Human2HumanOid Framework ,"Title: Teleoperating Humanoid Robots with Human2HumanOid: A Revolutionary Approach

Introduction

The concept of teleoperation, or remotely controlling robots, has opened up a world of possibilities. It allows humans to carry out a wide range of manual tasks from a distance, including dangerous and complex procedures. Moreover, teleoperation can be used to collect human motion data, which can help train humanoid robots in new tasks. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed an innovative method called Human2HumanOid (H 2 O) to enable effective teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots. This article discusses the significance and benefits of this groundbreaking approach.

The H 2 O Method

H 2 O is a real-time whole-body teleoperation system that relies solely on an RGB camera. This feature makes it easily scalable and widely applicable. The researchers aimed to create an interface between humans and humanoid robots to collect data and develop algorithms for seamless integration.

Advantages and Applications

The H 2 O method facilitates the teleoperation of full-sized humanoid robots in real time, enabling the compilation of extensive human motion datasets. These datasets can be retargeted to humanoid robots, allowing humans to control them and reproduce their body movements.

H 2 O is based on reinforcement learning (RL), which refines motion datasets to ensure feasibility for humanoid physical constraints. The RL-based motion imitator is then transferred to the real robot without further adjustment.

The main advantage of this approach is its minimal hardware requirements and the capability to perform a wide range of dynamic whole-body motions in real time. This opens up new possibilities for humanoid robot applications in environments where human presence is risky or impractical.

Real-World Tests

The researchers successfully demonstrated the H 2 O framework in real-world tests, where they teleoperated a humanoid robot and reproduced various motions, such as displacing a box, kicking a ball, pushing a stroller, and catching a box to drop it into a waste bin.

Future Implications

The H 2 O framework could be employed to replicate various motions and train robots in numerous real-world tasks. These tasks may include household chores, maintenance tasks, medical assistance, and even",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-scalable-reinforceme.jpg,2024-04-06 08:30:01,"Meta Description:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/amazon-bazaar-india-low-cost-fashion-and-lifestyle-store/,Amazon takes on India rivals with low-cost fashion store," Amazon's ""Bazaar"": A Fierce Entry into India's Fast-Fashion Market at $1.55 ","Title: Amazon's New ""Bazaar"" Store: A Fierce Entry into India's Fast-Fashion Market

Introduction

Amazon has discreetly launched a new store called ""Bazaar"" in India, offering affordable and trendy fashion and lifestyle products. This move aims to strengthen Amazon's position in the Indian fast-fashion market, where competitors like Walmart-owned Flipkart and Reliance's Ajio have already made significant inroads.

The Birth of Bazaar

Amazon introduced Bazaar on its India Android app, following a recruitment drive for sellers in February. The store promises hassle-free delivery, zero referral fees, and access to a massive customer base. Bazaar features clothing, accessories, jewelry, handbags, shoes, traditional and western wear, kitchenware, towels, bed linens, and decor items, catering to the growing popularity of affordable fast-fashion in India.

Significance in the Indian Market

India's e-commerce landscape is evolving, with mobile and consumer electronics' market share declining while fashion experiences robust growth. Fashion now dominates the e-commerce category, making it essential for Amazon to establish a strong foothold in this segment. Bazaar's offerings include trendy t-shirts starting at 129 Indian rupees ($1.55) and sneakers below $3, appealing to budget-conscious consumers.

Amazon's Investment in India

India is a vital overseas market for Amazon, which has invested over $11 billion to date. Although Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintains its market-leading position in India, its e-commerce arm lags behind Flipkart. Last year, Amazon announced plans to invest $12.7 billion in AWS and $2 billion in the e-commerce division in India by 2030.

Rivals and the Fast-Fashion Market

Flipkart, which owns the fashion e-commerce platform Myntra, currently leads the fast-fashion category. However, Reliance's Ajio is rapidly gaining market share, capturing around 30% in roughly a year, as per Bernstein. Ajio launched its fast-fashion platform, Ajio Street, offering clothing and accessories","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1169388446.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 18:49:01,"Meta Description:

Instagram's Threads lags in competing with Twitter, as earthquake trends show. The platform's design, lacking hashtags, hampers tagging consistency and trend visibility. Meta's distancing from political discussions may further limit Threads' growth, even with 130M monthly users.","Instagram's Threads: A Work in Progress, Struggling to Compete with Twitter

Instagram Threads has yet to live up to its potential as a competitor to Twitter, despite its similar text-focused format. When users flocked to Twitter to discuss the New York/New Jersey area earthquake, earthquake quickly became a top trend. However, earthquake-related terms were absent from Threads' trends section until much later in the day. While conversations about the earthquake did take place on Threads, they were not centralized under a single, easily identifiable term due to the platform's design choices.

One major difference between Threads and Twitter is the absence of hashtags on the former. This decision, made in the name of a cleaner user interface, may actually make it more difficult for users to understand how to tag trending terms. As a result, discussions of the earthquake on Threads were tagged in various ways, such as earthquake, ""earthquake threads,"" or targeted towards local communities like ""NYC Threads."" This lack of consistency in tagging made it difficult for any one term to gain the necessary momentum to trend on the platform.

When asked about the earthquake's absence from Threads' trends, a representative from Instagram stated that the platform's top trends are based on various signals, including the number of people talking about a given topic and the amount of engagement with those posts. Because the earthquake was a regional event, and trends are based on national conversations, it may have simply taken more time for enough people to join the conversation. However, this inability to keep up with trends in real time could ultimately harm Threads' ability to compete with Twitter.

Furthermore, Meta's plan to distance itself from political discussions on Instagram and Threads could also limit the platform's potential. Twitter's founders recognized the power of their platform to deliver real-time information, making it a hub for breaking news and active topical discussions. In contrast, Threads may never fully be able to supersede Twitter, even if it builds many of the same features.

Despite having 130 million monthly active users, Threads has already shown signs of failing to deliver a truly Twitter-like experience.

Introduction:
Meta, the social media giant, has recently updated its rules regarding AI-generated content and manipulated media. These changes come after receiving criticism from Meta's Oversight Board, aiming to enhance transparency and provide context to users. This new approach, set to take effect next month, includes the application of ""Made with AI"" badges to deepfakes and additional contextual information for other manipulated content. This article discusses the implications of these changes and how they will impact the content moderation process on Meta's platforms.

Body:
Meta's updated policy will involve labeling a wider range of content, including deepfakes, with a ""Made with AI"" badge. This change will result in more pieces of content being flagged for potentially misleading users, especially during a year with numerous elections worldwide. However, the company will only apply labels to deepfakes with industry-standard AI image indicators or when the uploader has disclosed the content as AI-generated. Content falling outside these criteria will likely remain unlabeled.

Meta's new approach focuses on providing transparency and context instead of removing manipulated media, prioritizing free speech. This strategy is expected to lead to an increase in AI-generated content and manipulated media on Meta's platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. Thus, the company's playbook for AI-generated or manipulated media now entails more labels and fewer takedowns.

In July, Meta will discontinue removing content based on its current manipulated video policy, requiring users to understand the self-disclosure process before implementing the new approach. This change may address increasing legal demands on Meta regarding content moderation and systemic risk, such as the European Union's Digital Services Act.

The Oversight Board, funded by Meta but operating independently, has been critical of Meta's content moderation policies. The Board has reviewed a small percentage of Meta's decisions and provided policy recommendations, which Meta is not obligated to accept. However, in this instance, Meta has agreed to amend its AI-generated content and manipulated media policies based on the Board's feedback.

Social network X has recently announced that its Premium tier subscribers can now interact with the xAI's Grok chatbot. This expansion follows Elon Musk's announcement last month, making the chatbot available to an even wider audience. Until now, only Premium+ users, who pay $16 per month or an annual fee of $168, had access to this innovative feature. However, with the latest update, users subscribing to the $8-per-month Premium plan can also enjoy the benefits of Grok.

Grok offers users two modes to chat: Regular and Fun. As with other Large Language Model (LLM) products, Grok includes labels to indicate when the chatbot might return inaccurate answers. While there have been instances of Grok generating inaccurate summaries, such as writing a fake headline about Iran striking Tel Aviv with heavy missiles, the chatbot primarily focuses on summarizing trending news stories.

X's new explore view inside Grok showcases the chatbot's summaries of top news stories. This feature is similar to offerings from Jeff Bezos and NVIDIA-backed Perplexity AI, making Grok a strong competitor in the market. Users can now access Grok's news summaries from the explore page and the chatbot's home screen.

Musk's decision to expand access to Grok might be a strategic move to rival other popular chatbot products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, or Anthropic’s Claude. Over the past few months, Musk has publicly criticized OpenAI's operations. In March, he went as far as suing the company, alleging a ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goals. OpenAI, in response, filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk's claims while releasing email exchanges between Musk and the company.

In addition to the expanded user base, xAI recently open-sourced Grok but withheld crucial training data details. Although the company has taken this step towards transparency, questions remain about whether this is the latest version of the model and if xAI will provide more information about its approach to developing the model and training data.

Spotify has discontinued its live audio app, but it's making strides to enhance artist-fan engagement through its innovative ""Listening Party"" feature. This exciting feature allows high-engaging fans to join album release events and interact with their favorite artists by asking questions and participating in live chats.

Spotify's Quiet Shift from Live Audio to Listening Parties

The Listening Party feature has been in a testing phase in the U.S. and Indonesia since December 2023, with plans to expand to more markets. Spotify spokespersons have confirmed that artists like Zara Larsson and Bleachers have already tried out this new feature.

How to Participate in a Spotify Listening Party

Listening Parties are accessible through the events section of an artist's profile. While top fans typically receive invitations, any Spotify Premium user can join by finding the listing. Although Spotify hasn't explicitly defined what constitutes a top fan, it likely includes users who have shown a consistent affinity for the artist over time.

Interactive Features of Spotify Listening Parties

Equipped with real-time audio technology, Listening Parties let fans request to join the artist on stage during a session. Additionally, each event has a live chat room for fans to engage with one another. This feature also allows fans to shop artists' latest merchandise while streaming music together with other fans.

Spotify's Growing Fan-Artist Engagement

Spotify has been working on fostering direct engagement between fans and artists, including merchandise sales, events, and ticketing. The company launched an in-app Merch Hub in 2022, offering personalized recommendations for fans to purchase items from their favorite artists.

The Listening Party feature combines elements of group listening and live audio interactions, building on Spotify's Group Session feature, which allows users to listen to songs with friends.

Elon Musk, the enigmatic CEO of Tesla, has announced that a Tesla Robotaxi will be unveiled on August 8. This announcement comes after a Reuters report suggesting that Tesla was abandoning its plans for a $25,000 low-cost EV to focus on a robotaxi.

According to the Reuters report, three anonymous sources and internal documents revealed that Tesla was shifting its resources to develop a robotaxi built on the same platform intended for the low-cost vehicle. Musk quickly dismissed these claims on X, the social network he owns, calling Reuters' report a lie without providing any evidence or disputing specific details.

In the past, Musk has wavered between prioritizing a traditional car or one without a steering wheel or pedals. Despite not yet delivering a fully autonomous car, Tesla has consistently promised autonomous capabilities. In 2016, Musk stated that a Tesla would drive itself cross-country by the end of 2017, but this never materialized. In 2019, he promised to launch the company's first robotaxis and an autonomous ride-sharing network in 2020, yet another goal that Tesla failed to achieve.

Tesla vehicles currently come equipped with a driver-assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $12,000, owners can purchase ""full self-driving"" (FSD), a feature that Musk has long promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. However, it is essential to clarify that Tesla vehicles are not currently self-driving, and FSD features still require the driver's constant supervision and control.

The Tesla Robotaxi, set to be unveiled on August 8, has been a subject of speculation for years. As Tesla has been working on this vehicle, Musk has faced internal resistance, with engineers insisting on including a steering wheel and pedals. To counter this, lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy maintained a more traditional car version as a ""shadow project.""

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/,Price of zero-day exploits rises as companies harden products against hackers," Zero-Day Exploit Prices Soar: Apple, Google, Microsoft Targets Getting Harder to Hack ","Title: The Soaring Value of Zero-Day Exploits: A Hacker's Dilemma

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, the price of zero-day exploits has reached unprecedented heights. Once worth a few thousand dollars, these tools that enable hackers to infiltrate iPhones, Android devices, WhatsApp, iMessage, Chrome, and Safari browsers now fetch millions. This surge in value is a direct result of companies strengthening their products against cybercriminals, making the process of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities increasingly challenging.

Crowdfense, a startup that acquires zero-days to resell to government agencies, recently released its updated price list, revealing a significant increase in payouts compared to its 2019 list. Highlights include:

- $5 to $7 million for iPhone zero-days
- Up to $5 million for Android zero-days
- $3 to $3.5 million for Chrome and Safari zero-days
- $3 to $5 million for WhatsApp and iMessage zero-days

These numbers represent a sharp rise from the previous maximum payouts of $3 million for Android and iOS zero-days.

The escalating prices can be attributed to the growing difficulty in exploiting software and devices. As companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft enhance their security measures, the task of uncovering vulnerabilities becomes increasingly arduous. Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, notes, ""It should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we're using, whatever devices we're using.""

Google's Threat Analysis Group reported 97 zero-day vulnerabilities used in the wild in 2023, with spyware vendors accounting for 75% of zero-days targeting Google products and Android. Spyware providers often collaborate with zero-day brokers, further complicating the landscape.

David Manouchehri, a security analyst familiar with the zero-day market, states, ""Hard targets like Google's Pixel and the iPhone have been becoming harder to hack every year. I expect the cost to continue to increase significantly over time."" Paolo Stagno, director of research at Crowdfense, agrees, citing the impact of mitigations implemented by vendors.

Introduction

In a recent conversation with IVP General Partner Eric Liaw, we discussed the firm's $1.6 billion fundraising, succession at IVP, and the Klarna controversy. This article highlights the key points from our conversation, shedding light on the current venture capital landscape.

Fundraising in a Choppy Market

Despite choppy market conditions, IVP maintained its consistent investment strategy, avoiding rapid capital deployment and excessive fundraising.

IVP and Saudi Arabia: No Capital Ties

IVP has not taken any money from Saudi Arabia, according to Liaw, who did not comment on the firm's LP base.

The London Expansion: Organic Growth

Liaw moved to London eight months ago, as part of IVP's organic growth strategy, which began with their first European investment in 2006.","Title: A Candid Conversation with Eric Liaw of IVP: Fundraising, Succession, and Klarna

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology and venture capital, IVP's recent closing of its 18th fund with $1.6 billion in capital commitments is noteworthy. I had the opportunity to speak with General Partner Eric Liaw, delving into the fundraising process, succession at IVP, and the recent drama surrounding portfolio company Klarna. This piece will highlight the key points from our conversation, offering a unique insight into the current venture capital landscape.

The Fundraising Process in a Choppy Market

When asked if the fundraising process was more or less challenging due to the current market conditions, Liaw described it as a ""choppy period."" He emphasized that IVP has consistently adhered to its strategy, ensuring that capital deployment aligns with their investment approach. This consistency has allowed them to avoid raising excessive amounts of capital and deploying it rapidly, a pitfall that other firms in the industry have experienced.

IVP and Saudi Arabia: No Capital Ties

In response to whether IVP has taken any money from Saudi Arabia, Liaw stated that the firm typically does not comment on its LP base. However, he did confirm that they do not have capital from that region.

The Move to London: An Organic Expansion

Liaw moved to London about eight months ago, following an organic expansion strategy that IVP has been pursuing since their first European investment in 2006. With approximately 20 companies in their European portfolio, spanning 10 different countries, establishing a physical presence in Europe was a logical step for the firm.
