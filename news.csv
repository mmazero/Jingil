Addressing Security and Privacy Concerns in the GenAI Era

The integration of proprietary data with GenAI platforms raises legitimate concerns about privacy and data security. Glean acknowledges these concerns and assures users of its commitment to security and privacy. The platform respects the permissions set in a company's data sources, ensuring that employees only receive answers based on the data they are authorized to access. Additionally, Glean employs robust security measures, including data encryption and regular security audits, to safeguard sensitive information.

Its annual recurring revenue has nearly quadrupled in the past year, and its customer base includes renowned companies like Duolingo, Grammarly, and Sony. This impressive track record has attracted the attention of investors, resulting in a recent $200 million Series D funding round led by Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Conclusion: Glean's Impact on the Future of Work

Glean is poised to revolutionize the way enterprises access and utilize information. Its GenAI-powered platform empowers employees to find the information they need quickly and efficiently, boosting productivity and enhancing the overall employee experience. As Glean continues to expand its capabilities and customer base, it is clear that the platform is a game-changer in the enterprise technology landscape.

Readdle's Spark email client introduced an AI assistant, while tech giants Microsoft and Google have integrated AI capabilities into Outlook and Gmail.

Superhuman's co-founder and CEO, Rahul Vohra, emphasizes the company's unique approach to AI-powered features, highlighting their stickiness and user engagement. On average, Superhuman users leverage AI 25 times weekly to compose emails.

Vohra envisions a three-phase roadmap for Superhuman's AI-powered products. The first phase involves providing an email assistant, the second phase introduces automatic AI functionality without user invocation, and the third phase aims to replace certain aspects of a user's daily workflow, such as scheduling appointments or composing entire emails on their behalf.

While Superhuman's current pricing model remains at $30 per month, Vohra hints at a potential pricing review later this year. The company's focus extends beyond AI, with plans to enhance its team-oriented offerings. Vohra envisions a collaborative email platform that facilitates seamless internal communication, transforming email from a solitary productivity tool into a collaborative hub.

Superhuman is also exploring the development of specialized email clients, such as Superhuman for Sales, tailored to specific roles like account executives and customer managers, with integrations for popular platforms like Salesforce and Hubspot.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/subsets-uses-explainable-ai-to-help-subscription-media-companies-reduce-customer-churn/,Subsets helps subscription businesses reduce churn with 'retention experiments' and explainable AI,"

In the realm of business, recurring revenue reigns supreme. It's the holy grail that companies strive for, the steady stream of income that fuels growth and stability. This is why tech giants like Apple have shifted their focus towards becoming service providers, with a significant portion of their revenue now generated from subscription-based services like Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud.

The allure of recurring revenue is undeniable, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Acquiring new customers has become increasingly expensive, and companies must constantly work to retain their existing subscriber base. Reducing churn, the rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions, is the key to long-term success.

Enter Subsets, a Danish startup that aims to help companies bridge the retention gap in the subscription industry. Founded in 2022, Subsets leverages the power of AI to identify subscribers who are at risk of churning and provides tailored experiments to entice them to stay.

Subsets' secret weapon is explainable AI, a type of AI that can explain its decisions and insights in a way that humans can understand. This is crucial for building trust and ensuring that companies can make informed decisions about their retention strategies.

Since its launch, Subsets has gained traction with notable customers such as the New York Times-owned Athletic and Danish newspaper Børsen. Now, the company has secured $1.65 million in pre-seed funding, led by Nordic early-stage VC Upfin and Y Combinator (YC), to fuel its growth and expand its reach.

Subsets is currently focused on the digital media vertical, helping publishers, streaming platforms, subscription apps, and telecoms retain their subscribers. The company plans to expand into other industries in the future, such as mobility, banking, food delivery, and even offline subscription categories.

To harness the power of Subsets, companies simply connect their internal systems, such as CRM, CMS, billing, and data warehouse, to the platform. Subsets then analyzes subscriber data points, including demographics, content consumption patterns, and interactions with the product, to identify churn risks.

Through an intuitive web app, commercial teams can delve into churn audiences and understand their behavior. Subsets allows non-technical teams to run retention experiments on subsets of their subscriber base to determine which actions effectively reduce churn. These experiments can range from personalized push notifications and email offers to free upgrades and new feature unlocks.

The results of these experiments are presented in a clear and actionable format, allowing companies to automate what works and continuously improve their retention strategies. Subsets' AI algorithms, built using gradient-boosting models and temporal sequencing methods, provide a solid foundation for accurate predictions and effective churn reduction.

While Subsets doesn't currently utilize OpenAI's GPT.x models, the company is exploring ways to incorporate them into its product to enhance its downstream functionality. This aligns with the growing trend among YC companies, with CEO Garry Tan revealing that around half of them are leveraging LLMs in some capacity.

YC's involvement as an early backer is a testament to Subsets' potential. The prestigious accelerator's strong network has already opened doors for the startup, connecting them with potential customers and investors.

Subsets' pre-seed funding round also saw participation from institutional and angel investors, including Cuesta Labs, Sandhill Markets, and Peakon founder Phillip Chambers. With this funding, Subsets is poised to expand its team, enhance its product, and solidify its position as a leader in the subscription retention space.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"

In the realm of the internet, a battle is brewing over the fate of content moderation, with the Supreme Court at the center of it all. Two state laws, one from Florida and the other from Texas, have sparked a heated debate about the role of social media companies in shaping online discourse.

At the heart of the matter lies the question of whether these laws, crafted by Republican lawmakers, infringe upon the First Amendment rights of tech companies and their users. The laws aim to curb social media platforms' ability to remove or restrict content based on political viewpoints, a move seen by some as a response to perceived anti-conservative bias.

However, research has not substantiated these accusations, leaving experts to ponder whether the laws stem from a skewed perception of ideological discrepancies in content moderation decisions. The Supreme Court justices themselves expressed skepticism during oral arguments, raising concerns about the broad nature of the laws and their potential unintended consequences.

The legal landscape surrounding the internet is a tangled web of outdated precedents, leaving both tech companies and their critics craving clarity. The Supreme Court's previous rulings on social media cases have demonstrated the court's reluctance to provide clear-cut answers, leaving the issue in a state of uncertainty.

During the hearing, Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighted the far-reaching implications of the laws, emphasizing the diverse nature of the internet and the potential impact on non-traditional social media platforms. Justice Brett Kavanaugh echoed these concerns, underscoring the importance of the First Amendment's protection against government suppression of speech.

Even Justice Neil Gorsuch, who appeared more receptive to arguments against social networks, pointed to Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for content moderation decisions. He suggested that this law may override the state-imposed restrictions on social media moderation.

The outcome of these cases remains uncertain, with the Supreme Court having the option to issue a decisive ruling or remand the cases back to lower courts for further proceedings. The justices' indecision about the way the cases were brought forward adds another layer of complexity to the already convoluted legal battle.

Regardless of the court's decision, the internet age demands a fresh approach to First Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court must confront the evolving nature of online communication and update its legal framework accordingly. The vast technological changes of the internet era necessitate a modern understanding of free speech and content moderation in the digital realm.

As the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court has a responsibility to provide clarity and guidance in this rapidly evolving landscape. The future of content moderation hangs in the balance, with far-reaching implications for the way we interact and communicate online.

Navigating the Cloud Maze: Unveiling the Hosted Private Cloud

In the ever-evolving world of technology, cloud computing has become an integral part of modern business operations. Yet, amidst the hype and buzz surrounding cloud adoption, many organizations find themselves caught in a dilemma – should they embrace the public cloud, retreat to on-premise infrastructure, or explore a middle ground?

In this blog, we delve into the concept of hosted private cloud (HPC), a compelling solution that offers the best of both worlds – the agility and scalability of the cloud, coupled with the control and security of dedicated infrastructure.

What is a Hosted Private Cloud?

In the realm of digital advertising, a pressing concern has emerged, threatening the very essence of journalism and freedom of expression. South Africa has joined the chorus of nations demanding transparency from tech giants like Google, seeking answers to how much information and revenue they derive from news publishers.

Caxton, a prominent media organization in South Africa, along with the Centre for Free Expression, has taken a bold step by serving Google with legal demands. Their aim is to obtain clear and transparent answers to a series of well-considered questions that delve into Google's practices and the impact they have on the news industry.

The crux of the matter lies in the nature of programmatic advertising, which, according to Caxton's chairman, Paul Jenkins, fails to distinguish between genuine news and disinformation, real users and click farms. This indiscriminate approach undermines the value of authentic journalism, leading to a situation where ""news as a public good and freedom of expression is at a tipping point.""

Caxton's demands center around the publisher's content and Google's utilization of it. These questions echo the concerns of media organizations worldwide, who face a maze of confidentiality protections that shield secretive entities like Google from accountability.

Jenkins emphasizes their resolve to leverage South Africa's constitution to safeguard their rights to freedom of expression and information. They reject the notion that commercial confidentiality can be used as an excuse for secrecy.

Studies have revealed the significant financial implications for news publishers due to the dominance of tech giants. Last year, academics estimated that US publishers are owed billions of dollars annually by Google and Meta. The tech giants' argument that news is not essential and that publishers benefit from their platforms driving traffic is seen as a deflection from their responsibility to fairly compensate content creators.

Furthermore, a study in Switzerland found that Google generates a substantial portion of its revenue from media content, highlighting the value of news beyond what policymakers and publishers often perceive.

In South Africa, programmatic advertising has had a detrimental impact on the media industry. The cost-per-impression for programmatic ads is extremely low, with publishers receiving a mere fraction of the advertising revenue. This unsustainable business model, coupled with the limited reach of subscription or paywall models, threatens the survival of local media outlets.

Programmatic advertising has become a pervasive force in the marketing world, often accepted without critical evaluation. However, its metrics have been repeatedly called into question, with instances of inflated or misrepresented data. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of programmatic advertising and the validity of the metrics used to measure its success.

The dominance of tech platforms has led to calls for regulations and legislative measures to ensure fair compensation for news publishers. Australia's News Media Bargaining Code and similar legislation in Canada serve as examples of efforts to address this imbalance.

Caxton's actions reflect the broader struggle of media organizations grappling with the digital revolution and the encroachment of tech behemoths. The average American now spends seven hours a day on a screen, highlighting the profound impact of digital media on society.

As Jenkins aptly states, ""Journalism is in danger."" The erosion of genuine news and the challenges faced by media organizations demand urgent attention and collective action to preserve the integrity of journalism and freedom of expression in the digital age.
