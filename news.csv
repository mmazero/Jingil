From November 2023, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, will force users in the European Union to agree to be tracked and profiled for its ad targeting business, or else pay a monthly subscription to access ad-free versions of its services.

However, the EDPB, which is composed of representatives of data protection authorities from around the EU, has stated that adopting a binary ""consent or pay"" model is not viable. The guidance emphasizes the need for platforms to provide users with a ""real choice"" over their privacy.

The EDPB's opinion, which runs to 42 pages, states that online platforms such as Meta should not confront users with a choice between consenting to the processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes and paying a fee. Instead, platforms should provide an equivalent alternative that does not entail the payment of a fee.

The EDPB defines large platforms as entities designated as very large online platforms under the EU's Digital Services Act or gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act. The Board states that other core principles of the GDPR, such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and fairness, continue to apply around consent mechanisms.

The board recommends that large online platforms consider compliance with the principles of necessity and proportionality and that they are responsible for demonstrating that their processing is generally in line with the GDPR.

Meta has been reviewing its consent model since last year, and a spokesman for the company emailed a brief statement playing down the guidance. According to the statement, the subscriptions model is a legally valid way for companies to seek people's consent for personalized advertising, and the guidance does not alter the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

In conclusion, the EDPB's guidance on consent or pay models is a significant development in the regulation of adtech giants like Meta. While Meta may feel confident that nothing will change in the short-term, it is clear that EU regulators will need to analyze and ingest the advice before taking any action.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dripping-meta-logo.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-17 18:06:49,"""EDPB: Adtech Giants Must Offer Real Privacy Choices, Not 'Consent or Pay.'
