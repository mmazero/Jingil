EU Cracks Down on Meta's Privacy Fee, Demanding Compliance with Digital Rules

The European Union (EU) has issued a stern warning to Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, regarding its controversial ""consent or pay"" tactic. This tactic forces European users to choose between paying a monthly subscription or agreeing to data tracking.

The EU's digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, has expressed skepticism about Meta's privacy fee, stating that there are alternative ways to monetize services without relying on targeted advertising. She emphasized the importance of continuing dialogue with Meta and assessing their compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The DMA aims to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies and prevent unfair practices. Meta has been designated as a ""gatekeeper"" under the DMA, and its core platform services, including social networks and advertising, are subject to ex ante competition rules.

The EU has also raised concerns about Meta's compliance with the Digital Services Act (DSA), which includes rules for very large online platforms (VLOPs). Both Facebook and Instagram fall under this category. The DSA requires platforms to obtain consent for data processing, and Meta's ""consent or pay"" mechanism has been met with criticism from privacy advocates.

The EU has sent a formal request for information to Meta regarding its compliance with the DSA. The Commission is investigating whether Meta's subscription option violates transparency and risk assessment obligations. The Commission has also highlighted the prohibition on targeted advertising for minors under the DSA.

Meta maintains that its privacy fee complies with EU laws, but consumer protection groups argue that it breaches EU consumer protection and privacy rules. They contend that the pricing is disproportionate and amounts to economic coercion, preventing users from exercising their right to privacy.

Vestager's comments suggest that the EU believes Meta's privacy fee violates the DMA. The DMA carries heavier penalties than the DSA or GDPR, and the Commission has indicated that it will not hesitate to take enforcement action.

The EU's stance sends a clear message to Big Tech companies that they must abide by the spirit and letter of digital governance laws. The EU is committed to protecting user privacy and preventing anti-competitive practices that stifle innovation and consumer choice.

SpaceX's Spaceport Expansion: Paving the Way for More Astronaut Launches

Get ready for a new era of space exploration as SpaceX prepares to unveil its second launch pad certified for astronaut missions. This significant upgrade will alleviate congestion and empower the company to send even more humans into the cosmos.

The Current Launch Landscape

SpaceX has already executed 13 successful crewed missions, all of which have taken off from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. However, the company has long envisioned expanding its launch capacity by bringing another pad online.

SLC-40: The Next Frontier

Enter SLC-40, a neighboring launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, which is nearing completion. SpaceX has diligently installed a crew access arm to the launch tower, providing astronauts with a safe passage to the Crew Dragon spacecraft. Additionally, a cutting-edge emergency egress system has been implemented, featuring a long, bright orange slide that allows the crew to evacuate swiftly in the event of an emergency.

Scaling Up for the Future

This new infrastructure is a testament to SpaceX's ambitious plans. As VP of Launch Kiko Dontchev notes, it will enable the company to ""scale to bigger towers and spaceships."" The ultimate goal? To transport up to 100 people aboard their Starship spacecraft.

Cargo Mission as a Stepping Stone

Before astronaut launches can resume, SpaceX will conduct a crucial cargo resupply mission known as CRS-30. This mission, part of a series of routine cargo deliveries to the International Space Station (ISS), is scheduled for tomorrow.

Incremental Progress

According to Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's VP of build and flight reliability, the cargo flight is an essential step towards astronaut launches. Both cargo and crew missions utilize variations of the Dragon spacecraft. ""We would like to do a cargo flight first if we can,"" he explains. ""We think CRS-30 is probably the right time to do that.""

Conclusion

SpaceX's unwavering commitment to innovation and expansion is evident in the development of SLC-40. This second launch pad will not only enhance safety but also pave the way for more frequent astronaut missions. As the company continues to push the boundaries of space exploration, we eagerly anticipate the next chapter in human spaceflight.

Solana: The Silent Giant Making Waves in Crypto

In the bustling world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the headlines. But recently, a lesser-known blockchain called Solana has emerged as a stealthy force, making waves and attracting attention.

Solana's Rise to Prominence

Solana has been quietly gaining momentum, with its native token, SOL, experiencing a surge in value. This price appreciation has caught the eye of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. So, what's behind Solana's sudden rise?

A Return to the Past

The key to Solana's success lies not in groundbreaking innovation, but rather in a nostalgic return to the playful and lighthearted spirit of crypto's early days. Enter Dogwifhat and Bonk, two seemingly nonsensical words that have become synonymous with Solana's recent price surge.

The Power of Community

Dogwifhat and Bonk represent a community-driven movement within the Solana ecosystem. They have created a sense of camaraderie and excitement, fueling the token's value. While some may question the sustainability of such a price pump, it's undeniable that the community behind Solana is having a blast.

Substance vs. Hype

However, it's important to question whether the current crypto boom has the same substance as previous bull markets. Without significant technological advancements, there's a risk that this summer's rally could lack the staying power of past booms.

Conclusion

Solana's rise is a testament to the enduring power of community and the allure of the unknown in the world of crypto. While it remains to be seen whether Solana's momentum will continue, it's a reminder that the crypto landscape is constantly evolving and that even the most unexpected players can make their mark.

Greenly: Empowering Businesses with Carbon Accounting

The race to combat climate change has gained momentum, with corporations setting ambitious net-zero emission targets. These goals have had a ripple effect, influencing companies throughout the supply chain. However, smaller businesses often lack the resources to track their carbon emissions effectively.

Enter Greenly, a Paris-based startup that has developed carbon accounting software tailored to the needs of small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs). Greenly's software seamlessly integrates with customer data, including utility bills, freight records, cloud usage, and financial information. Using proprietary algorithms, it calculates carbon emissions by category and scope, providing businesses with a comprehensive understanding of their environmental impact.

""We've made it our mission to help SMBs navigate these new sustainability obligations at an affordable price,"" says Greenly's CEO, Alexis Normand.

Greenly's success is evident in its rapid growth. The company has achieved over $10 million in annual recurring revenue and aims to double that figure each year. To fuel this expansion, Greenly recently secured a $52 million Series B investment led by Fidelity International Strategic Ventures.

Beyond company-level carbon accounting, Greenly is venturing into life cycle assessments for individual products. These assessments, which can be time-consuming and complex, are becoming increasingly important in industries such as manufacturing, garment, and construction.

Greenly's automated approach simplifies this process, enabling smaller companies to conduct comprehensive assessments quickly and efficiently. ""In some sectors, it's becoming a requirement,"" explains Normand. ""Companies can't sell to major players like General Motors or Ford without providing carbon footprints for every component.""

Greenly's Series B funding is a significant milestone for climate tech startups, which often face challenges in securing funding beyond the early stages. This investment underscores the growing interest in climate tech among venture capitalists, recognizing the market demand for businesses focused on sustainability.

Greenly's success is a testament to the power of SaaS in the climate tech space. By applying this well-established business model to sustainability, Greenly has made carbon accounting accessible to businesses of all sizes. As the world continues to prioritize environmental responsibility, Greenly is well-positioned to empower businesses in their journey towards net-zero emissions.

Candela Cruises into the Future with Electric Boats

Electric boat manufacturer Candela is making waves with a fresh infusion of $25 million in funding and the launch of its commercial P-12 ferry in New Zealand. This investment fuels Candela's global aspirations, as the company continues to expand its fleet of highly efficient electric vessels.

Candela has steadily increased the size of its boats, starting with the C-7 and C-8 models. Now, the company boasts a fleet of 70 vessels, including the P-12, a ferry designed to carry up to 30 passengers. The P-12 recently embarked on its maiden voyage, transporting passengers across Lake Manapōuri in New Zealand. This scenic destination is also home to the country's largest hydroelectric power station, making the P-12's clean operation even more significant. By replacing traditional diesel-powered ferries, the P-12 is projected to slash emissions by an impressive 240 tons annually, preserving the lake's pristine environment.

Candela's innovative boats have garnered international attention, attracting the investment of Groupe Beneteau, a boating industry giant with over a century of experience. Groupe Beneteau's CEO, Bruno Thivoyon, emphasized the alignment with their ""ecological transition objectives"" and the company's commitment to sustainable boating solutions.

Many established boating companies are embracing electric propulsion and advanced technologies. Collaborations between these legacy players and emerging innovators like Candela are proving mutually beneficial. Smaller companies gain access to resources and market reach, while larger companies acquire ready-to-deploy technologies.

Candela's boats employ hydrofoils and electric engines mounted on the hull. Once a certain speed is reached, the boats effectively ""fly"" above the water's surface, significantly reducing energy consumption. This approach requires a sophisticated autopilot system for stability, but the advantages of reduced energy usage and emissions outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Candela is not alone in pursuing the electric boat market. Navier is also making waves with its coastal transit solutions, while Zin Boats continues to develop its next-generation vessel.

The $25 million funding round was led by Groupe Beneteau, with participation from EQT Ventures, Ocean Zero LLC, and Kan Dela AB. This investment will fuel Candela's continued growth and innovation, as the company sets its sights on revolutionizing the boating industry with its clean and efficient electric vessels.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/farm-to-feed-cutting-food-loss/,Farm to Feed is cutting food loss and creating data platform to better farming outcomes," Farm to Feed: Empowering Kenyan Farmers, Reducing Food Loss with Data ","

Tackling Food Loss: Farm to Feed Empowers Kenyan Farmers

In the global food system, a staggering third of produce goes to waste. Kenya faces a similar challenge, with food loss accounting for 20-40% of its agricultural output. Small-scale farmers, who produce the bulk of Kenya's food, bear the brunt of this loss due to limited market access and stringent cosmetic standards.

Bridging the Market Gap

To address this issue, innovative startups like Farm to Feed are emerging. This agri-tech platform connects farmers with businesses, creating a vital market for imperfect produce that would otherwise go unsold. Farm to Feed aggregates produce from farmers, including those considered too small, too large, or oddly shaped, and sells them to restaurants and food processors through its online marketplace and other sales channels.

From Non-Profit to Commercial Enterprise

Farm to Feed's journey began in 2021 when its founders, Claire Van Enk, Anouk Boertien, and Zara Benosa, pivoted from a non-profit program that provided food during the COVID-19 lockdown. They recognized the urgent need for market access for farmers and launched Farm to Feed to tackle food loss on a larger scale.

Empowering Farmers, Reducing Food Waste

Farm to Feed aggregates produce from farmers in key regions of Kenya, sorts and grades it, and delivers it to clients in Nairobi. The startup's efforts not only reduce food waste but also empower farmers by providing them with a reliable market for their produce.

Sustainable Solutions and Funding

Farm to Feed employs sustainable practices, including using leased trucks with cooling solutions. The startup has secured $1 million in funding from investors and institutions, enabling it to expand its operations and explore new revenue streams.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/reddit-prices-ipo-at-34-per-share-the-top-of-the-range/,"Reddit prices IPO at $34 per share, the top of the range"," Reddit IPO Priced at $34, Valued at $5.4 Billion ","

Reddit's IPO: A Social Media Giant's Journey to the Stock Market

Reddit, the beloved social media platform, has made its grand debut on the New York Stock Exchange, pricing its shares at $34 each. This move marks the culmination of a highly anticipated IPO process that has captivated the investment world.

A Strong Start

Reddit's IPO was a resounding success, with the company raising nearly $500 million. This impressive feat reflects the immense excitement surrounding the company's future prospects. Excluding employee stock options, Reddit's valuation now stands at $5.4 billion, a significant milestone for the 19-year-old company.

The Tech Market's Rollercoaster

While Reddit's IPO valuation may seem modest compared to its previous $10 billion private market value, it's important to note the recent fluctuations in the tech market. The boom that propelled many tech companies to dizzying heights has subsided, leading to a more cautious approach among investors.

A Game-Changer for VC-Backed Companies

Reddit's successful IPO is a beacon of hope for other venture capital-backed companies eagerly awaiting their own public debuts. If Reddit's stock performs well in its early days, it could embolden other companies to follow suit, invigorating the IPO market.

Profitability Concerns

Despite Reddit's impressive revenue growth, the company still faces the challenge of profitability. In 2023, it reported net losses exceeding $90 million. This could raise concerns among investors who are increasingly demanding profitability from newly traded companies.

AI as a Revenue Lifeline

However, Reddit's involvement in the burgeoning AI industry could provide a lifeline for its revenue growth. The company has already begun selling its data to Google for AI model training, and similar licensing agreements could become a significant revenue stream in the future.

Conclusion

Reddit's IPO is a testament to the enduring power of social media and the potential for tech companies to adapt and thrive in a changing market landscape. While profitability remains a concern, the company's strong user base, innovative revenue streams, and participation in the AI boom position it well for long-term success. As Reddit embarks on its journey as a publicly traded company, it will undoubtedly face challenges, but its loyal community and ambitious vision will serve as its guiding stars.

Silence: A New Force in Climate Tech Investment

In the realm of climate tech, a new player has emerged, poised to shake things up: Silence. This angel-style venture capital firm has raised an impressive $35 million, eager to make waves in the industry.

The Visionary Behind Silence

Borja Moreno de los Rios, a seasoned venture capitalist, is the driving force behind Silence. His passion for the environment, nurtured from a young age, has led him to dedicate his expertise to climate tech investment.

A Unique Investment Approach

Silence's investment strategy is designed to empower climate startups. Unlike traditional venture capital firms, Silence doesn't aim to lead rounds or secure board seats. Instead, they adopt an angel investor approach, offering larger ticket sizes. This approach allows them to remain neutral and unbiased, supporting promising startups without competing with established VC funds.

A Diverse Portfolio

Since its inception, Silence has invested in 22 diverse companies, spanning various sectors of climate tech. These companies are pushing boundaries in virtual power plants, energy management, home energy optimization, solar financing, and circularity.

Case Study: Cardino

One notable investment is Cardino, a used electric vehicle marketplace. Silence's early-stage investment played a crucial role in Cardino's rapid growth, leading to a subsequent seed round led by Point Nine. This success story highlights Silence's ability to identify and support promising startups.

The Silence Team

Borja is joined by a team of tech and climate experts, including Sara Ramos Colmenarejo, Guilherme Penna, and Brendan Hayes. Their combined experience brings a wealth of knowledge to the table, enabling Silence to make informed investment decisions.

Limited Partners

Silence's limited partners include renowned venture capitalists and successful founders, reflecting the firm's strong reputation and credibility within the industry.

A Focus on Practical Solutions

Unlike some climate funds, Silence prioritizes investments in SaaS and marketplaces. Borja believes that these investments offer a more tangible and immediate impact on climate change than long-term moonshot projects.

Conclusion

Silence is a refreshing force in the climate tech investment landscape. With its unique approach, experienced team, and diverse portfolio, Silence is poised to accelerate the development of innovative solutions to the climate crisis. As the firm continues to make strategic investments, it will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping the future of climate tech.

Mermaid Chart: Revolutionizing Diagramming with Open Source and AI

Mermaid, the beloved open source diagramming tool, has embarked on an exciting new chapter with the launch of Mermaid Chart, a hosted service that empowers users to create stunning diagrams and charts. This venture is the brainchild of Knut Sveidqvist, the founder of Mermaid, who was inspired by a lost Microsoft Visio file.

The Rise of Mermaid: From Humble Beginnings to Global Popularity

Mermaid's journey began as a Markdown-like language for creating diagrams. Sveidqvist's frustration with redrawing lost Visio files sparked the idea for a text-based solution. Over time, Mermaid evolved to support various diagram types, capturing the attention of the developer community.

Open Core Ventures: A Catalyst for Growth

In 2022, Open Core Ventures (OCV), led by GitLab founder Sid Sijbrandij, recognized Mermaid's potential. OCV paired Sveidqvist with Andrew Firestone, an experienced entrepreneur, as CEO. Together, they established Mermaid Chart, a company that builds hosted services around the open source project.

$7.5 Million Seed Funding: Fueling Innovation

Mermaid Chart recently announced a $7.5 million seed funding round led by OCV, Sequoia, and Microsoft's M12 fund. This investment will accelerate the development of Mermaid's services and expand its reach to a broader audience.

Beyond Developers: Empowering Non-Technical Users

While Mermaid has traditionally catered to developers, Mermaid Chart aims to democratize diagramming by making it accessible to non-technical users. The company is developing user-friendly tools to address the needs of this growing market.

A Vision for Process Automation

Mermaid Chart's ambition extends beyond diagramming. The company envisions a future where its tools become a vital knowledge base, enabling businesses to automate complex processes. This grand vision is still in its early stages, but the potential is undeniable.

Bridging the Gap: Text-Based and Visual Interfaces

Recognizing the accessibility challenges of text-based tools, Mermaid Chart offers an optional visual editor. Users can seamlessly switch between text and visual interfaces, catering to both preferences.

AI-Powered Enhancements: Simplifying Diagramming

To further enhance accessibility, Mermaid Chart has trained an AI model that assists users in creating charts through a chat interface. For paying subscribers, the AI can even correct syntax errors, making diagramming a breeze.

Industry Endorsement: A Testament to Mermaid's Value

Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and CEO of GitLab, hailed Mermaid's open-core approach and its potential to transform business processes. He emphasized the company's use of AI as a catalyst for innovation and the significant opportunities that lie ahead.

Conclusion

Mermaid Chart is poised to revolutionize the way we create and use diagrams. Its open-core foundation, coupled with AI-powered enhancements and a focus on non-technical users, sets it apart from competitors. As the company continues to grow, we can expect even more innovative features and a wider impact on the world of diagramming and process automation.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/x-launches-top-up-packs-for-its-developer-api/,X launches top up packs for its developer API, X's API Top-Up Packs: Empowering Developers with Data Flexibility ,"

Unlocking the Power of Social Media Data: X's New API Top-Up Packs

In a move to empower developers and enhance access to its vast data trove, X (formerly Twitter) has introduced a new set of top-up packs for its developer API program. These paid upgrades provide developers with the flexibility to extend their monthly tweet fetching limits, unlocking even more possibilities for data analysis and app development.

Addressing the Limit Conundrum

Previously, developers faced a frustrating dilemma when they reached their monthly API tier limits. They were left with the choice of waiting out the month or upgrading to a costlier tier. The introduction of top-up packs eliminates this roadblock, allowing developers to seamlessly continue fetching tweets without interruption.

Tiered Access and Usage Caps

The top-up packs come with tiered pricing and usage caps. Developers with the basic tier can purchase up to 10 top-ups per month, while Pro tier developers are limited to 5 top-ups. Each top-up grants an additional 10,000 tweets for a cost of $100.

Impact on the Developer Ecosystem

X's API changes have had a significant impact on the third-party developer ecosystem. Many tools and applications that relied on the platform's data have had to adapt or seek alternative sources. The introduction of top-up packs offers a glimmer of hope for developers, providing them with a way to maintain access to the valuable data they need.

Research and the DSA

The API changes also affected researchers who study the platform's data. However, X was compelled to open up access to researchers in the European Union due to the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA) regulations. This move highlights the importance of data accessibility for research and public discourse.

Conclusion

X's new API top-up packs strike a balance between monetizing its platform and supporting the developer community. By providing developers with a flexible and cost-effective way to extend their data access, X is fostering innovation and empowering researchers to delve deeper into the platform's dynamics. As the social media landscape continues to evolve, these top-up packs will play a crucial role in shaping the future of data analysis and app development.

Navigating the EV Repair Maze: AmberCare to the Rescue

As electric vehicles (EVs) gain popularity, so does the need for reliable and affordable repair options. Amber, a Bay Area startup, is stepping up to address this challenge, starting with Tesla owners.

Introducing AmberCare: A Lifeline for Aging EVs

AmberCare is a groundbreaking aftermarket warranty product designed specifically for Tesla Model Y, 3, S, and X owners. With plans ranging from $40 to $120 per month, AmberCare provides peace of mind by covering critical components like drive units and batteries.

When the unexpected happens, AmberCare simplifies the repair process. The company partners with qualified repair shops to source the right parts and fix the issue, even arranging transportation for the vehicle.

The Uncharted Territory of EV Repairs

The EV market is still in its early stages, and so is the understanding of how these vehicles perform over time. Unlike traditional cars, EVs require specialized knowledge and parts that many auto shops may not have.

This vacuum has led to inflated repair costs or even recommendations to scrap damaged EVs. Existing extended warranty products often fall short in covering EV-specific components.

Amber's Vision: A Comprehensive EV Aftermarket Solution

Amber's mission is to create a vertically integrated aftermarket warranty platform that addresses all these gaps. The company is building a network of repair shops, identifying high-demand parts, and investing in seed funding to achieve its goals.

Launching AmberCare in 10 States

AmberCare is initially available in 10 states, with plans to expand to California by the end of the year. The company is targeting two main customer groups:

 Buyers of used EVs who want to mitigate repair risks
 Tesla owners whose original warranty has expired

Overcoming the Extended Warranty Stigma

Pak, Amber's CEO, acknowledges the negative perception associated with extended warranties. However, he believes that AmberCare's unique offering and transparent approach will resonate with customers.

Unexpected Challenges and Solutions

Repairing EVs presents unique challenges, such as the need for flatbed tow trucks. AmberCare addresses these issues by partnering with specialized transportation providers.

A Growing EV Ecosystem

AmberCare is part of a growing ecosystem of businesses dedicated to the used EV market. These companies are addressing battery recycling, digital maintenance, and other aspects of EV ownership.

Conclusion

AmberCare is a game-changer for Tesla owners and the EV market as a whole. By providing affordable and comprehensive warranty coverage, Amber is empowering drivers to embrace the future of transportation with confidence.

Glassdoor's Anonymity Concerns: A Breach of Trust?

Glassdoor, a popular platform for anonymous company reviews, has sparked alarm among its users after allegations emerged that the company has been collecting and adding their real names to their profiles without their consent.

The Monica Incident

One user, known as Monica, shared her experience on her personal blog. She claimed that Glassdoor added her full name and city to her profile after she emailed customer support. Despite never providing her name during her initial sign-up years ago, Monica accused Glassdoor of extracting it from her email address.

Monica repeatedly protested, emphasizing that Glassdoor lacked her permission. However, the company maintained that adding her name was ""required"" and would not compromise her anonymity for past reviews. Monica expressed concerns about potential data breaches or legal demands that could expose her identity.

User Concerns and Glassdoor's Response

Monica's story has raised alarm among Glassdoor users, who fear that their own anonymity may be at risk. They worry that data collected about them could be added to their profiles without their knowledge or consent.

Glassdoor has long allowed anonymous sign-ups. However, after acquiring Fishbowl, a semi-anonymous social network, Glassdoor updated its terms of service to require all users to verify their identities. This move has raised concerns about whether Glassdoor's commitment to user anonymity is waning.

Expert Opinion

Aaron Mackey, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concerns about Glassdoor's new policies. He believes that the company's collection of additional user data could make it easier to identify users, even if their information is not sought by employers or law enforcement.

Data Accuracy Issues

In some cases, the data added to user profiles has been inaccurate. Josh Simmons, another Glassdoor user, reported that his profile contained a mix of correct and incorrect information, suggesting that the data may have been scraped or obtained from a data broker.

Glassdoor's Stance

Glassdoor has not provided clear answers to questions about how it verifies the accuracy of the information it collects or how it can be used or obtained. The company's spokesperson issued a boilerplate statement emphasizing its commitment to user anonymity.

Users' Dilemma

Monica's experience has left users with a dilemma. They can either accept having their names on their profiles or delete their accounts. Monica chose to delete hers, but it's important to note that this only deactivates the account. To fully delete your Glassdoor account, you must submit a data request form.

Conclusion

Glassdoor's recent actions have raised concerns about the safety and anonymity of its users. The company's collection of additional user data, coupled with its vague responses to questions about data accuracy and usage, has eroded trust among its user base. Users should carefully consider the potential risks and take steps to protect their privacy if they choose to continue using Glassdoor.
