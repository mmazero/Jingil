Introduction

The era of humanoid robots is upon us, and the potential for these machines to revolutionize various industries is immense. However, before we can fully integrate human cognitive skills with humanoid capabilities, there is a need to create an effective interface between humans and humanoid robots. A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University has taken the first step in this direction by developing Human2HumanOid (H 2 O), a real-time whole-body teleoperation system using just an RGB camera.

The Challenge of Teleoperation

Teleoperation, or the effective operation of robots from a distance, has the potential to allow humans to complete a wide range of manual tasks remotely. This includes risky and complex procedures, as well as the compilation of human motion datasets for training humanoid robots in new tasks. However, achieving full-body teleoperation of robots in real-time is a challenging task. The bodies of humanoid robots often do not allow them to replicate human motions involving different limbs, and existing model-based controllers do not always produce realistic movements in robots.

The H 2 O Solution

H 2 O is a scalable and efficient method that allows researchers to compile large datasets of human motions and retarget these motions to humanoid robots, enabling humans to teleoperate them in real-time and reproduce all their body movements on the robot. The H 2 O teleoperation framework is based on reinforcement learning (RL) and consists of the following components:

1. Retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities through a novel 'sim-to-data' methodology, ensuring the motions are feasible for the humanoid's physical constraints.
2. A refined motion dataset that trains an RL-based motion imitator in simulation, which is subsequently transferred to the real robot without further adjustment.

Despite its minimal hardware requirements, H 2 O allows robots to perform a wide array of dynamic whole-body motions in real-time. The input footage used to teleoperate robots is collected using a standard RGB camera, and the system's other components include a retargeting algorithm, a method to clean human motion data in simulations, and a reinforcement learning-based model that learns new",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-scalable-reinforceme.jpg,2024-04-06 08:30:01,Meta Description: Experience real-time humanoid robot teleoperation with H , Real-time teleoperation ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

Amazon has covertly launched a new store called ""Bazaar"" in India, offering affordable and trendy fashion and lifestyle products. This move intensifies Amazon's competition against Walmart-owned Flipkart and Reliance's Ajio, both of which have made significant inroads in India's burgeoning fast-fashion market. Let's delve into the details of this new development and what it means for the e-commerce industry in India.

The Birth of Bazaar: Amazon's Latest Venture

Amazon's Bazaar store quietly made its debut on the India Android app. The e-commerce giant began onboarding sellers in February, promising them hassle-free delivery, zero referral fees, and access to a vast customer base. Bazaar offers a wide array of products, from clothing, accessories, and jewelry to handbags, shoes, traditional and western wear, kitchenware, towels, bed linens, and decor items.

Fast-Fashion's Rapid Growth in India

The popularity of affordable fast-fashion is driving purchases on many Indian shopping apps. According to a Bernstein report, India's e-commerce market has undergone a shift, with mobile and consumer electronics share declining. Fashion has experienced the strongest growth since FY19 and currently holds the highest category share.

Bazaar's Offerings and Pricing

Bazaar's offerings include trendy t-shirts starting at 129 Indian rupees ($1.55) and sneakers priced under $3. These competitive prices enable Bazaar to attract price-conscious Indian consumers who are increasingly embracing fast-fashion.

Amazon's Investment in India

India is a critical overseas market for Amazon, which has invested over $11 billion in the country to date. Despite AWS maintaining its market-leading position in India, Amazon's e-commerce arm lags behind Flipkart. Last year, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, announced plans to invest $12.7 billion in AWS in India by 2030, along with a commitment of","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1169388446.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 18:49:01," Meta Description under 20 word: Affordable Fashion at Amazon's Bazaar.

Instagram's Threads, Meta's answer to Twitter, misses crucial trending opportunity with NYC/NJ earthquake. earthquake dominated Twitter trends, while earthquake-related terms absent on Threads until late. Learn why Threads lags in real-time trend tracking and user experience.","Instagram's Threads: A Work in Progress

Instagram Threads, Meta's response to Twitter, has yet to find its footing. The text-focused social network missed a significant opportunity to shine when users flocked to Twitter to discuss the earthquake in the New York/New Jersey area. earthquake quickly became a top trend on Twitter, while earthquake-related terms were absent from Threads' trends section until much later in the day.

Despite discussions taking place on Threads, the platform failed to reflect the earthquake as a top trend. This is partly because Threads does not use hashtags, which are instrumental in surfacing popular topics on other platforms. Instead, Threads users have adopted the convention of ""[term] Threads"" for tagging. This inconsistency in tagging may dilute the impact of trending topics, as various versions of the same term gain traction simultaneously.

When questioned about the absence of the earthquake from Threads' top trends, a representative from Instagram explained that trends are based on national conversations, and regional events may take longer to gain traction. However, this lag in real-time trend tracking could hinder Threads' ability to compete with Twitter.

Moreover, Meta's decision to distance itself from political content may further limit Threads' potential. Twitter's founders recognized the platform's power to deliver real-time information, making it a hub for journalists and breaking news. In contrast, Threads may struggle to replicate this dynamic.

Twitter's early days offer a compelling example of the platform's potential. In 2006, an earthquake in San Francisco allowed both founders and users to understand Twttr's (early Twitter's name) potential for delivering real-time information and fostering a shared experience. Despite usage declines, Twitter has remained ""stickier"" than anticipated, even in the face of numerous competitors, including Threads.

However, Threads has already shown signs of failing to deliver a consistent user experience. As Max Read noted in a newsletter, the platform can feel random and chaotic, with a wide variety of posts appearing in users' For You feeds.

In conclusion, while Threads has made progress with its 130 million monthly active users, it still has work to do to compete with Twitter.

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, the value of zero-day exploits has skyrocketed. Zero-day exploits are hacking tools that take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in software, which are unknown to the makers of that software. A startup called Crowdfense recently published its updated price list for these valuable hacking tools, revealing millions of dollars up for grabs.

Companies like Crowdfense and its competitor Zerodium aim to acquire zero-day exploits and resell them to government agencies and contractors, who claim they need these tools for tracking and spying on criminals. With the increased difficulty in hacking devices and apps, the prices for these exploits have risen significantly.

Crowdfense is now offering between $5 and $7 million for zero-days to break into iPhones, up to $5 million for Android zero-days, up to $3.5 million for Chrome and Safari exploits, and $3 to $5 million for WhatsApp and iMessage zero-days. When comparing Crowdfense's previous price list, published in 2019, the highest payouts for Android and iOS zero-days were only $3 million.

The increase in prices comes as companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft make it harder to hack their devices and apps, protecting their users. Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, explains, ""It should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software we're using, whatever devices we're using.""

Google's Threat Analysis Group, which tracks hackers and zero-day exploits, reported that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild in 2023. Spyware vendors, often working with zero-day brokers, were responsible for 75% of zero-days targeting Google products and Android.

People in the zero-day industry agree that exploiting vulnerabilities is becoming more challenging. Security analyst David Manouchehri reports that ""hard targets like Google's Pixel and the iPhone have been becoming harder to hack every year.""

In response to user feedback, Snapchat modifies its 'Solar System' feature to minimize potential distress. Initially designed for Snapchat+ subscribers, the feature now turns off by default. This change aims to maintain a balance between providing desired features and minimizing negative impacts on users' feelings.","Title: Snapchat Adjusts ""Solar System"" Feature in Response to User Feedback

In an effort to address concerns regarding a feature that may exacerbate anxiety among its users, Snapchat has modified its ""Solar System"" feature. This adjustment comes after The Wall Street Journal reported on how the feature was contributing to teens' anxiety.

The ""Solar System"" feature, initially designed for Snapchat+ subscribers, displays the position of paid subscribers in their friends' contact lists based on communication frequency. For example, a friend in the ""Mercury"" position would be someone a user communicates with often, while ""Uranus"" would represent a less frequently contacted friend.

Although this feature may appear harmless, it can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings when users realize they're not as close to their friends as they thought. Snapchat acknowledged the feedback and addressed the issue in a post on its newsroom on Friday: ""We've heard and understand that the Solar System can make that feeling worse, and we want to avoid that.""

Instead of eliminating the feature altogether, Snapchat has opted to turn it off by default. Subscribers can still enable the feature if they wish, allowing them to maintain a balance between providing a desired feature and minimizing potential distress for those who do not want to participate.

While Snapchat claims that the ""Solar System"" feature is not widely used, with less than 0.25% of the community utilizing the option, this statistic may not accurately reflect its popularity among Snapchat+ users. Additionally, some users have reported that discovering they're not a friend's top contact has led to difficult conversations and emotional distress.

Snapchat introduced the ""Solar System"" feature as a way to offer users more insight into their friendships, providing ""additional awareness and context."" However, critics argue that such features are intentionally designed to keep young users engaged and attached to the app, potentially contributing to psychological harm and addiction.

Snapchat's Solar System is only one of several friend ranking systems offered by the platform. The app also includes a private feature called ""Best Friends,"" which highlights the most frequently contacted individuals with a heart or smiley emoji at the top of the user's contact list.

At a Stanford event hosted by the university's business school, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared his thoughts on managing a large tech company and fostering innovation within it. This appearance was particularly noteworthy given Google's recent challenges in catching up to Microsoft-backed OpenAI in the generative AI race and the controversial outcomes of Alphabet's Gemini LLM.

Pichai, when questioned by Stanford Graduate School of Business Dean Jonathan Levin about how he maintains a culture of innovation in a company of 200,000 people amidst numerous startups attempting to disrupt Google's business, admitted that the challenge of keeping the company innovative had long kept him awake at night.

He emphasized the need for large organizations to maintain a culture of risk-taking and to develop incentives that encourage such behavior. Pichai admitted that larger companies, including Google, often become increasingly risk-averse as they grow, fearing the potential losses associated with ambitious projects.

""So you have to consciously do that. You have to push teams to do that,"" he explained, without offering specific strategies that have proven successful at Google.

One challenge Pichai mentioned is the difficulty in rewarding effort, risk-taking, and good execution without focusing solely on outcomes. ""It's easy to think you should reward outcomes. But then people start gaming it, right? People take conservative things in which you will get a good outcome,"" he noted.

Pichai also reflected on Google's past willingness to take risks, pointing to the company's ill-fated Google Glass project as an example. Though it didn't succeed, the device was one of the first to experiment with augmented reality.

""We recently said, we went back to a notion we had in early Google of Google Labs. And so we’re setting a thing up by which it’s easier to put out something without always worrying about, you know, the full brand and the weight of building a Google product,"" Pichai revealed.

Musk has denied Reuters' claim that Tesla has scrapped its plans for a more affordable EV. The Tesla CEO took to Twitter to assert that the news organization's reporting is untrue, without specifying which part of the report he was disputing. Given Musk's confirmation of the robotaxi launch, it is plausible that the CEO took issue with Reuters' assertion that the company has abandoned its low-cost EV project.

Tesla's Affordable EV Aspirations

For years, Tesla has been promising to release a more affordable EV, with prices expected to begin at $25,000. Musk himself expressed optimism in January 2023 that the model would debut in the second half of 2025. Despite these assurances, Tesla's most affordable vehicle currently is the Model 3, which starts at $39,000. The question remains as to how Tesla will price its robotaxi, and whether it will fulfill the company's long-standing promise of an affordable EV.
