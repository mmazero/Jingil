In the world of microblogging, a new player named Post News attempted to carve out a niche for itself following Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition. However, founder Noam Bardin announced last week that the platform will be closing its doors, marking a premature end to its brief existence.

Post News aimed to capitalize on Twitter's status as a hub for journalists and industry professionals, intending to create a unique space where publishers and writers could directly monetize their content. Users could purchase standalone articles from select partner outlets rather than committing to full subscriptions. While this model presented an innovative approach to digital content consumption, it ultimately failed to gain sufficient traction among users.

Bardin acknowledged the shortcomings of the platform, stating, ""Our service is not growing fast enough to become a real business or a significant platform."" Nevertheless, he believes that Post validated several key concepts related to digital content monetization, such as the potential for micropayment systems and readers' willingness to support quality journalism through tips and contributions.

The demise of Post News raises questions regarding the future of alternative monetization strategies in the rapidly evolving media landscape. With increasing numbers of independent and worker-owned publications emerging—thanks to technology platforms like Substack, Beehiiv, and Ghost—it seems plausible that these decentralized models might present viable paths forward. Yet, Post News serves as a reminder that capturing and sustaining user interest remains a formidable challenge.

It is worth noting that Post News wasn't alone in trying to seize opportunities created by Musk's Twitter acquisition. Several other Twitter alternatives launched concurrently, hoping to lure away users unhappy with his leadership choices. Unfortunately, despite hanging on for over a year since its inception, Post isn't the only new kid on the block to fold; another microblogging site, Pebble (also known as T2), closed its doors in October.

Social media, as history has shown us repeatedly, is indeed a cutthroat marketplace. Even when platforms manage to attract a sizable initial user base, maintaining long-term engagement proves elusive. As Post News discovered firsthand, success requires far more than simply filling a temporary gap left behind by larger players.

Bitcoin's latest halving occurred in May 2022, reducing miner rewards and impacting supply. Understanding this pre-programmed event helps investors anticipate potential price changes. Bitcoin's price rose significantly one year after previous halvings, but past performance does not guarantee future results.","Title: Navigating Bitcoin Halving: What It Is, Why It Matters, and Its Potential Impact

Introduction

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has undergone its latest ""halving"" event. But what does this mean for miners and the future price of bitcoin? Let's dive into the details of bitcoin halving, its impact on supply and demand, and the potential consequences for miners and investors.

Understanding Bitcoin Halving

Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, impacting the production of bitcoin. Miners use specialized computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, earning a fixed number of bitcoins as a reward. Halving reduces this fixed income by half, consequently decreasing the number of new bitcoins entering the market. With a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, the balance between supply and demand becomes crucial to bitcoin's price.

Impact on Bitcoin's Price and Supply

As halving limits the output of new bitcoins, the supply available to satisfy demand grows more slowly. If demand remains stable or increases at a faster rate than supply, bitcoin prices should rise. This principle has held true in the past, with bitcoin's price increasing significantly one year after each halving event. However, it is essential to remember that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Halving Frequency and Market Conditions

Halving occurs after the creation of every 210,000 ""blocks"" during the mining process, roughly once every four years. Following each of the three previous halvings, bitcoin's price experienced mixed results in the first few months but climbed significantly one year later. However, other bullish market conditions also influenced these returns. The recent halving in May 2022, following a year of steep increases, saw bitcoin's price at $63,907, according to CoinMarketCap.

Introduction

In the early hours of Saturday, lawmakers passed a highly debated legislation to reauthorize and expand the United States' surveillance law, dismissing objections from privacy advocates and legislators. This article delves into the details of this new bill, its implications, and the arguments surrounding it.

Understanding the Revised Surveillance Law

Known as Section 702 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the revised law empowers the government to collect communication records from technology and telephone providers concerning foreign entities. However, critics argue that the current provisions allow for the incidental collection of American citizens' private conversations during such surveillance activities.

Government agencies like the White House and intelligence leaders supported the reapproval of FISA, emphasizing its role in counteracting potential terrorism threats and cyberattacks. They further claim that much of the classified information presented in the presidential daily intelligence report stems from the Section 702 program.

Controversies Surrounding Privacy Concerns

Despite bipartisan attempts to incorporate stricter requirements for obtaining warrants before scanning the Section 702 repository for American citizen's communications, those measures did not succeed in the final vote. Opponents fear that without proper checks, both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA) might misuse their power when conducting warrantless searches involving citizens' electronic exchanges.

Politicians and civil liberties organizations opposing FISA have consistently pointed out the lack of accountability governing these search practices. With no necessity for court approval before diving into the collected metadata, concerns persist regarding possible violations of individual rights and freedoms.

Legislative History and Future Implications

Initially enacted in 1978, FISA predated the rise of the contemporary Internet. Its mass surveillance capabilities gained widespread attention following Edward Snowden's leaks in 2013, revealing extensive global monitoring operations conducted under the act—involving prominent US tech corporations and telecommunication firms indirectly.

As anticipated, the Senate approved the updated surveillance bill despite mounting criticism. Nevertheless, one notable aspect of FISA mandates the continuation of the government's programs even if there is a temporary halt in authorized powers. In essence, the statute necessitates yearly validation from the clandestine FISA Court to keep the surveillance initiatives active. Most recently, the FISA Court recertified the government's surveillance program under Section 702 in early April, enabling its ongoing utilization until at least April 2025.

With the latest extension, FISA is set to terminate at the end of 2026. As history has shown, another round of intense debate awaits policymakers as we approach the sunset period, ensuring continued vigilance around personal privacy safeguards amidst national security interests.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fisa-government-senate-reauthorization.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-20 13:00:44,"""Explore the revised US Surveillance Law: Section 702 of FISA reauthorized, raising privacy concerns.

The research team, headed by Dr. Feroz Ahmed from Bristol's School of Civil, Aerospace and Design Engineering and supervised by Professor Mahdi Azarpeyvand, employed the University National Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Facility to investigate the noise emanating from BLI ducted fans. Through extensive testing, three primary noise sources were identified: the duct, the rotating fan blades, and the air flowing over the curved airframe surface.

Thrust Level Variations and Noise Pattern Changes

As the fan's thrust level varies, so does its noise pattern. At higher thrust settings, the noise pattern mirrors that of traditional fans without ducts. Conversely, when the fan generates reduced thrust, the noise pattern transforms significantly due to increased sound emissions from the duct itself. Understanding these nuances in noise behavior will help engineers develop guidelines for creating quieter airframe-integrated propulsion systems, benefiting not only large-scale conventional aircraft but also smaller electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, referred to as eVTOL aircraft.

Addressing the Knowledge Gap

While previous studies mainly concentrated on BLI configurations without ducts, limited research has explored the acoustic implications of ducted fans ingesting air around curved airframe surfaces. Projects such as the Bell X-22A, Embraer X, Airbus E-fan, Lilium Jet, Green Jet, and Hybrid Air Vehicle exemplify cutting-edge developments incorporating these systems for next-generation aircraft. To address the existing knowledge gaps, this recent study thoroughly examines the numerous factors contributing to the noise produced by embedded ducted fans operating near curved airframe surfaces.

Experimental Setup and Data Collection

To simulate the configuration of embedded engines in aircraft concepts like the ONERA NOVA, the researchers constructed a BLI test rig equipped with an electric ducted fan adjacent to a curved wall. Various data sets, encompassing fan thrust output and noise generation metrics, were gathered during experiments involving the rig.

Unveiling the Physics Behind Noise Production

By meticulously analyzing the intricate interplay between multiple noise sources, the researchers successfully revealed the fundamental principles governing noise origination and transformation across varying thrust levels. This enhanced comprehension holds immense potential for devising strategies aimed at minimizing noise pollution in the aviation industry. Moreover, the findings may stimulate further investigations into aeroacoustic phenomena associated with ducted fans subjected to diverse inflowing turbulence conditions.

Conclusion

In summary, the University of Bristol's research marks a significant milestone in elucidating the noise generation mechanism in advanced BLI ducted fans.
