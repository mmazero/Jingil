Our team has curated two roundups for you: the 18 most interesting startups, and the staff favorites.

Truth Social: A Reality Show Like No Other

Trump's Truth Social, led by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. The company recently went public on Nasdaq as $DJT, thanks to a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). However, the financial details revealed in the filing are far from impressive. TMTG reported a $58 million loss on a meager $4 million in revenue, making it more of a ""burn cash now, and that's it"" kind of story.

Cybersecurity Darling Rubrik Files for IPO

Rubrik, a cybersecurity startup that has been raising venture capital like there's no tomorrow, has finally filed for an initial public offering (IPO). Known for its history of bleeding money, Rubrik's IPO filing shows modest revenue growth, eye-watering losses, and a pivot to subscription models.

Mahbod Moghadam, an intriguing and multifaceted figure in the startup world, has passed away at the age of 41 due to complications from a recurring brain tumor. The news was announced by his family in a post on Genius. Moghadam was a co-founder of Genius, an annotation platform, as well as Everipedia, a decentralized, blockchain-based encyclopedia. His recent endeavors focused on helping creators receive fair compensation for their work.

The tech community has been paying tribute to Moghadam in the past few days, with numerous tributes appearing on various platforms. Among the tributes, former TechCrunch writer and investor, Josh Constine, remembered Moghadam as a ""complex, edgy, and at times problematic guy, but also genuinely funny, brilliant, and always unique.""

Moghadam was living in Los Angeles, where he worked with Mucker Capital as an entrepreneur in residence and explored ways to help creators earn more directly for their contributions. His recent projects included HellaDoge, a short-lived social media platform that rewarded users with dogecoin for sharing dogecoin-related content. The platform's goal was to enable users to benefit directly from their participation, unlike traditional social media platforms that generate ad revenue.

In an interview with According 2 Hip Hop last year, Moghadam discussed his vision for a platform called Communistagram, where creators could connect their Venmo accounts and receive direct payments for their content. This idea was rooted in Moghadam's interest in fair compensation and creators' rights, which can be traced back to 2009.

After graduating from Yale and Stanford Law School, Moghadam became a lawyer just as the economy was collapsing. After being let go from his law firm, he used the severance package to co-found Rap Genius (now Genius) with two Yale friends, Ilan Zechory and Tom Lehman. Originally focused on annotating hip-hop lyrics, Rap Genius quickly gained popularity and eventually expanded its remit to include annotations for various types of content.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scalable-learningbased-framework-teleoperation-humanoid.html,A scalable reinforcement learning-based framework to facilitate the teleoperation of humanoid robots, Scalable RGB Camera-Based Framework for Humanoid Robot Teleoperation: Introducing H2O ,"Teleoperating Humanoid Robots with Precision: Introducing H2O

The prospect of operating robots from a distance, or teleoperation, opens up a world of possibilities. It could allow humans to carry out a myriad of manual tasks remotely, including intricate and hazardous procedures. Moreover, teleoperation could be employed to gather datasets of human movements, which could aid in training humanoid robots to perform new tasks.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have recently unveiled a groundbreaking method named Human2HumanOid (H2O). This approach, presented in a paper on the arXiv preprint server, promises to revolutionize the teleoperation of human-sized humanoid robots. The H2O system introduces a real-time whole-body teleoperation mechanism using merely an RGB camera, enabling a human to accurately control a humanoid in a variety of real-world tasks.

Guanya Shi, a co-author of the paper, explained to Tech Xplore, ""Many people believe that 2024 is the year of humanoid, largely because the embodiment alignment between humans and humanoids allows for a seamless integration of human cognitive skills with versatile humanoid capabilities. Yet before such an exciting integration, we need to first create an interface between human and humanoid for data collection and algorithm development. Our work H2O (Human2HumanOid) takes the first step.""

Contrasting with many other methods, H2O depends solely on an RGB camera, making it simple to scale and widely applicable. Tairan He, another co-author, elaborated, ""We believe that human teleoperation will be essential for scaling up the data flywheel for humanoid robots, and making teleoperation accessible and easy to do is our main objective. Inspired by prior works that tackled parts of this challenge, this study aims to amalgamate these components into a single framework.""

H2O offers a scalable and efficient solution, enabling researchers to collect vast datasets of human movements and apply them to humanoid robots, allowing for real-time, full-body teleoperation. Achieving real-time, whole-body teleoperation of robots is no easy feat, as the physical constraints of humanoid robots may hinder their ability to replicate human movements involving multiple limbs.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/amazon-bazaar-india-low-cost-fashion-and-lifestyle-store/,Amazon takes on India rivals with low-cost fashion store, Amazon's Bazaar Targets India's Affordable Fashion Market ,"Title: Amazon's New ""Bazaar"": A Game-Changer in India's Affordable Fashion Scene

Introduction

Amazon has recently launched a new ""special store"" in India, named Bazaar, offering a wide range of affordable and trendy fashion and lifestyle products. This move is a strategic one, as Amazon aims to strengthen its position in the Indian fast-fashion market, currently dominated by Walmart-owned Flipkart and Reliance's Ajio.

The Rise of Affordable Fast-Fashion in India

Affordable fast-fashion has been gaining popularity in India, driving purchases on various shopping apps. According to a note by brokerage firm Bernstein, the e-commerce category mix in India is changing, with the share of mobile phones and consumer electronics declining. Fashion, on the other hand, has seen the strongest growth since FY19 and currently holds the highest category share. It is essential for Amazon to have a robust offering in this category, given its traditional struggle in the Indian market.

Bazaar: Amazon's New Venture

Amazon's Bazaar offers a diverse range of products, from clothing, accessories, and jewelry to handbags, shoes, traditional and western wear, and home goods, including kitchenware, towels, bed linens, and decor items. With trendy t-shirts starting at 129 Indian rupees ($1.55) and sneakers priced under $3, Bazaar is set to attract cost-conscious customers looking for stylish options.

Competition in the Indian Fast-Fashion Market

India is a crucial overseas market for Amazon, which has invested more than $11 billion in the country to date. Despite Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintaining its market-leading position in India, the e-commerce arm lags behind Flipkart. Fast-fashion e-commerce has gained significant traction in India, with local startups drawing inspiration from global pioneers like Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo.

Flipkart, which owns the fashion e-commerce platform Myntra, currently leads the category. However, it faces increasing competition from Reliance's Ajio, which has captured approximately 30% market share in about a year, according to Bernstein.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1169388446.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 18:49:01,"Discover Amazon's Bazaar: Affordable Fashion for Style-conscious Indians!

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/meta-deepfake-labels/,"Meta's new AI deepfake playbook: More labels, fewer takedowns"," Meta's New AI Deepfake Policy: More Labels, Less Takedowns ","Meta to Implement Changes in AI-Generated Content and Manipulated Media

Meta, the social networking giant, has announced updates to its policies regarding AI-generated content and manipulated media. The changes come after criticism from Meta's Oversight Board, which called the company's existing approach to AI-generated content ""incoherent.""

New Labeling Policy

Starting next month, Meta will apply a ""Made with AI"" badge to deepfakes and provide contextual information when content has been manipulated in a way that could potentially deceive the public on critical issues. The new labels will be used for a wider range of AI-generated content, with Meta focusing on providing transparency and additional context as a better way to address manipulated media.

Addressing Free Speech Concerns

Meta emphasized that the policy change is not intended to remove manipulated media entirely, citing associated risks to free speech. Instead, the company aims to implement more labels and fewer takedowns for AI-generated or otherwise manipulated media on its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.

Policy Changes in Response to Legal Demands

Meta's decision to amend its policies may be in response to legal demands around content moderation and systemic risk, such as the European Union's Digital Services Act. The EU law, implemented last August, requires Meta to balance purging illegal content, mitigating systemic risks, and protecting free speech.

The upcoming US presidential election in November may also be a factor in Meta's decision to update its policies.

Oversight Board's Recommendations

Meta's Oversight Board, which the tech giant funds but permits to operate independently, made policy recommendations that influenced the company's decision to amend its approach to AI-generated content. Meta is not obligated to accept the Board's suggestions but has agreed to modify its policies based on the Board's feedback.

Expanding Labeling of Synthetic Media

Earlier this year, Meta announced it was working with other industry leaders to develop common technical standards for identifying AI content, including video and audio. The company will now expand the use of 'Made with AI' labels for AI-generated video, audio, and images based on its detection of industry-shared signals of AI images or people self-disclosing that they are uploading AI-generated","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-944719854.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 17:29:58," Meta Description:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/x-makes-grok-chatbot-available-to-premium-subscribers/,X makes Grok chatbot available to premium subscribers, xAI's Grok Chatbot Now Accessible to Social Network X's Premium Users ,"Title: Exclusive Access to xAI's Grok Chatbot: A Game-Changer for Social Network X's Premium Users

Social network X has recently announced that it will be granting access to xAI's Grok chatbot to its Premium tier subscribers. This expansion follows Elon Musk's announcement last month, indicating that more paid users will soon be able to interact with the chatbot. As of now, only Premium and Premium+ users in select regions can enjoy this new feature.

Previously, Grok was exclusively available to Premium+ users, who pay a $16 per month or $168 per year subscription fee. However, with the latest update, Social network X has extended access to users who pay $8 per month, making the chatbot more accessible to a broader audience.

Grok offers users two modes for interaction: Regular mode and Fun mode. As with other Large Language Model (LLM) products, Grok includes labels that alert users about potential inaccuracies in the chatbot's responses. There have been instances where Grok generated headlines that were far from the truth. For instance, the chatbot recently wrote a fake headline stating, ""Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles.""

Elon Musk's decision to make Grok more accessible to Social network X users may be a strategic move to compete with other AI-powered chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude. Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations in recent months, even going so far as to sue the company in March over what he perceives as a betrayal of its non-profit goal. OpenAI has since filed papers seeking the dismissal of all of Musk's claims and released email exchanges between the Tesla CEO and the company.

In addition to making Grok more accessible, xAI has also open-sourced the chatbot, although without providing any training data details. While this move raises questions about the latest version of the model and the company's transparency regarding its development and training data, it is undoubtedly an exciting time for Social network X's Premium users, who can now enjoy a more engaging and interactive experience.

In a recent turn of events, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has announced the reveal of a robotaxi on August 8, following claims that Reuters was ""lying"" about Tesla's plans to abandon its low-cost EV project. According to sources from Reuters, Tesla is shifting its focus towards building a robotaxi, which will be based on the same platform initially intended for the affordable electric vehicle.

In the past, Tesla has been known to work on two distinct vehicles, one with a steering wheel and pedals, and another with no such components. Despite the lack of a fully autonomous vehicle, Musk has consistently pushed for the latter. Nevertheless, key engineers within Tesla, including Franz von Holzhausen and Lars Moravy, maintained a more traditional car version as an ongoing ""shadow project.""

Throughout the years, Musk has made numerous promises regarding the autonomous capabilities of Tesla vehicles. As early as 2016, he predicted that Tesla cars would drive cross-country without human intervention by the end of 2017. In 2019, he announced plans to introduce the company's first robotaxis as part of a grand vision for an autonomous ride-sharing network in 2020. However, these ambitious goals remain unfulfilled.

Presently, Tesla vehicles are equipped with a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, with an additional ""full self-driving"" (FSD) feature available for $12,000. This upgrade promises future autonomous driving capabilities. Nevertheless, Tesla vehicles are not yet self-driving, and the FSD still requires a driver's constant supervision.

The upcoming unveiling of the Tesla robotaxi on August 8 is expected to reveal a vehicle that aligns with Musk's vision for self-driving transportation. This new development may provide a much-needed boost for Tesla's sales and stock price, as the company's EV sales and profits have been experiencing a decline.

The robotaxi's launch might represent a significant shift in the automotive industry, marking a new era of transportation characterized by autonomous vehicles and sustainable energy.

Boston has become a thriving hub for startups, with success breeding success. From Hubspot's initial public offering (IPO) to Klaviyo's recent public debut, the city has seen its share of successful exits. This article explores the unique qualities of the Boston startup ecosystem that contribute to its success, focusing on the role of universities, talent, and access to capital.

The Boston Advantage: A Rich University Network

A significant factor contributing to Boston's success as a startup hub is its rich network of universities. The city is home to 35 colleges and universities, while the broader metropolitan area includes 44 institutions, such as Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. These institutions serve as breeding grounds for new ideas, fostering innovation and research that can be translated into startups.

Emily Knight, President at The Engine Accelerator, highlights the importance of universities in generating new ideas, stating, ""There is a lot of research and a lot of infant innovation being translated into companies coming out of these universities."" This robust university ecosystem has played a crucial role in attracting investment firms like Underscore VC, which has built a portfolio emphasizing startups from Harvard, MIT, and Northeastern.

Talent Pool and Industry Specialization

Boston's universities also contribute to a deep pool of talent, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Rudina Seseri, Managing Director at Glasswing Ventures, points out that AI and machine learning (ML) talent is abundant in the region, aligning well with her firm's investments in enterprise and cybersecurity.

Lily Lyman, a partner at Underscore VC, affirms that the combination of tech, R&D, and talent in Boston is unparalleled. This unique blend of resources creates a strong foundation for a successful startup ecosystem.

Access to Capital and Supporting the Next Generation

Boston ranks fourth nationally in Q4 2023 for venture investment dollars, according to PitchBook, with $3.5 billion invested in the region.

In response to recent concerns about the impact of Snapchat's ""Solar System"" feature on teenagers' anxiety levels, the company has decided to make some adjustments. This feature, which ranks paid subscribers based on their communication frequency with friends, has been criticized for negatively affecting users' feelings and perceptions of their relationships.

The ""Solar System"" feature initially displays your position in a friend's social circle, with positions such as ""Mercury"" for close friends and ""Uranus"" for less frequent contacts. While it can be comforting to see that you are close to someone, it can also be disheartening to realize that you aren't as close as you'd like to be. Acknowledging this feedback, Snapchat announced that it would turn the feature off by default for Snapchat+ subscribers, who can still enable it if they wish.

Snapchat believes that this change will provide a balance between offering a desired feature and preventing unwanted feelings of exclusion or disappointment. However, it is uncertain whether this adjustment will significantly reduce the potential for hurt feelings, as curious teens might still seek out and enable the feature.

While Snapchat insists that the ""Solar System"" feature is not widely popular, with less than 0.25% of the community using it, this percentage may not accurately represent its usage among Snapchat+ subscribers. In light of these concerns, the company should consider providing more relevant statistics to give a clearer picture of the feature's popularity within the Snapchat+ user base.

Previously, Snapchat has faced controversy over features like the dangerous speed filter, which led to a negligent design lawsuit. However, the ""Solar System"" feature differs in that it is not directly linked to harmful behavior but rather affects users' emotional well-being.

Snapchat has also implemented other friend ranking systems, such as the private ""Best Friends"" feature, which highlights the most frequently contacted individuals with special emojis. Another feature, ""Streaks,"" encourages repeated app usage by displaying the number of consecutive days users have been in touch.

The soaring value of zero-day exploits, or ""dangerous flaws,"" highlights the growing challenge faced by cybersecurity teams worldwide. As companies bolster their defenses, hackers are forced to invest more resources into discovering and exploiting these vulnerabilities, leading to an increase in their black-market price.

The growing difficulty in hacking devices and apps protected by companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft has led to a surge in the prices offered for zero-day exploits. Crowdfense is now offering between $5 and $7 million for zero-days to break into iPhones, up to $5 million for zero-days to break into Android phones, and up to $3.5 million for Chrome and Safari zero-days.

These prices represent a significant increase from the previous price list published in 2019. Dustin Childs, the head of threat awareness at Trend Micro ZDI, explains that it should be harder year over year to exploit whatever software and devices we're using. Google's Threat Analysis Group concurs, stating that as more zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and platform protections improve, the time and effort required from attackers increase, resulting in higher costs for their findings.

In 2023, Google reported that hackers used 97 zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild last year, with spyware vendors being responsible for 75% of zero-days targeting Google products and Android. The zero-day market is becoming increasingly challenging, as vendors implement stronger mitigations, making it more complicated, time-consuming, and expensive to exploit vulnerabilities.

The Evolution of the Zero-Day Market

The evolution of the zero-day market has led to a growing number of researchers and hackers specializing in finding and exploiting these vulnerabilities. In 2015 or 2016, a single researcher could potentially discover and develop one or more zero-days into full-fledged exploits targeting iPhones or Androids.

However, the market has become more competitive and sophisticated, with specialized teams and companies now dominating the scene. Paolo Stagno, the director of research at Crowdfense, explains that the market has changed, and now there are more players, more vendors, and more researchers.

Introduction:

Alphabet CEO, Sundar Pichai, made a recent appearance at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he discussed the challenges and opportunities of leading a major tech company in the era of AI. Despite facing criticism for Google's late entry into generative AI and issues with its Gemini LLM, Pichai addressed the importance of fostering innovation, taking risks, and adopting AI in large organizations.

Fostering Innovation and Taking Risks:

Pichai expressed his concerns about keeping a large organization like Google innovative amidst the ever-growing number of startups trying to disrupt the business. He acknowledged that large organizations, including tech giants and universities, often become risk-averse due to their size and perceived vulnerabilities.

As a solution, Pichai emphasized the need to create a culture that supports risk-taking and rewards effort and good execution rather than just focusing on outcomes. He referred to Google's early days, when the company was more willing to take on ambitious projects like Google Glass, which didn't succeed but paved the way for augmented reality devices.

To further encourage innovation, Google has recently revived the concept of Google Labs, allowing for easier prototyping and experimentation without the full pressure of building a final product. Pichai encouraged teams to push boundaries and not be afraid of taking calculated risks.

Embracing AI and Multimodality:

Pichai also shared his excitement about AI advancements, particularly focusing on Google's latest LLM, which can process different kinds of inputs, such as video and text, simultaneously. This capability, known as multimodality, allows for processing vast amounts of information in various formats and delivering outputs that can handle complex workflows.

The potential applications of these advancements are numerous, from improving university billing systems to streamlining various business operations. By connecting discrete answers together, AI can provide smarter and more efficient workflows, making processes more manageable and user-friendly.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/us-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/,New U.S. ‘green bank’ aims to steer over $160B in capital into climate tech," ""US Green Bank's $160B Plan for Climate Tech & Underserved Communities"" ","Title: The New US 'Green Bank': A Game-Changer for Climate Tech

A significant development in the realm of climate technology financing has taken place, with the potential to steer over $160 billion in capital into this critical sector. This change is marked by the establishment of a 'green bank' in the United States, aimed at supporting smaller-scale climate projects that have often been overlooked by traditional financial institutions.

Historically, banks have favored large-scale renewable energy projects, such as expansive wind farms and utility-scale solar projects. Smaller ventures, like residential heat pump installations and affordable housing retrofits, have not been as attractive due to their lower profitability. However, the demand for such projects is undeniable, leading advocates to push for federal government support of a green bank to underwrite these initiatives.

The wait is now over, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it had awarded $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations. These groups will utilize the funds to provide loans for climate-focused projects, with a particular emphasis on tribal, rural, low-income, and disadvantaged communities. Over $14 billion will be directed towards these specific communities, ensuring that the benefits are equitably distributed.

Green bank loans have a strong track record, as demonstrated by the Connecticut Green Bank's delinquency rate, which mirrors that of other commercial lenders across both residential and commercial portfolios. Furthermore, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the official name of the new green bank, seeks to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar disbursed. This could potentially lead to more than $12 in private investment per dollar on its balance sheet, according to a McKinsey estimate.

The US is projected to require $27 trillion by 2050 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, making the green bank's $20 billion allocation seem modest. However, its potential to stimulate private investment and serve as more than a one-time grant will enable it to have a lasting impact beyond its initial financial contribution.

Entrepreneurs and investors stand to gain from this development as well. While the funding primarily targets consumers and small businesses, equity investments are a possibility. The influx of funding should also boost demand for commercially deployable climate technologies.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1163558463.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 20:17:07,"""Unleashing Climate Investments: Discover the US 'Green Bank,' mobilizing $160B+ for small-scale projects.
