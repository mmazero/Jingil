https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-ditches-microsoft-for-linux-and-libreoffice/,German state ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice, Schleswig-Holstein Ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice to Boost Security and Save Money ,"The German State of Schleswig-Holstein has recently made a bold move by deciding to switch from proprietary software to open-source systems and digitally sovereign IT workplaces for its 30,000 employees. The state cabinet announced that it would be replacing Windows and Office with Linux and LibreOffice, the popular open-source office suite. This decision was not made due to the technical superiority of Linux and LibreOffice but because of the values of digital sovereignty.

The EU's concept of digital sovereignty is all about protecting citizens' data from being vacuumed up by foreign companies and enabling European tech companies to compete with their American and Chinese rivals. The term digital sovereignty is crucial here, as it enables the public administration to have control over the IT solutions they use and ensure that they can act independently as a state.

One of the primary reasons for the state's switch to open-source software is to increase security and save money. The use of open-source software also enables improved IT security, cost-effectiveness, data protection, and seamless collaboration between different systems. The plan is to replace Microsoft Office with LibreOffice, Windows with a yet-to-be-determined Linux desktop distro, and other Microsoft-specific programs with open-source equivalents.

This move by Schleswig-Holstein follows a pattern set by other countries that have made the switch from Windows to Linux. Munich, the capital of Bavaria, Germany, made the switch in 2004, and the move lasted for a decade before Munich returned to Windows. The move was driven by the desire to have Microsoft move its headquarters to Munich, as the mayor wanted. In China, the government has replaced the last few Chinese government PCs running Windows with systems mostly using Kylin Linux, as they wanted to control their desktop and ensure that their data was kept safe.

The decision by Schleswig-Holstein to switch from proprietary software to open-source systems and digitally sovereign IT workplaces has important implications for the future of technology and data privacy. As more governments and organizations make the switch to open-source software, it becomes increasingly difficult for companies like Microsoft to maintain their dominance in the market. It also paves the way for greater transparency and control over the data being collected and stored by governments and organizations.

In conclusion, the decision by Schleswig-Holstein to switch from proprietary software to open-source systems and digitally sovereign IT workplaces is an important step towards greater transparency, control, and security in the digital age. As more governments and organizations make the switch, it becomes increasingly clear that open-source software is the way forward for the future of technology.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b085644004b92494364cdaa5d4c958b378d5580a/2024/04/04/6eca21f6-18f8-40f8-bf2a-44528758a5c6/2pneguinsgettyimages-534970880.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-04 00:00:00,"The German state of Schleswig-Holstein is making strides towards digital sovereignty by switching to open-source systems and Linux for its employees.

We'll discuss the benefits of using autonomous AI coding and how it can help software developers, managers, and employees. However, we'll also examine the limitations of AI software engineers and how they may not be suitable for all industries or use cases.

In this post, we'll cover the topic of AI software engineers and how they can assist in the security workforce. We'll discuss the benefits of using AI for software development and how it can help businesses save time and resources. We'll also explore the limitations of AI and how it may not be suitable for all industries or use cases.

In the world of software development, AI is becoming an increasingly popular tool for streamlining processes and improving productivity. One of the most well-known AI software engineers is Devin, an AI ""software engineer"" from startup Cognition that can autonomously write code, even full applications, given natural language instructions from a user.

Devin has already been used by leading AI influencers, such as University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick, to code entire websites for them. However, for enterprises looking to maintain existing codebases and apps, and push updates to their software for employees or customers in high-security, highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, law, government, and telecommunications, the idea of turning loose an AI software engineer all on its own to do these tasks may be slightly less appealing.

This is where Codium AI comes in. The company has developed a new tool called Codiumate, a semi-autonomous AI agent that works alongside a human software developer or team. Codiumate takes any existing code snippets a human developer highlights in their environment and automatically drafts step-by-step development plans based on it, writes code according to the plan, identifies duplicate code, drafts documentation for the code so that developers can reference it going forward, and suggests tests to ensure the code works properly before it is deployed for real in a live, production environment.

Codiumate was developed to address the fact that writing code is only ""20 to 30 percent of what developers do."" All the rest is meant to define what we do with our code, what we want to do with it, and check that it actually happened. That's what Codium AI is focused on.

Codiumate is designed to aid developers in their workflow, speeding up all the manual typing they would otherwise have to do, doing the ""heavy lifting"" and mechanical coding work, while enabling the developer to act more as a hands-on product manager overseeing the process and course correcting it as necessary, almost as though it is a junior developer or new hire to the team.

Codiumate is powered by ""best of breed"" OpenAI models, and the company is also experimenting with Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini. It also offers its own large language model (LLM) designed with its AlphaCodium process that increases the performance of other LLMs in code completion tasks.

As technology continues to advance, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become more widespread. However, the energy consumption associated with its development and use has become a major concern. In fact, a single ChatGPT prompt is estimated to consume as much energy as forty mobile phone charges. This has led researchers at the University of Copenhagen to explore the possibility of developing AI models that are energy efficient and environmentally friendly.

The study conducted by Raghavendra Selvan and Pedram Bakhtiarifard demonstrates that it is possible to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of AI models without compromising their accuracy. This is achieved by keeping climate costs in mind from the design and training phases of AI models. The researchers calculated the energy consumption of more than 400,000 convolutional neural network type AI models and found that by opting for other types of models or adjusting models, 70-80% energy savings can be achieved during the training and deployment phase, with only a 1% or less decrease in performance.

The researchers also emphasize that energy efficiency should be a fixed criterion when AI models are developed for different tasks, just as it is standard in many other industries. While model precision is critical in certain fields like self-driving cars or medicine, it should not be a deterrence to striving for high energy efficiency in other domains.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-game-theory-ai-evolve-selfish.html,Game theory research shows AI can evolve into more selfish or cooperative personalities,AI Personality Evolution: Selfish and Cooperative Behaviors,"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology, and this includes the way we communicate with each other. Large-scale language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to evolve various types of personalities in social interactions, mimicking human behavior. In a study published in Scientific Reports, researchers from Nagoya University's Graduate School of Informatics developed a framework for evolving AI agents that switch between selfish and cooperative actions, adapting their strategies through evolutionary processes.

The study used the prisoner's dilemma from game theory as a basis for the experiments. The AI agents were evolved to obtain virtual earnings by playing the game, where each player chooses whether to cooperate with or defect from their partner. The dilemma consists of each player choosing whether to cooperate with or defect from their partner. If both AI systems cooperate, they each receive four virtual dollars. However, if one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets five dollars, while the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, they receive one dollar each.

In this study, the researchers aimed to investigate how AI agents endowed with diverse personality traits interact and evolve. By utilizing the remarkable capabilities of LLMs, they developed a framework where AI agents evolve based on natural language descriptions of personality traits encoded in their genes. The framework allowed for the observation of various types of personality traits, with AI agents capable of switching between selfish and cooperative behaviors.

The researchers used an evolutionary framework, in which AI agents' abilities were shaped by natural selection and mutation over generations. This caused a wide range of personality traits to appear, with some agents displaying selfish characteristics, while others demonstrated advanced strategies that revolved around seeking personal gain while still considering mutual and collective benefit.

The study provides fascinating insights into the evolutionary dynamics of personality traits in AI agents. The researchers observed the emergence of both cooperative and selfish personality traits within AI populations, reminiscent of human societal dynamics. However, they also uncovered the instability inherent in AI societies, with excessively cooperative groups being replaced by more 'egocentric' agents.

The achievement underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in AI research, showing that the evolution of personality traits based on subtle linguistic expressions can be represented by a computational model using LLMs. The findings provide insights into the characteristics that AI agents should possess to contribute to human society, as well as design guidelines for AI societies and societies with mixed AI and human populations, which are expected to arrive in the not-too-distant future.

In conclusion, the study highlights the potential of AI to evolve and adapt based on natural language descriptions of personality traits. The development of a framework for evolving AI agents that switch between selfish and cooperative actions, adapting their strategies through evolutionary processes, provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics of personality traits in AI agents. The findings have the potential to transform the development of AI agents and the ways in which they interact with humans in the future.

Amorphous Flexible Mini-Inductor: A Game-Changer in Flexible Electronics

Mini-inductors are essential components in power conversion and signal processing, and their design can have a significant impact on device performance, energy consumption, and miniaturization. The use of soft magnetic amorphous alloys as coil materials offers excellent properties for the development of flexible mini-inductors.

A research team at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has successfully developed a novel flexible mini-inductor using amorphous soft magnetic alloys. The study, published in Advanced Functional Materials, demonstrates the superior flexibility and high inductance of this new technology.

One of the main advantages of this amorphous flexible mini-inductor is its ability to achieve high energy density while minimizing magnetic leakage. This is a major challenge in traditional inductors, which are often made of non-magnetic materials that cause magnetic leakage, reducing the inductance density and making them unsuitable for low-frequency applications.

To achieve this, the NIMTE team used high-precision femtosecond laser ablation technology to precisely craft amorphous alloy ribbons, which were used to fabricate the flexible mini-inductor. The laser ablation process ensures that the amorphous alloys are not crystallized, while maintaining their excellent mechanical properties.

Compared to conventional inductors based on non-magnetic materials like copper, the developed mini-inductor significantly reduces magnetic leakage to less than 10-4 T, greatly minimizing interference between electronic components. The high permeability of the amorphous alloys also increases the inductance density of the device by about 280–390 nH/mm2, which is about 10 times higher than that of conventional planar inductors.

Moreover, the amorphous structure of the mini-inductor gives it excellent mechanical flexibility. It can be stretched by up to 300% of its original size, and after 2,500 bending cycles with a 16-mm bending radius, the device retains its performance with only a slight decay in inductance value and quality factor.

This amorphous flexible mini-inductor is highly adaptable to various bending and folding application environments, making it an ideal choice for miniaturized electronic products. It also offers a new application scenario for amorphous soft magnetic alloys, shedding light on the material selection and device design of flexible electronics technology.

In conclusion, the development of this amorphous flexible mini-inductor marks a significant advancement in the field of flexible electronics. Its superior properties make it a game-changer in the design of high-performance, miniaturized electronic devices.

In our increasingly connected world, smart devices such as robotic vacuum cleaners, smart fridges, and delivery drones have become commonplace in homes and workplaces. These devices utilize vision to understand their surroundings, capturing images and videos in the process. However, a team of researchers from the University of Sydney and Queensland University of Technology is working to ensure that these devices don't compromise our privacy.

The researchers have developed a novel approach to designing cameras that process and scramble visual information before digitization, rendering it unrecognizable and protecting user privacy. This privacy-preserving camera is an essential innovation as smart devices continue to proliferate and become more integrated into our lives.

Traditional smart devices, classified as 'sighted systems,' are part of the internet-of-things and can be vulnerable to hacking or loss, putting images and videos at risk of being stolen. The researchers' solution involves segmenting the processing that normally occurs within a computer, moving it to the optics and analog electronics of the camera, which are inaccessible to potential attackers.

This new approach differs from previous methods that obfuscated images within the camera's computer, as the researchers have taken protection a step further by targeting the electronics themselves. The team attempted to hack their method but was unsuccessful, showcasing the robustness of the privacy-preserving camera.

The distorted images can still be used by robots to complete tasks as they contain necessary visual information, but the images do not provide a comprehensive visual representation that could compromise privacy. Dr. Don Dansereau, the supervisor of the research, explains, ""If these images were to be accessed by a third party, they would not be able to make much of them, and privacy would be preserved.""

Privacy concerns will only grow as more devices come equipped with built-in cameras and new technologies emerge. The privacy-preserving camera can help mitigate these concerns, ensuring that user data remains secure.

In the quest for sustainable energy sources, scientists are constantly seeking ways to improve processes related to fuel production. A significant area of focus is electrocatalysis, a critical component in devices like fuel cells and electrolyzers that convert chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Electrocatalysis relies on catalysts to speed up electrochemical reactions without being consumed, making it a fundamental process in green-energy technologies.

Traditional electrocatalysis methods, however, often face efficiency challenges. The transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface is a crucial step in energy conversion, and limitations in this area can lower reaction efficiency and hinder progress towards clean energy solutions. Recognizing this challenge, a team of researchers led by Magalí Lingenfelder at EPFL has devised an innovative approach to enhance the efficiency of clean fuel production.

By surrounding catalysts with magnetic fields, the researchers created Lorentz forces, which induce whirling motions that improve the movement of reactants and products at the catalyst surface. This enhanced movement leads to a more consistent and rapid reaction and overcomes the limitations posed by reactant scarcity, a common issue in reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is critical for fuel cells.

To observe the movement of ions in real-time under a magnetic field, the researchers used an advanced magneto-electrochemical setup. By applying magnetic fields to non-magnetic electrodes and monitoring reactions, they were able to decouple different effects and observe how magnetic forces stir and enhance the movement of reactants around the catalyst. This process, akin to creating miniature whirlpools, significantly improves the efficiency of reactions crucial for green hydrogen production, offering a promising avenue for advancing sustainable energy technologies.

The study demonstrated a more than 50% boost in activity for the oxygen reduction reaction induced by magnetic fields on non-magnetic interfaces. This substantial increase in efficiency also allowed the team to resolve many fundamental controversies in the field by demonstrating the mechanisms and conditions needed for magnetic fields to enhance different electrocatalytic reactions involving gas products or reactants like hydrogen and oxygen.

This new method holds great promise for practical applications.

In the ever-evolving world of data storage, researchers are constantly seeking innovative solutions to meet the increasing demands of data centers. A groundbreaking study by teams from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University has made significant strides in this area. The researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective data storage in the future.

At present, hard disk drives (HDDs) utilize perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) to store information at densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/in2. However, to transition to higher densities, a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium consisting of FePt grains combined with heat-assisted laser writing is required. This method, known as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), can sustain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/in2. Moreover, densities greater than 10 Tbit/in2 are possible based on a new principle that involves storing multiple recording levels of 3 or 4, as opposed to the binary level used in conventional HDD technology.

In this groundbreaking study, published in Acta Materialia, the team successfully arranged the FePt recording layers in a three-dimensional lattice-matched FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer film, with Ru as a spacer layer. Measurements of the magnetization revealed that the two FePt layers have different Curie temperatures, enabling three-dimensional recording by adjusting the laser power during the writing process.

The researchers also showcased the principle of 3D recording through recording simulations. They utilized a media model that mimics the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media. The three-dimensional magnetic recording method can increase recording capacity by stacking recording layers in three dimensions, allowing for the storage of more digital information with fewer HDDs, ultimately leading to energy savings for data centers.

The potential of this technology is immense. By reducing the size of FePt grains, improving orientation and magnetic anisotropy, and stacking more FePt layers, the researchers aim to develop a media structure suitable for practical use in high-density HDDs.

Introduction:
Emilia Gómez is a principal investigator at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and scientific coordinator of AI Watch, an EC initiative to monitor the advancements, uptake, and impact of AI in Europe. Her work in the computational music field has contributed significantly to the understanding of how humans describe music and the methods used to model it digitally. In this interview, we explore Gómez’s journey in the world of AI, her proudest achievements, and her current work at the Joint Research Centre.

Body:

What attracted you to the field of AI?

Emilia Gómez: I started my research in AI, particularly in machine learning, as a developer of algorithms for the automatic description of music audio signals in terms of melody, tonality, similarity, style, or emotion. What I liked at the time was the shift from knowledge-driven to data-driven algorithm design. Instead of designing descriptors based on our knowledge of acoustics and music, we were now using our know-how to design data sets, architectures, and training and evaluation procedures. This approach allowed us to model complex phenomena like music in a more accurate and efficient way.

What work are you most proud of (in the AI field)?

Emilia Gómez: On the academic and technical side, I’m proud of my contributions to music-specific machine learning architectures at the Music Technology Group in Barcelona, which have advanced the state of the art in the field. For instance, during my PhD, I proposed a data-driven algorithm to extract tonality from audio signals, which has become a key reference in the field. Later, I co-designed machine learning methods for the automatic description of music signals in terms of melody, tempo, or for modeling emotions in music. These algorithms are currently integrated into Essentia, an open-source library for audio and music analysis, description, and synthesis, and have been exploited in many recommender systems.

I’m particularly proud of Banda Sonora Vital (LifeSoundTrack), a project awarded by the Red Cross Award for Humanitarian Technologies. We developed a personalized music recommender adapted to senior Alzheimer patients. The project aimed to help improve their quality of life by providing them with music that stimulated their emotions and memories.

I also coordinated a large European Union (EU)-funded project called PHENICX, which focused on the use of music and AI to create enriched symphonic music experiences. The project aimed to develop innovative technologies that could enhance the emotional impact of music and help people connect with it on a deeper level.

I love the music computing community, and I was honored to become the first female president of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval. It was an incredible experience to lead such a distinguished organization and contribute to increasing diversity in the field.

Currently, in my role at the Commission, I provide scientific and technical support to AI policies developed in the EU, particularly the AI Act.

Are We Witnessing Another Google Acquisition?

Google's parent company, Alphabet, is reportedly considering a potential acquisition of Boston-based HubSpot, a CRM and marketing automation company with a market capitalization of over $33 billion. If such a deal were to happen, it would likely be a significant premium over the current value, as it would motivate the company to sell and become part of the search giant.

It's worth noting that the two companies have a partnership to use Google ads to drive sales in HubSpot, which can sometimes be the start of an acquisition discussion like this. However, Google has a history of being extremely acquisitive, with its largest deal to date being the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2011. This deal was later sold to Lenovo for just $2.91 billion, which could make the company gun shy on a much larger price tag.

Recently, the largest deal involved spending $5.4 billion for security intelligence platform Mandiant in 2022. Google usually stays under $3 billion, so a deal of this scope would be very much out of character for the company. The current climate of austerity among most tech companies, coupled with Google CEO Sundar Pichai's warning in January that more job cuts were coming, makes it unlikely that such a deal would be successful, especially if the optics of the deal were unfavorable to employees.

However, with a cash horde of $110 billion on hand as of the end of last year, Google certainly has the cash to make the move if it wants to. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny of large deals has been on the rise in the U.S., the U.K., and the EU, which could pose a challenge for Alphabet. While deals like Adobe's failed attempt to buy Figma for $20 billion due to competitive concerns, a CRM tool may not face the same scrutiny.

The question is whether such a deal is likely to happen and what benefits would both companies gain from the acquisition that they cannot obtain from their current partnership. While it may not feel likely, the possibility of Google acquiring HubSpot is not entirely impossible. The fate of this potential deal remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - Google has the cash to make it happen if it wants to.

A groundbreaking development in memory technology has been achieved by a team of Korean researchers, led by Professor Shinhyun Choi from the KAIST School of Electrical Engineering. This team has created a next-generation phase change memory (PCRAM) device that consumes significantly less power compared to conventional PCRAM devices, offering a promising solution for future artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and memory replacement applications. The research has been published in the prestigious journal Nature.

Traditional phase change memory combines the advantages of both DRAM and NAND flash memory, providing high speed and non-volatile characteristics. However, it faces a significant challenge in requiring substantial power for operation, making it difficult to develop large-capacity memory products or realize a neuromorphic computing system.

Previously, researchers attempted to reduce power consumption by shrinking the physical size of the device through advanced lithography technologies. However, these efforts resulted in increased fabrication costs and complexity without offering significant improvements in power consumption.

Professor Choi's team has successfully addressed the power consumption problem by developing a method to electrically form phase change materials in an extremely small area. This innovative approach resulted in an ultra-low power PCRAM device that consumes 15 times less power than a conventional PCRAM device fabricated with expensive lithography tools.

The new PCRAM device features a nanofilament phase change memory (NFPCM), which, when set, forms a highly confined BEC (bipolar electronic conduction) within the a-Si (amorphous silicon) layer. The diameter of the Te-injected filament, responsible for the set state, is approximately 5.5 nm. High-resolution TEM images and electron diffraction patterns reveal the distinct structures of the filament and the non-filamentary a-Si layer.

This new memory technology offers significant advantages, including:

1. Ultra-low power consumption: The NFPCM consumes 15 times less power than conventional PCRAM devices, making it an ideal candidate for large-capacity memory products and neuromorphic computing systems.
2. Highly scalable fabrication: The NFPCM eliminates the need for expensive fabrication processes, reducing processing costs and increasing scalability.

In recent years, the Chinese-owned short-form video app TikTok has become a popular platform for Gen Z and younger audiences to showcase their creativity and connect with like-minded individuals. However, the app has faced scrutiny from US lawmakers, who argue that it poses a national security risk due to its ties to the Chinese government. As a result, TikTok has been banned in the US, and its parent company, ByteDance, has faced significant financial losses.

To stall the ban, TikTok released an economic impact report on Thursday, highlighting the significant economic benefits that the app provides to small- to mid-size businesses (SMBs) in the US. The report found that TikTok generated $14.7 billion for SMBs in 2020, and a further $24.2 billion in total economic activity. The study, conducted by the economics forecasting group, Oxford Economics, measured SMB activity on TikTok, along with ad spend and ROI, and leveraged census data and other measurements to come to its conclusions.

The report also found that over 7 million US businesses rely on TikTok, and that 224,000 jobs were supported by small business activity on the platform in 2023. Of those, 98,000 jobs were supported directly within SMBs on TikTok. The states with the largest impacts included California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois.

The economic impact report is a solid argument against a TikTok ban, highlighting the significant economic benefits that the app provides to businesses and individuals in the US. The report also addresses the concerns of those who argue that a TikTok ban could harm US businesses, particularly those in the creative industries.

In addition to the economic impact report, TikTok has also been urging users to call Congress to protest the ban. While the bill still faces a difficult path to pass in the Senate, particularly with the recent reversal of the Republican party’s leader’s position on the ban, TikTok’s economic impact report provides a powerful argument against a ban.

The Economic Impact of TikTok on US Small Businesses

TikTok has become an essential platform for small- to mid-size businesses (SMBs) in the US, providing a unique platform for businesses to connect with their target audience and showcase their products and services. The app has become particularly popular among Gen Z and younger audiences, who are more likely to engage with short-form video content.

TikTok has been criticized for its ties to the Chinese government, with some arguing that the app poses a national security risk due to its data collection practices and its parent company’s ties to the Chinese government. However, TikTok has argued that it is a separate entity from ByteDance and that it operates independently in the US.

In recent years, AI has transformed the way we search online. With the integration of AI technology into search engines, businesses have expressed concerns about the potential loss of web traffic due to SEO efforts. However, a new study of Perplexity, an AI-first search engine, suggests that these fears may be overblown.

According to Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, a company that has spent time analyzing Perplexity's search results, the referral traffic from Perplexity's search engine to brand websites has grown 40% month-over-month since January. Furthermore, 60% of Perplexity's citations match the top 10 organic Google results, meaning that users of Perplexity are shown similar and relevant answers to queries.

Yu emphasizes that companies still need to invest in SEO, but in an AI era, credibility will be key. Instead of focusing on optimizing individual pages, companies should sharpen their focus on the topics they have the right to win in. This will require a shift in strategy and a much larger investment in SEO efforts.

Google has remained the undisputed search leader for decades, but AI, particularly generative AI, is threatening its market dominance. Perplexity's referral traffic growth is evidence of this. While Google is still far from hobbled, there is momentum in the market.

To understand Perplexity's impact on search, Yu studied nine industries: healthcare, education, B2B tech, restaurants, travel, entertainment, insurance, finance, and retail e-commerce. The team uncovered domain differences between Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Perplexity, highlighting which content sources are received the most by which search engine.

Reddit is a top domain across seven of the top nine industries, except for Healthcare and Finance. For Finance, Perplexity prefers Yahoo, MarketWatch, and CNN. The Mayo Clinic, Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Coursera are deemed to have high authority for healthcare, restaurants, travel, and education, respectively. E-commerce is an area where Perplexity and Google don't exactly see eye-to-eye. Both use Wikipedia and Amazon, but regarding third-party product reviews, Google uses Quora and Consumer Reports. Reddit is once again Perplexity's preferred site.

Perplexity recently announced that it will soon display branded ads on its search results. The company will show native ads in related questions, allowing advertisers to influence what follow-up queries are displayed. While this move appears antithetical to Perplexity's claim that search should be ""free from the influence of advertising-driven models,"" Perplexity's Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko tells AdWeek that advertising was ""always part of how we're going to build a great business.""

If this evolves beyond native ads or sponsored questions, could there be an equivalent of Google AdWords on Perplexity? Though far from the scale, this might make the AI app more like Google and draw more interest from digital marketers.

In conclusion, the rise of AI in search engines has the potential to disrupt the traditional SEO landscape. While it's crucial for companies to continue investing in SEO, they must also adapt their strategies to stay ahead of the curve. By focusing on the topics they have the right to win in and building relationships with online communities, companies can leverage the power of AI to gain a competitive edge in the search market.

Microsoft & Quantinuum Achieve 800x Lower Error Rate with Virtual Qubits

Microsoft's and Quantinuum's breakthrough in quantum computing could mark the beginning of practical applications. By grouping physical qubits into virtual qubits, they achieved an error rate 800 times better than relying on physical qubits alone. This milestone brings us closer to Level 2 Resilient quantum computing, enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing for real-world solutions.","Title: A Leap Forward in Quantum Computing: Microsoft and Quantinuum's Error-Free System

Introduction

Quantum computing, a concept that once seemed like science fiction, has been making significant strides in recent years. The potential of quantum computers to solve complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers has captured the imagination of scientists and tech enthusiasts alike. However, the reality is that quantum computers, known as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, are still not ready for practical applications due to errors in qubits. Now, Microsoft and Quantinuum have announced a major breakthrough, claiming to have developed the most error-free quantum computing system to date.

The Challenge of Quantum Computing

Classical computers and electronics rely on binary bits, which can be either on or off. In contrast, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in a superposition of two states simultaneously. This unique property of qubits enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations at an unprecedented speed. However, qubits are prone to errors, which makes today's quantum computers unsuitable for practical uses.

Microsoft's Solution: Virtual Qubits

Microsoft's approach to tackling the error problem in qubits is to group physical qubits into virtual qubits. This method allows for error diagnostics and correction without destroying the qubits. By running this system over Quantinuum's hardware, Microsoft was able to achieve an error rate that was 800 times better than relying on physical qubits alone. As a result, Microsoft claims to have run more than 14,000 experiments without any errors.

The Path to Practical Quantum Computing

The error-free quantum computing system developed by Microsoft and Quantinuum could pave the way for practical applications. According to Jason Zander, EVP of Microsoft's Strategic Missions and Technologies division, this achievement brings us closer to ""Level 2 Resilient"" quantum computing, which would be reliable enough for practical uses.

The quantum ecosystem must work towards increasing the fidelity of qubits and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing to unlock solutions to previously intractable problems. This involves transitioning to reliable logical qubits, which are created by combining multiple physical qubits together to protect against noise and sustain long computations.

Meta's image generator has a serious flaw. It struggles with the concept of intermarriage and repeatedly delivers back-to-back images of two Asians. In fact, the bot only returned an accurate image once - and that too was far from perfect. This is a stark reminder that AI, like all technology, is only as good as the data it's trained on and the biases of its creators and trainers.

In a report for The Verge, Mia Sato shares her experiences trying to create an image of an East Asian man with a Caucasian woman using Meta's image generator. Despite using various prompts, the bot kept delivering images of two Asians. Even when she used ""Asian man and white wife"" or ""Asian man and Caucasian woman on wedding day,"" the bot would still return images of two Asians.

The issue goes beyond just intermarriage. The bot also reinforced biases around skin tone, culturally-specific clothing, and even age. When prompted with ""Asian woman,"" the bot returned East Asian-looking faces with light complexions. It also added culturally-specific clothing even when not prompted to do so, such as a bindi or a sari. Moreover, the bot seemed to blend culturally different areas of Asia together, creating a mashup of a qipao and a kimono.

This is not just a technical issue, but a reflection of societal biases. AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they're trained on, and the creators and trainers themselves. The diverse Asian population is a testament to this, as ""Asian"" is a blanket term that doesn't account for the vast differences within the continent.

Sato's findings reinforce the need for a more diversity-conscious approach in the development and training of AI systems. We need to ensure that our technology reflects the complexities and nuances of the world we live in, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases.

But who decides when AGI is attained?, Achieving Artificial General Intelligence: Challenges and Progress ,"Title: The Pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence: A New Frontier in AI Research

Introduction

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), also known as ""strong"" AI, is a concept that has been captivating the scientific community for decades. It refers to machines that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like humans do. The idea is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction, with tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft investing heavily in its development. However, the path to achieving AGI is fraught with challenges and controversies. This article will delve into the definition, progress, and potential implications of AGI.

What is AGI?

AGI is not merely a more advanced version of the AI systems that we are familiar with today. Instead, it is a holistic form of intelligence that encompasses a wide range of cognitive abilities, including reasoning, planning, learning, and understanding context. As Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist, puts it, AGI is ""AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do."" Hinton prefers the term ""superintelligence"" for AGIs that surpass human intelligence.

The term AGI harks back to the early days of AI research, before it branched into specialized and commercially viable subfields such as facial recognition and voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The ""G"" in AGI signifies the ambitious vision of building a thinking machine, as opposed to merely creating tools to perform specific tasks.

However, AGI remains a nebulous concept, with no clear definition or consensus on what it entails. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine when AGI has been achieved. As Hinton notes, ""twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google's) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.""

Progress Towards AGI

Despite the challenges, progress towards AGI is being made. Advances in ""autoregressive"" AI techniques, which predict the most plausible next word in a sequence, combined with massive computing power to train these systems on vast amounts of data,",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/tech-companies-want-to.jpg,2024-04-04 14:15:03,"""Discover the latest breakthroughs in Artificial General Intelligence!

Google, the search engine titan, has long held its position as the dominant force in the industry. However, with the emergence of advanced AI models threatening to disrupt its business, Google is contemplating introducing a paywall for premium generative AI features in its search engine.

A recent report by the Financial Times reveals that Google is exploring the possibility of adding a paywall to access new AI-powered search features. These enhanced features would be integrated into Google's premium subscription service, Google One, which was launched in February. Although engineers are actively working on the technology, Google executives are yet to make a final decision on the implementation of the paywall.

The Google One plan, priced at $20 per month, currently offers users a host of benefits, including access to Gemini for Workspace (previously known as Duet AI), which integrates AI assistance across Google's productivity apps like Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Meet. Other perks of the AI Premium Plan include 2TB of storage, Google Photos editing features, Google Store rewards, Google Meet premium video calling features, and Google Calendar enhanced appointment scheduling.

Despite the potential introduction of a paid search tier, Google's traditional search engine will remain free and ad-supported. However, this move towards a paid search model represents a significant departure from Google's long-standing business strategy, which has kept its search engine free since its inception over two decades ago.

The primary reason behind this potential shift is the high cost of deploying and maintaining generative AI features on its search engine. The subscription fee could help offset these costs. However, there is no guarantee that users would be willing to pay for such an AI-assisted search service, especially with numerous free alternatives available in the market.

For instance, ChatGPT, a popular AI chatbot, recently simplified user access by eliminating the need for logins. This move allows users to ask ChatGPT questions in the same way they would ask Google, by merely visiting the site and typing into the chatbot. Despite Google's advantage of having no knowledge cutoff, ChatGPT remains an attractive option for users seeking comprehensive and conversational responses on topics before January 2022.
