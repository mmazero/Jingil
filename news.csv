Introduction

In a bold move, TikTok, the popular social media platform, has declared a new bill seeking to ban the app in the U.S. as ""unconstitutional."" The company, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, vows to challenge this legislation in court. This isn't the first time TikTok has faced a ban, with similar attempts made during the Trump administration. However, the company argues that a ban infringes upon the First Amendment rights of both the corporation and its users.

The Unconstitutional Argument Against a Ban

TikTok's challenge to the bill is based on the argument that both the corporation and its users have First Amendment rights, which a ban would threaten. This viewpoint is backed by Douglas E. Mirell, partner at Greenberg Glusker, who believes that this latest legislation suffers from the same ""fundamental infirmity"" as the Trump administration's attempt to force ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban in 2020.

A Montana state law seeking to ban TikTok was challenged in court by the company and five TikTok creators, arguing a violation of First Amendment rights. The case is ongoing, but a U.S. federal judge blocked the ban, claiming it was an overstep of state power and unconstitutional. This ruling sets a precedent for future cases, which TikTok will likely use in its challenge against the federal bill.

Impact on Small Businesses

TikTok may also argue that a ban would negatively impact small and medium-sized businesses that use the platform to generate income. The company recently released an economic impact report claiming that TikTok generated $14.7 billion for such businesses in 2022, providing further ammunition for its case against a potential ban.

The National Security Threat

While courts generally give deference to the government's claims about entities posing a national security threat, TikTok can argue that the evidence presented thus far is insufficient to justify a ban. For instance, federal judges previously issued preliminary injunctions to block Trump's ban, citing concerns about violation of First Amendment rights and lack of sufficient evidence demonstrating a national security threat.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-simple-fuel-generation.html,A simple 'twist' improves the engine of clean fuel generation, Twist in Copper Oxide Crystals Boosts Clean Fuel Production by 70% ,"Title: Supercharging Sustainable Fuel Generation: A Twist in the Tale

Researchers from the University of Cambridge have made a significant breakthrough in the field of clean energy production. They have discovered a method to enhance the efficiency of sustainable fuel generation by manipulating the crystallographic orientation of light-harvesting semiconductors. This innovation could potentially power devices that convert water into hydrogen fuel, utilizing only solar energy.

Copper oxides, the semiconducting materials in question, are abundant, inexpensive, and non-toxic. However, their performance pales in comparison to silicon, which dominates the semiconductor market. The researchers found that by growing copper oxide crystals in a specific orientation, the electric charges move faster and further, significantly improving performance.

The team engineered a copper oxide light harvester, or photocathode, using this fabrication technique. The results were promising, with a 70% improvement in performance over existing state-of-the-art oxide photocathodes. Additionally, the new photocathodes showed improved stability, a critical factor for practical applications.

Copper (I) oxide, or cuprous oxide, has been a subject of interest for years due to its potential as a cheap alternative to silicon. However, its performance is often hindered by charge loss. The researchers addressed this issue by optimizing the crystals' growth to efficiently generate and move electric charges when sunlight hits the material.

The team grew high-quality cuprous oxide films at ambient pressure and room temperature using thin film deposition techniques. By controlling growth and flow rates, they were able to 'shift' the crystals into a specific orientation. High temporal resolution spectroscopic techniques then revealed how the crystals' orientation affected charge movement.

The researchers found that when electrons moved through the cube at a body diagonal, they traveled an order of magnitude further, leading to improved performance. This diagonal direction in these materials proved to be a game-changer, resulting in a substantial increase in performance.

The new orientation also improved the films' stability. However, factors beyond the bulk properties may contribute to this stability, and further research is needed.

This breakthrough could play a crucial role in the transition from fossil fuels to clean, sustainable fuels compatible with existing energy infrastructure. While there'",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-simple-twist-improve.jpg,2024-04-24 11:00:01,"Meta Description:

In a groundbreaking study, scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have uncovered an exciting opportunity for countries to capitalize on renewable energy sources and create more cost-effective green value chains. The research, published in Nature Energy, highlights the potential for countries with limited renewable energy capabilities to save up to 20% on green steel production costs and up to 40% on green chemicals by importing from countries with abundant and cheaper renewable energy.

The Key Findings

1. Renewables Pull: By relocating energy-intensive production to countries with abundant and cheaper renewable energy, renewable-scarce countries like parts of the EU, Japan, and South Korea could achieve cost savings of 18% to 38% on industrial basic materials like green steel and chemicals based on green hydrogen.
2. Green Hydrogen Imports: Importing hydrogen-based industrial intermediate goods, such as iron sponge, ammonia, or methanol, and focusing on downstream production and refinement could be a more cost-effective strategy for securing competitiveness than producing green hydrogen domestically or importing it.
3. Global Reconfiguration: The researchers anticipate a global reconfiguration of trade and production in energy-intensive industry sectors, with production shifting towards countries abundant in renewable resources and moving away from regions facing constraints.

The Implications

This study offers a new perspective on how countries can transition towards more sustainable industrial practices. By taking advantage of the disparities in renewable energy costs and availability, countries can create a win-win scenario for both importers and exporters. Developing countries with cheap access to renewables can become exporters, driving industrialization and economic growth. At the same time, industrialized countries can focus on activities that create the most economic value from scarce and expensive green energy, such as making green steel from sponge iron and processing it further.

Moreover, this shift in production could lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, further contributing to global efforts in combating climate change.

Graphical abstract. Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2024). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.3c17049

In the pursuit of optimizing grid-scale energy storage systems, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have emerged as a promising solution for addressing the challenges associated with renewable energy sources' fluctuations and intermittency. These batteries are renowned for their high efficiency, scalability, safety, and near-room-temperature operation conditions. Moreover, VRFBs offer the unique advantage of independently sizing power and energy capacities, making them an attractive option for grid-scale applications.

At the heart of VRFBs are redox reactions that occur at the surfaces of electrodes in contact with the electrolyte. Modifying the electrode surface can significantly affect the electrochemical activity and overall battery performance. Recognizing this, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) embarked on a journey to enhance the lifespan of VRFBs by investigating the surface functionality of carbon electrodes and their propensity for degradation during electrochemical cycles.

The team's research, published in the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, employed a coupled experimental–theoretical approach based on carbon K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize carbon electrodes prepared under different conditions. This method allowed the team to identify relevant functional groups responsible for unique spectroscopic features and pinpoint the active species present on the carbon electrodes, which play a crucial role in determining their electrochemical performance.

XAS proved to be an ideal choice for these experiments, as it is particularly effective for investigating carbon electrode composition. The technique provides element-specific local electronic structure (and, therefore, bonding environment) and the capability for depth profiling, enabling comparison of the surface and bulk electrode composition.

To further understand the carbon electrode's behavior, the LLNL team, led by Sabrina Wan, conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology, electrical components that can store and release energy rapidly are essential. These components, known as capacitors, play a crucial role in various applications, including pacemakers, defibrillators, radar technology, and electric vehicles. Researchers at the University of Twente have recently developed a groundbreaking design strategy to optimize the energy storage capacity, efficiency, and durability of these vital components.

The Need for High-Performance Capacitors

Pacemakers, which help regulate heartbeats, are just one example of the many devices that rely on capacitors. These small electrical components charge and discharge rapidly to deliver high-energy pulses that reset the heart's rhythm. To function optimally, pacemaker capacitors must be efficient, charge quickly, and have a long lifespan. As Minh Duc Nguyen, a researcher involved in the study, explains, ""It needs to keep up with your heartbeat, so it should be able to charge and discharge up to billions of times. Otherwise, you'll have to replace the pacemaker every few months.""

A New Design Strategy

To address the challenges of current capacitor designs, Nguyen and his team focused on multilayer capacitors, which consist of multiple thin layers of different materials. By adding layers, they were able to increase the efficiency to more than 90%, reducing energy loss by two times compared to traditional designs. The new capacitors also function in a wide temperature range (25°C–200°C) and can charge and discharge up to 10 billion times. This is equivalent to doing it once every second for more than 300 years.

Design Optimization Rules

The researchers also established design optimization rules for the combination of materials used in their multilayer capacitors. These rules can be applied to other multilayer systems, paving the way for further increases in energy storage density and even better capacitors. The team's findings are published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Introduction

For decades, robotics engineers have endeavored to create machines capable of matching the grace and agility of animals. However, despite substantial investments and research, robots still lag far behind their natural counterparts. To uncover the reasons behind this gap, an international team of scientists and engineers analyzed various aspects of running robots and compared them to animals in a study published in Science Robotics. This article will discuss the findings of their research, focusing on the differences between robotics and animal locomotion and how robotics can benefit from understanding and emulating biological systems.

The Study

The research team, comprising experts from five universities, examined five ""subsystems"" of running robots and compared them with their biological counterparts. These subsystems include Power, Frame, Actuation, Sensing, and Control. The goal was to determine where animals excel and why robots fall short, particularly in terms of endurance, agility, and robustness.

The Power subsystem deals with the generation and storage of energy required for movement. While engineered parts outperformed biological systems in this aspect, animals' efficiency in energy management remains unmatched. The Frame subsystem concerns the structure and design of robots or animals. In this category, robots have an edge due to technological advancements and materials science.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-explores-human-machines-eerie.html,Study explores why human-inspired machines can be perceived as eerie," AI Robots, Mind Perception, and the Uncanny Valley: New Study Challenges Existing Theories ","[Introduction]

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), robots are increasingly mimicking human behaviors, leading to a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley. This term refers to the eerie and unsettling feeling we experience when AI systems become too human-like. To delve deeper into what makes some robots and AI systems feel unnerving, Karl F. MacDorman, an associate professor at Indiana's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, has conducted extensive research on this topic.

[Mind Perception Theory and the Uncanny Valley]

MacDorman's latest paper, published in Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans, investigates the mind perception theory, which posits that people feel eeriness when exposed to robots that closely resemble humans because they ascribe minds to these robots. As he explains, ""For many Westerners, the idea of a machine with conscious experience is unsettling."" This discomfort extends to inanimate objects as well, making AI systems that communicate like humans even more unsettling.

[Language Models and Sentience]

Language learning models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are advanced natural language processing (NLP) models that can generate human-like responses. These models are trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to answer user queries in a conversational manner. The language they use and their ability to generate query-specific content could make them easier to mistake for sentient beings.

[Questioning Mind Perception Theory]

In 2012, researchers from Harvard University and the University of North Carolina explored the concept of the uncanny valley. Skeptical of the mind perception theory as the root cause of the uncanny valley, MacDorman designed new studies to test its existence and validity.

[Experimental Design and Results]

Through a mixed-effects meta-regression model, MacDorman identified shortcomings in past mind perception experiments, including the disconnection between the manipulation of experimental conditions and the appearance of an AI system. His own experiment involved convincing a group of participants to either ascribe more sentience to robots or less, then comparing how eerie the same robots were perceived by both groups.

In today's digital age, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are embracing various enterprise applications to streamline their operations. However, a concerning trend has emerged: despite being prime targets for cybercriminals, SMBs are prioritizing other applications over security tools. In Singapore, the Infocomm Media Development Authority's (IMDA) SME Go Digital program offers grants for a range of enterprise applications, including cybersecurity. Yet, according to Andy Choi, deputy director of SME Go Digital, cybersecurity tools rank low in adoption among SMBs.

The Reality of Cybersecurity Threats for SMBs

With smaller businesses attracting cybercriminals due to their limited resources and skills to secure assets, it's crucial for SMBs to recognize the risks associated with their digital transformation efforts. Cyber attackers no longer simply breach networks; they steal credentials and hijack data to exploit victims for ransom. Kevin Reed, CISO for data security vendor Acronis, highlighted that while significant ransom payments make headlines, most ransom payouts cater to SMBs, making them a lucrative target for cybercriminals.

The Growing Prevalence of Ransomware Attacks

Ransomware attacks pose the most significant threat to SMBs, as reported in the 2024 Sophos Threat Report. These attacks often involve data or credential theft, leading to financial losses and potential regulatory violations. According to Christopher Budd, Sophos' Director of X-Ops Research, more than 90% of all cyberattacks reported to Sophos last year involved data or credential theft. Specifically, LockBit, Akira, and BlackCat are the top three ransomware groups targeting SMBs.

Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenges for SMBs

To mitigate the risks of ransomware attacks, SMBs must prioritize cybersecurity measures and invest in appropriate tools and resources. Collaborating with local authorities and tapping into community support can provide valuable background data and information sharing, aiding in mitigation and recovery efforts. Furthermore, SMBs should consider the potential legal and regulatory implications of making ransom payments, as they may face charges for funding terrorism or",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/5030c90f1966c28e0a105b88180cc85323277ac4/2024/04/25/f53351ad-6d72-447e-a4e3-0d6c02af6fca/padlockhole2gettyimages-473158924.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-25 00:00:00,"""Protect your SMB from ransomware attacks: Prioritize cybersecurity now!

Introduction:

Imagine a future where air taxis and autonomous drones zip through the skies, ferrying passengers and cargo between urban locations, bypassing the earthbound traffic below. This vision is fast becoming a reality, with companies developing hybrid electric ""flying cars"" that take off and land vertically while efficiently soaring through the air for longer distances. However, ensuring the safety of these aerial vehicles is of paramount importance, as they must be able to handle disturbances and potential failures without compromising control and stability.

A team of engineers at Caltech, led by Soon-Jo Chung, has developed an onboard Machine Learning-based control method called ""Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance"" (NFFT). This groundbreaking system enables aircraft to detect and compensate for disturbances, significantly enhancing their resilience against a variety of faults.

The Challenge of Redundancy and Failure Detection:

To reduce energy consumption during urban flights, engineers are designing hybrid-electric aircraft with multiple propellers, or rotors, for redundancy. However, the inclusion of both rotors and wings creates numerous points of possible failure in each aircraft. Detecting these failures is a significant challenge, as a comprehensive sensor system would be expensive, difficult to manage, and would add weight to the aircraft.

Introducing NFFT: A Deep Learning Solution:

Chung's group has developed a deep-learning method that can detect aircraft failures in real-time without requiring additional sensors or hardware. NFFT relies on a neural network pre-trained on real-life flight data, which adapts and learns based on changing parameters, including an estimation of the effectiveness of each rotor.

Virtual Sensors and Real-time Control:

NFFT's real-time control signals and algorithms function as virtual sensors, detecting failures and enabling swift compensation. This innovative approach has been tested on Caltech's Autonomous Flying Ambulance, a hybrid electric vehicle designed to transport injured or ill people to hospitals quickly.
