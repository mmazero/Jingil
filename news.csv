Introduction

In a breakthrough for medical technologies and robotic systems, researchers from Meta AI, Stanford University, Technische Universität Dresden, and the German Cancer Research Center (DFKZ) have developed DIGIT Pinki, a miniature-sized tactile sensor that mimics human touch. This sensor, presented in a paper on the preprint server arXiv, could revolutionize various fields by providing a better sense of touch for robots and medical devices. In this article, we'll delve into the fascinating world of tactile sensing, the development of DIGIT Pinki, and its potential applications in the future.

The Science of Digitizing Touch

The research behind DIGIT Pinki began as an internship at Meta AI with Roberto Calandra and Mike Lambeta. As the project grew, it evolved into a collaboration between these institutions with the primary goal of exploring the science of digitizing touch for robots. The researchers wanted to create sensors with touch capabilities similar to those of humans but in the form factor of a human finger.

Building on Existing Designs

DIGIT Pinki builds on recent tactile sensor designs, such as the DIGIT and OmniTact sensors, but also revisits older ideas from the 1980s. The team was inspired by a seminal paper by S. Begej, incorporating elements from earlier designs into their new sensor.

What is DIGIT Pinki?

DIGIT Pinki is a vision-based tactile sensor that uses images from a miniature camera to detect touch. These sensors typically consist of an optically clear gel fingertip. When the gel fingertip touches an object, an internal camera with lights captures images of the resulting deformations in the gel.

Machine Learning Algorithm

The researchers trained a machine learning algorithm on the deformations of the sensor's gel, produced when the sensor makes contact with an object. The trained algorithm can accurately learn tactile information, such as the contact forces with an object, from the image data collected by the sensor. This tactile information could then be used by a robot or device to complete manipulation tasks.

Let's dive into its potential impact on external interfaces, APIs, libraries, and development tools.","Title: The Intricate Art of Programming: A Coffee-Fueled Analogy

Introduction

Have you ever thought about how making a cup of coffee is a lot like programming? At first glance, these two activities might seem unrelated, but when we break them down to their fundamental components, the parallels become clear. This post will explore these similarities and discuss the complexities of programming, including external interfaces, APIs, libraries, and development tools.

The Coffee-Programming Analogy

To begin, let's consider the process of making coffee. You choose a coffee pod, insert it into the machine, add water, and wait for the brew. This sequence of steps is not unlike programming, where you follow a set of instructions to achieve a specific outcome. However, programming has evolved beyond merely describing steps; it now involves interacting with a wide range of external factors.

External Interfaces and Real-World Connections

Suppose you're trying to program a robot to move its legs. You could develop the physics-based control details, or you could use pre-existing programs created by someone else. This situation is similar to using coffee pods, which are a standardized system (e.g., K-cups from Keurig). Programming often requires using external routines from vendors, which involves trade-offs such as vendor restrictions, cost, loss of control, and update frequency.

APIs and Libraries: Simplifying Complexity

Programmers use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and libraries to link together different components, saving time and effort. However, not all APIs and libraries work with all programming environments, requiring programmers to use multiple languages and interface with various systems. This complexity often leads to bugs and time spent debugging, making the process tedious and unenjoyable.

Development Tools: Managing Complexity

Programmers use various tools to manage complexity, such as interactive development environments, source code control tools, and symbolic debuggers. While these tools help streamline the process, they don't eliminate the challenges of working with multiple APIs, libraries, and programming languages.

Summary: Engineers from MIT develop innovative flexure springs to optimize muscle tissue integration in robotic systems, increasing efficiency and precision.","Title: A New Era of Muscle-Powered Robots: The Flexure Spring

Introduction

Muscles, nature's actuators, have long been a subject of interest for engineers looking to harness their power and precision for robotics. Muscle-based actuators offer numerous advantages over synthetic counterparts, including self-healing and growth strengthening capabilities. However, integrating muscles into robotics has posed challenges due to the lack of a universal blueprint for maximizing their potential in various designs. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have recently developed a groundbreaking spring-like device, dubbed the flexure, aimed at addressing this issue.

The Flexure Spring: A Muscle-Powered Breakthrough

Muscles are inherently powerful and accurate, but their contractions are not always harnessed effectively in robotics applications. The new flexure spring, designed by MIT engineers, provides a modular solution for integrating muscle tissues into artificial skeletons, enhancing the efficiency of these biohybrid robots.

The flexure spring's primary function is to maximize the work output of any attached muscle tissues, allowing for increased movement and precision. When a ring of muscle tissue is fitted onto the device, it pulls on the spring in a reliable and repeatable manner, stretching it five times further than previous designs.

A Building Block for the Future

Ritu Raman, the Brit and Alex d'Arbeloff Career Development Professor in Engineering Design at MIT, envisions the flexure design as a fundamental building block for creating various configurations of muscle-powered robots. This new skeleton-like module can be combined with other flexures to build a wide range of artificial skeletons tailored for specific applications.

""These flexures are like a skeleton that people can now use to turn muscle actuation into multiple degrees of freedom of motion in a very predictable way,"" Raman explains. ""We are giving roboticists a new set of rules to make powerful and precise muscle-powered robots that do interesting things.""

Biped climbing robots hold immense potential for completing maintenance tasks on tall structures, delivering packages to challenging-to-reach locations, and providing survival kits in high-risk environments. To effectively carry out these tasks, these robots must possess the ability to sense, map, and accurately predict their location within their surroundings.

Researchers at the Guangdong University of Technology have recently developed a novel method to improve a biped climbing robot's (BiCR) capacity to estimate its state and map its environment while ascending a truss structure. Their proposed method, published in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, employs a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm tailored specifically for the BiCR.

The team's primary objective was to enable the BiCR to autonomously localize itself and generate a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures. The SLAM-based approach they propose was specifically designed for the BiCR, a bipedal climbing robot previously developed at their lab.

The researchers introduced BiCR-SLAM, a SLAM system that combines the BiCR robot's configuration data, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras to localize the robot and map the truss it is climbing. The framework creates a pole map surrounding the gripper, allowing the robot to plan its actions more effectively during the climbing process.

BiCR-SLAM consists of four components: an encoder dead reckoning, a LiDAR odometry estimation tool, a pole landmark mapping model, and a global optimization technique. In the global optimization, the team proposes a multi-source fusion factor graph to jointly optimize the robot localization and pole landmarks.

A significant advantage of BiCR-SLAM is its ability to consider both the bipedal robot's joint information and sensor data concurrently. This capability enables the BiCR robot to map its surroundings, predict its pose, and plan its next moves, allowing it to climb a truss safely. Moreover, the system can maintain functionality in low-texture and single-structure truss environments.

The researchers believe that their SLAM method can pave the way for advancements in BiCR and SLAM development, significantly improving the localization and navigation",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-fusion-slam-system-t-1.jpg,2024-04-08 07:50:01,"""Discover how BiCR-SLAM revolutionizes biped climbing robots' navigation on truss structures - read now!"""," ""Biped Climbing"" ",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

(47 characters)","THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION REGIME FACES STIFF CHALLENGES FROM INDUSTRY LOBBYISTS

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiórowski, has raised concerns about certain fundamental aspects of the European Union's (EU) data protection and privacy regulations being threatened by industry lobbyists. These crucial components, such as the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, might encounter severe opposition from legislators in the upcoming parliamentary term. This article delves into the potential modifications to the EU's high standards for data protection and their consequences for individuals across the region.

KEY PRINCIPLES UNDER THREAT
--------------------------

During a meeting with the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee, Wiewiórowski acknowledged the increasing pressure on the GDPR's core principles, specifically focusing on purpose limitation. According to him, ""Purpose limitation will be definitely questioned in the next years."" The GDPR stipulates that data operations must adhere to a particular objective; however, further processing is allowed if consent is obtained or based on a legitimate ground. This purposive approach deliberately introduces friction into data activities, ensuring greater individual control and privacy rights.

SHIFTING PARLIAMENTARY AND COMMISSION LANDSCAPE
-----------------------------------------------

With elections to the European Parliament scheduled for June and the Commission's mandate ending in late 2024, changes in both the parliament and commission are imminent. Newly elected officials might bring fresh perspectives regarding data protection regulation, potentially impacting the region's stringent privacy requirements. However, according to Wiewiórowski, many of the incoming parliamentarians would view the GDPR as a historical milestone, opening the door for debates on its relevance and effectiveness.

LOBBYING EFFORTS TARGETING PURPOSE LIMITATION
---------------------------------------------

Industry lobbying, notably criticisms from organizations seeking relaxation of the GDPR's purpose limitation principle, pose a substantial challenge to the existing data protection framework. Certain sectors argue that the ability to reuse collected data without explicit prior consent hinders innovation and growth. Wiewiórowski emphasized the widespread desire within industries to repurpose data initially gathered for one goal towards unknown future purposes. Despite opposing this stance, Wiewiórowski conceded that addressing these concerns remains essential.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIVACY AND DATA MINIMIZATION

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/cruise-robotaxis-are-back-sort-of/,GM's Cruise robotaxis are back in Phoenix - but people are driving them, Cruise's Cautious Growth: New Era of Safety Measures & Human-Driven Robotaxis ,"Title: Cruise Hits the Reset Button: A New Era of Cautious Growth and Safety Measures

After a hiatus of almost five months, General Motors' (GM) self-driving unit, Cruise, recently announced the resumption of its autonomous vehicle (AV) operations in Phoenix. However, this time around, the robotaxis will not be driving themselves. Instead, Cruise will use human drivers to collect crucial data for mapping and gathering essential road information in various cities, beginning with Phoenix. This move signifies a significant shift in the company's strategy, emphasizing cautious expansion and enhanced safety measures.

Previously, Cruise had adopted an ambitious growth plan, rapidly launching services in multiple cities while critics raised concerns regarding the company's swift expansion and potential compromises on safety standards. Following an unfortunate incident in San Francisco involving a pedestrian getting trapped beneath a Cruise robotaxi, the company decided to pause all U.S.-based operations and regroup.

Kyle Vogt, the ex-CEO and co-founder of Cruise, previously explained that the company aimed to expand carefully by adopting successful strategies from one city—San Francisco—to other comparable ride-sharing markets. Taking a cue from this vision, Cruise's recent blog post highlights the importance of collecting precise location data related to roads and their features, such as speed limits and lane markings. By doing so, the company intends to establish a strong foundation upon which it can build a robust and reliable AV network gradually.

To achieve its goals, Cruise has laid out several key objectives in its latest blog post:

1. Identifying accurate and detailed location data for better navigation and understanding of the operating environment;
2. Implementing rigorous testing, monitoring, and evaluation processes to ensure consistent performance and safety improvements;
3. Reintegrating autonomous capabilities in controlled environments under human supervision and oversight;
4. Continuously updating and enhancing the underlying technology and algorithms powering the AV system.

It remains uncertain whether Cruise is simply explaining the fundamentals of developing an AV system for public awareness or if its newly established safety committee is revamping the existing technology stack. Nonetheless, the renewed focus on caution, transparency, and efficiency reflects positively on the company's commitment to providing safe and dependable transportation solutions.

Unfortunately, Cruise encountered numerous technological hiccups even during its rapid expansion phase across major urban centers like San Francisco and Austin. As a result, the company faced disrupted traffic flows, affected public transport schedules, and delayed emergency response times. Furthermore, the fallout worsened due to poor communication surrounding the fatal October incident, drawing criticism from regulators accusing Cruise of concealing vital details about the collision. Consequently, parent company GM intervened, reducing investments and assuming tighter controls over Cruise's operations.

As part of its freshly defined strategy, Cruise aims to address past shortcomings through three primary initiatives:

1. Establishing streamlined and effective incident response and crisis management procedures to guarantee timely and open communications;
2. Strengthening partnerships with local authorities and first responders via collaborative training programs tailored to every district earmarked for operation;
3. Prioritizing long-term sustainability and success over immediate profits and market dominance.

Although Cruise hasn't revealed its plans for restarting driverless operations, the company did begin increasing its paid service area near Phoenix in August 2023. Meanwhile, rival Waymo, currently operational in San Francisco, continues offering a paid, driverless robotaxi service throughout the region and has even broadened its service area in downtown Phoenix and introduced driverless trips to the airport.

Despite facing setbacks, Cruise demonstrates determination in learning valuable lessons and emerging stronger than ever. With its strategic reset, the company now embraces cautious development and prioritizes safety above all else, positioning itself for a sustainable and prosperous future in the competitive world of autonomous mobility.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1189070710.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-09 18:40:11,"""Cruise resumes Phoenix operations with human-driven robotaxis, focusing on cautious growth and safety.
