In the world of artificial intelligence, a new player has emerged, challenging the dominance of OpenAI and Anthropic. Mistral AI, a Paris-based startup, has unveiled its latest creation: Mistral Large, a flagship large language model that promises to rival the likes of GPT-4 and Claude 2 in terms of reasoning capabilities.

Alongside Mistral Large, the company has also introduced Le Chat, its very own alternative to ChatGPT, currently in beta. Mistral AI's rapid ascent has been fueled by an impressive influx of funding, starting with a $113 million seed round in May 2023, followed by a $415 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz in December.

Initially positioning itself as an open-source AI company, Mistral AI has shifted its strategy, offering Mistral Large through a paid API with usage-based pricing. This move mirrors OpenAI's business model, with Mistral Large costing $8 per million input tokens and $24 per million output tokens.

While Mistral Large supports a wide range of languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian, it currently lags behind GPT-4 in terms of pricing. However, Mistral AI claims that its model ranks second to GPT-4 based on several benchmarks, although real-life usage disparities may exist.

Mistral AI's Le Chat chat assistant is free to use for now, allowing users to interact with three different models: Mistral Small, Mistral Large, and Mistral Next, a prototype model designed for brevity and conciseness. Le Chat's beta release is accessible at chat.mistral.ai, though users should expect some quirks.

To cater to enterprise clients, Mistral AI plans to introduce a paid version of Le Chat, offering features such as central billing and moderation mechanisms.

In a significant development, Mistral AI has forged a partnership with Microsoft, which will make Mistral models available to Azure customers. This collaboration opens up new opportunities for Mistral AI to expand its reach and attract more customers.

For Microsoft, this partnership aligns with its strategy of maintaining a diverse model catalog on Azure, keeping its customers within its product ecosystem. It also helps Microsoft navigate potential anticompetitive scrutiny.

As the AI landscape continues to evolve, Mistral AI's entry into the market adds a new dimension to the competition. With its ambitious goals and strategic partnerships, Mistral AI is poised to make waves in the industry and challenge the established players.
