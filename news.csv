https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-coffee-roastery-finland-ai-generated.html,A coffee roastery in Finland has launched an AI-generated blend. The results were surprising, AI Unveils Unique Coffee Blend in Finland: Kaffa's AI-conic Brew ,"Title: Brewing Innovation: The AI-Driven Coffee Revolution

Artisanal coffee roastery Kaffa, based in Helsinki, Finland, has recently unveiled an exciting new blend developed by artificial intelligence. This pioneering initiative aims to ease the workload in a sector that cherishes manual craftsmanship while demonstrating the potential of technology in the world of coffee.

Finland, a nation of 5.6 million, is renowned for its coffee consumption, with an annual average of 12 kilograms per capita, according to the International Coffee Organization. It is only fitting that the AI-conic blend was launched in this Nordic country, where coffee culture runs deep.

The result of a partnership between Kaffa and local AI consultancy Elev, the AI-conic blend is a unique four-bean mixture dominated by velvety Fazenda Pinhal beans from Brazil. To create this innovative blend, AI analyzed descriptions and flavors of various coffee types and crafted a new and exciting blend that would cater to coffee enthusiasts' tastes.

Svante Hampf, Kaffa's managing director and founder, shared that the primary objective was to explore how AI could aid in coffee roasting, an artisan profession highly valued in Finland. With detailed coffee type descriptions and flavor profiles, the AI was tasked with creating a unique blend, which it did by choosing beans from Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Guatemala.

Interestingly, the AI also designed the package label and a detailed taste description for the AI-conic blend, describing it as ""a well-balanced blend of sweetness and ripe fruit."" Hampf admitted to being surprised that the AI selected four different coffee beans for the blend, as roasteries usually work with two or three to distinguish flavors from various origins.

After the initial test roasting and blind testing, Kaffa's coffee experts agreed that the tech-assisted blend was a success, requiring no human adjustments. Antti Merilehto, Elev's spokesman, emphasized the value of AI in introducing new perspectives for seasoned professionals and offering coffee lovers novel taste experiences.

Kaffa Roastery hopes that this trial will spark a dialogue between coffee professionals about the future of coffee in Finland, a country with a strong coffee culture and a thriving tech startup",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-coffee-roastery-in-f.jpg,2024-04-21 05:41:40,"scene.

Introduction:
In today's competitive market, certain companies have reaped the benefits of tight integration â€“ designing and building crucial components in-house. Prominent examples include Apple's custom microprocessors and Tesla's Superchargers. However, a relatively new startup, General Galactic, has decided to take on this challenging approach to drive down the cost of a promising technology: [Methane Production] from carbon dioxide. This article explores General Galactic's innovative strategy and its ambitious goals.

The Inception of General Galactic:
General Galactic's co-founder and CEO, Halen Mattison, conceived the idea during his time at SpaceX. His work on propellant generation for Starship sparked curiosity about producing fuel for the return journey to Mars. However, SpaceX deemed it too tangential and not a priority at the time. Mattison, who was leaving SpaceX to attend Stanford, met Luke Neise, and together they founded General Galactic in 2022.

The Vision and Funding:
General Galactic's ultimate goal is to manufacture [methane] at a lower cost than extracting it from the ground. This would involve capturing carbon dioxide from the air, producing hydrogen from water, and combining them to form methane using renewable energy. To achieve this, the company raised a $1.9 million pre-seed round in July 2023 from venture capital firms like Box Group and Refactor.

The In-house Integration Advantage:
Unlike other companies focusing on individual components of [methane production], General Galactic aims to design and develop the entire system in-house. By integrating the entire stack and selling only the fuel, not the equipment, the startup can prioritize driving down costs. This strategy, Mattison believes, will minimize costs and create a more significant incentive for the company to innovate.

Modular Components:
General Galactic plans to modularize each key component, making them easier to mass-produce, transport, and install. This approach has become increasingly popular among climate tech startups, as it reduces construction costs and simplifies the design and development process. The company has initially focused on the [methane re",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Note: This revised SEO title is 49 characters long, including spaces, and incorporates the main themes of the news article while adhering to the required length.","TikTok, the popular video-sharing platform, is once again under scrutiny from the European Union (EU). The EU has opened a second formal investigation, suspecting TikTok of violating the Digital Services Act (DSA), a framework that governs online content moderation. The Commission is also considering imposing interim measures that might force TikTok to restrict access to the TikTok Lite app in the EU during the investigation.

The EU is concerned about the potential mental health risks posed by the ""task and reward"" feature of TikTok Lite, which allows users to earn points for watching or liking videos, which can then be exchanged for rewards. The Commission has expressed worries that this feature could stimulate addictive behavior, particularly among young users. The EU has given TikTok until April 24 to respond to these concerns, and the app remains accessible for now.

If the EU enforcers find TikTok guilty of breaking the law, ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, could face hefty fines of up to 6% of its global annual turnover. This is the second probe the EU has opened on TikTok, following an ongoing investigation into multiple aspects of its DSA compliance since February.

The EU's first TikTok probe covers various issues, including the protection of minors, advertising transparency, data access for researchers, and the risk management of addictive design and harmful content. The latest investigation will specifically focus on TikTok Lite, which launched earlier this month in France and Spain.

The Commission is concerned that TikTok failed to produce a risk assessment of the ""task and reward"" feature, which it had requested last week. The DSA requires larger platforms like TikTok to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks, such as addictive design that could harm users' mental health. The Commission suspects ByteDance failed to do this before launching TikTok Lite in the two EU markets, potentially infringing the DSA.

The EU's press release also raises concerns about the lack of effective age verification mechanisms on TikTok, an issue that the Commission's first TikTok investigation is examining. If TikTok fails to provide compelling proof of its safety, the EU is prepared to trigger DSA interim measures, including the suspension of the TikTok",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiktok-header.webp?w=1024,2024-04-22 15:36:19,"""General Galactic's In-house Methane Production Strategy: Lower Costs, Innovative Design.

This week's episode of Equity is packed with fascinating insights on market trends, venture capital funds, and emerging startups. So, buckle up and let's dive in!

Market News: Earnings, IPOs, and Bitcoin Halving

The tech world is bracing for a significant week, with earnings reports, initial public offerings (IPOs), and other market movements making headlines. Among the most anticipated announcements are those from major tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple.

Meanwhile, IPOs continue to generate excitement, with companies like ZoomInfo preparing for their market debut. However, it appears that the euphoria surrounding high-flying tech stocks might be coming to an end, as some companies like Lemonade have experienced a decline in their stock prices after initially soaring.

In the cryptocurrency world, the recent bitcoin halving event has had little discernible impact on the value of the digital currency. The halving, which reduces the reward for mining new bitcoins, was expected to drive up the cryptocurrency's price due to supply and demand dynamics. However, the lack of a significant price surge suggests that the market may have already priced in the halving event.

Oura Smart Ring Now Available in Target Stores: A Sign of Growing Acceptance

In a significant development for the wearable technology industry, Oura has announced that its smart ring will be available in select Target stores across the United States. This move follows similar partnerships with Amazon in March and Best Buy last April, further solidifying Oura's presence in the retail space.

A Step Towards Legitimizing Smart Rings

Oura's entry into Target stores is a testament to the company's success in legitimizing the smart ring as a viable alternative to traditional wrist-worn smartwatches and trackers. This achievement is particularly noteworthy, considering that Oura has primarily driven this shift in consumer perception.

Under the leadership of CEO Tom Hale, who assumed the role in 2022, Oura has strategically pursued retail partnerships to capitalize on the rising interest in health trackers during the pandemic. The company has also gained traction through high-profile adoptions from sports leagues like the NBA, highlighting its potential for early detection of health issues such as COVID-19 infections.

In-store Sizing Experience and Associated Benefits

Target end caps will feature a unique in-store sizing experience, complete with dummy units for potential customers to try on. Additionally, those who purchase a $10 sizing kit through Target's site will receive a $10 gift certificate, effectively offsetting the kit's cost.

Pricing and Revenue Model

While the Gen 3 rings start at $300, Oura's subscription service is the primary source of revenue. The company faced criticism when it announced that certain features would require a monthly fee. However, such backlash does not seem to have negatively impacted Oura's growth.

Growing Acceptance of the Fitness Ring Form Factor

The smart ring market gained further validation earlier this year when Samsung announced the launch of its own fitness ring, the Galaxy Ring, set to hit the market later in 2023. Oura's continued success and Samsung's entry into the market suggest a growing acceptance of the smart ring form factor among consumers and industry giants alike.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/cisa-chirp-systems-remotely-unlock-smart-locks/,US government says security flaw in Chirp Systems' app lets anyone remotely control smart home locks," Chirp Systems' App Allows Unauthorized Smart Lock Control, Warns CISA","[INTRODUCTION]
A significant security vulnerability has been discovered in a popular smart access control system used across thousands of U.S. rental homes. The flaw, which allows unauthorized individuals to remotely control any lock in an affected home, has been ignored by the manufacturer, Chirp Systems. This puts countless residents at risk of unauthorized entry and theft. This article will delve deeper into the issue, its implications, and the responsibility of stakeholders involved.

[THE VULNERABILITY]
The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a security advisory last week, warning of a vulnerability in Chirp-compatible smart locks. The agency stated that the phone apps developed by Chirp Systems ""improperly stores"" hardcoded credentials, which can be exploited to remotely control any Chirp-compatible smart lock. Hardcoding credentials is a security risk because anyone can extract and use those credentials to impersonate the app, leading to unauthorized actions, including opening or locking doors.

CISA classified the vulnerability as a 9.1 out of 10 in terms of severity due to its low attack complexity and the ease with which it can be exploited remotely. Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to gain unrestricted physical access to smart locks connected to a Chirp smart home system.

[UNRESPONSIVE MANUFACTURER]
Despite being notified by a security researcher in March 2021 and subsequent warnings from CISA, Chirp Systems has yet to address the vulnerability. This lack of action highlights the company's negligence in addressing critical security concerns, putting its customers at risk.

[IMPACT ON RENTERS AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES]
The growing prevalence of keyless access controls integrated with smart home technologies in the rental industry raises questions about responsibility and accountability when security issues arise. Rental giants, such as Camden Property Trust, have rolled out Chirp-connected smart locks to thousands of units.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/narwal-just-launched-a-new-midrange-robot-vacuum-with-flagship-features/,Narwal launches a new midrange robot vacuum with flagship features," Narwal Freo X Plus: A Powerful, Affordable Robot Vacuum & Mop with 7800Pa Suction & In-robot Dust Collection "," The New Narwal Freo X Plus: A Powerful and Efficient Robot Vacuum and Mop

Narwal, a renowned name in the robot vacuum industry, has recently launched an impressive mid-range device: the Narwal Freo X Plus. This innovative gadget combines the functionalities of a robot vacuum and a mop, boasting 7800Pa of suction power, an aerodynamically engineered tangle-free brush, and an extra-large dustbin capable of holding up to seven weeks' worth of dust and debris. The Narwal Freo X Plus is available for an affordable price of $400.

As stated by Narwal Robotics' founder and CEO, Junbin Zhang, ""With our revolutionary zero-tangle brush and strong suction power, the new Freo X Plus is the ultimate solution for pet hair problems and stubborn floor stains... Our ultra-quiet dust compression technology can store waste without odor for up to seven weeks within an antibacterial and allergy-resistant dust bag or bin.""

 An Ingenious Dust Collection System

One of the most notable features of the Narwal Freo X Plus is its in-robot dust collection system, making it one of the largest-capacity robot vacuums on the market. Instead of emptying its dust bin at the dock or requiring manual emptying after each cleaning, the robot compresses up to 1L of dust and debris in a self-contained bag within itself. This design allows users to employ the robot vacuum for up to seven weeks before changing the bag, according to Narwal.

The Narwal Freo X Plus' suction power of 7800Pa is comparable to more expensive devices like the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni and the Dreame X30 at a significantly lower cost. The tilted 50-degree brush, equipped with cone-shaped rubber strips and unequal sides, directs air and debris to one side, effectively preventing hair from tangling in the middle of the brush.

The technology industry is no stranger to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) rumors, and where there's smoke, there's often fire. However, this was not the case when the recent M&A rumor involving Salesforce and Informatica surfaced. According to reports, Salesforce was in talks to acquire Informatica for a sum ranging between the $6.5 billion MuleSoft deal in 2018 and the $15.7 billion Tableau acquisition in 2019.

However, the rumor was put to rest when Informatica released an official statement on Monday, asserting that it was not for sale. The company's press release read, ""Although Informaticaâ€™s policy is not to comment on market rumors or media speculation, the Company announced that it is not currently engaged in any discussions to be acquired."" This announcement came after The Wall Street Journal published a story on April 12, 2024, stating that Informatica was in advanced talks to be acquired.

Informatica's decision to publicly address the rumor is unusual, but the company felt compelled to set the record straight. Constellation's Ray Wang shared his insights on the matter with TechCrunch, saying, ""The potential acquisition of Informatica is quite curious as the client base and tech is not cutting-edge. Although it could potentially solve a data integration challenge that Salesforce has had, Data Cloud is already a strong offering, so I'm not sure if this deal makes sense.""

Salesforce, as is their standard practice, declined to comment on the rumors or speculation. Nevertheless, the rumor's fizzling out allows Informatica to focus on its core offerings, providing cutting-edge data integration solutions to its clients.

In conclusion, M&A rumors are commonplace in the technology industry, and while they may sometimes lead to significant acquisitions, they are not always accurate. Informatica's recent statement highlights the importance of setting the record straight and focusing on delivering value to its clients.

Introduction

How well can AI tools write code? This question has been at the forefront of my investigations as I've been testing large language models with various programming tasks. The goal is to determine if these tools can handle basic programming challenges. If they can, they might become valuable assistants to programmers, helping to save time. 

The Tests

I've developed four tests to gauge the coding capabilities of AI tools:

1. Writing a WordPress Plugin: This test evaluates basic web development skills using PHP within the WordPress framework, including user interface building.
2. Rewriting a String Function: This test assesses how well an AI tool can update a utility function for better functionality.
3. Finding an Annoying Bug: This test requires intimate knowledge of WordPress, as it involves identifying and fixing a tricky bug.
4. Writing a Script: This test challenges an AI tool to program using two specialized programming tools, testing its knowledge beyond the big languages.

This article will present the results of these tests for Meta's new Meta AI.

Test 1: Writing a WordPress Plugin

The Meta AI-generated interface was adequate, but it resulted in a white screen when tested, a common issue in WordPress known as ""The White Screen of Death."" ChatGPT, on the other hand, produced a cleaner interface with appropriate field headings and correct functionality.

Test 2: Rewriting a String Function

This test involved dollars and cents conversions. Meta AI had four main issues, including changing correct values, failing to handle numbers with multiple decimal points, rejecting correct numbers due to incorrect formatting, and failing with dollar amounts that had less than two decimals. Meta Code Llama succeeded in this test, but Meta AI did not.

Test 3: Finding an Annoying Bug

This test required identifying a tricky bug in pre-existing code. Meta AI passed this test, correctly identifying the error and suggesting a fix.

Test 4: Writing a Script

This test involved programming using two specialized tools. Meta AI was not tested for this task.

Conclusion

Meta AI showed promise in identifying bugs but struggled with basic programming tasks such as writing a WordPress plugin and rewriting a string function. It's clear",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/595059f9cf5e0082697391ab41988a18cce70dd7/2024/04/22/b7ac21cf-15e6-4af0-8833-383452d3668f/gettyimages-1490352690.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-22 00:00:00,"Discover how Meta AI performs in coding tasks!
