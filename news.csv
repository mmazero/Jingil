The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted governments worldwide to prioritize safety and ethical considerations. In a significant development, the UK and US governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create a joint approach for evaluating the safety of advanced AI models. This partnership between the UK's AI Safety Institute and its yet-to-be-named US counterpart, announced by Vice President Kamala Harris, marks the first bilateral arrangement on AI safety in the world.

The primary objective of this collaboration is to develop test suites that assess the risks and ensure the safety of cutting-edge AI models. Both parties will share technical knowledge, information, and personnel to perform joint testing exercises on publicly accessible models. The UK's science minister, Michelle Donelan, emphasized the urgency of this initiative, as a new generation of AI models is expected to emerge within the next year, potentially reshaping the landscape in unforeseen ways.

This partnership is a critical step towards understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with AI technologies. As AI continues to advance, it is essential to address concerns about national security and broader societal impacts. The collaboration between the UK and US Institutes will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of AI systems, enabling robust evaluations and the issuance of rigorous guidance.

In addition to this joint effort, governments have been developing regulations to govern AI tools and maintain the rights and safety of their citizens. In March, the White House signed an executive order ensuring that federal agencies use only AI tools that do not endanger the American people. Similarly, the European Parliament approved sweeping legislation to regulate artificial intelligence. This legislation bans AI that manipulates human behavior, exploits vulnerabilities, or employs biometric categorization based on sensitive characteristics. Moreover, it mandates the labeling of deepfakes and other AI-generated images, videos, and audio as such.

As AI technology advances, global collaboration and regulation will be crucial to ensure safety, ethical considerations, and transparency. The UK-US partnership, along with emerging regulations, demonstrates a shared commitment to addressing these challenges and fostering responsible AI development.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-team-reconfigurable-photonic-architecture-lifelong.html,Research team develops reconfigurable photonic computing architecture for lifelong learning, L2ONN: Reconfigurable Photonic Neural Network for Lifelong Learning ,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a ubiquitous part of our lives, and it has become increasingly complex and data-driven due to the availability of large-scale datasets. However, the current electronic deep neural models have limitations in terms of energy consumption, especially in edge systems. This has led to the development of next-generation computing modalities that can overcome physical constraints in electronics-based implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution for these limitations, as it can provide superior energy efficiency, processing speed, and computational throughput. Photonic computing leverages the unique properties of light, such as spatial sparsity and multi-spectrum parallelism, to enable lifelong learning and overcome the inherent limitations of electronics-based ANNs.

However, existing photonic neural networks (ONNs) suffer from ""catastrophic forgetting,"" which is the tendency to rapidly forget previously learned knowledge when training on a new task. This approach fails to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of sparsity and parallelism of wave optics in photonic computing, resulting in poor network capacity and scalability for multi-task learning.

Recently, a team of scientists led by Professor Lu Fang from Sigma Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and co-workers have developed L2ONN, a reconfigurable photonic computing architecture for lifelong learning. L2ONN leverages the unique characteristics of light, spatial sparsity, and multi-spectrum parallelism to endow ONNs with lifelong learning capability.

Experimental evaluations on free-space and on-chip architectures demonstrate that L2ONN shows remarkable learning capability on challenging tens-of-tasks, such as vision classification, voice recognition, and medical diagnosis. L2ONN achieves up to 14 times larger capacity than existing optical neural networks, with an order of magnitude higher energy efficiency than the representative electronic artificial neural networks.

The proposed photonic lifelong learning of L2ONN provides a turnkey solution for large-scale real-life AI applications with unprecedented scalability and versatility. This approach shows more advantages than electronic approaches in constructing a viable lifelong learning computing system.

According to the scientists, ""Humans possess the unique ability to incrementally absorb, learn, and memorize knowledge. The neurons and synapses perform work only when there are tasks to deal with, in which two important mechanisms participate: sparse neuron connectivity and parallelly task-driven neurocognition, together contribute to a lifelong memory consolidation and retrieval.""

These characteristic features can be naturally promoted from biological neurons to photonic neurons based on the intrinsic sparsity and parallelism properties of optical operators. An optical architecture imitating the structure and function of human brains demonstrates its potential to alleviate the aforementioned issues, which shows more advantages than electronic approaches in constructing a viable lifelong learning computing system.

In conclusion, the development of L2ONN represents a significant advancement in the field of photonic computing, as it enables photonic neural networks to exhibit lifelong learning capability. L2ONN has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence by providing a scalable and versatile solution for large-scale real-life applications.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/photonic-neuromorphic.jpg,2024-04-03 11:03:26,Photonic Computing Architecture for Lifelong Learning: An Innovative Solution for AI Applications, Photonic computing architecture ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction:

The Chinese rice grasshopper (Oxya chinensis) is a remarkable creature, particularly adept at water acrobatics. This ability, largely unexplored until now, has been the focus of a recent study by biologist, materials scientist, and bionics specialist Professor Stanislav N. Gorb and his team at Kiel University's Institute of Zoology. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offers valuable insights into the combined mechanisms that enable this species to perform such incredible feats on water. The findings could potentially revolutionize the field of robotics, paving the way for the development of bioinspired robots capable of moving on varied terrain.

The Spectacle of Water Acrobatics:

The Chinese rice grasshopper is a common sight in China's rice-growing regions, particularly along the Yangtze River. These creatures have an extraordinary ability to swim and jump out of the water, a skill that is not only fascinating to observe but also offers significant inspiration for advanced robotics.

The grasshopper's aquatic acrobatics are a result of a combination of static and dynamic forces. The researchers found that body weight support is achieved through hydrostatic pressure, which is proportional to the mass of the grasshoppers. The motion drives, on the other hand, are derived from controlled interactions between the limbs and water, a phenomenon known as hydrodynamics.

A New Drive Strategy for Robotics:

Previous studies have primarily focused on two types of locomotion on the surface of the water: locomotion supported by surface tension and locomotion dominated by the special dynamics of the limbs. However, these strategies are not ideal for bioinspired technical applications. The former requires superhydrophobic (not wettable) surfaces, which are challenging to achieve for large robots. The latter, meanwhile, is based on frequent striking of the surface, which consumes a significant amount of energy.

The Chinese rice grasshopper, however, uses a different drive principle. It combines two different mechanisms to facilitate its water acrobatics: supporting its weight through static hydro forces and moving its body forward through hydrodynamics. This unique approach could potentially lead",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/new-robot-swims-and-ju.jpg,2024-04-02 10:39:35,Discover the secrets of the Chinese rice grasshopper's aquatic acrobatics!

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scientists-amorphous-flexible-mini-inductor.html,Scientists develop novel amorphous flexible mini-inductor, Amorphous Flexible Mini-Inductor: Revolutionizing Flexible Electronics Technology ,"Welcome to the world of flexible mini-inductors! These tiny components play a crucial role in power conversion and signal processing, and they're becoming increasingly important as we miniaturize our electronic devices. But conventional coils, which are typically made from non-magnetic materials, are limited in their flexibility and inductive capabilities. That's where a new study by a team of Chinese researchers comes in.

Prof. Wang Junqiang and his team at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) have developed an amorphous flexible mini-inductor that's both flexible and highly inductive. By using soft magnetic amorphous alloys as coil materials, the researchers were able to achieve both excellent flexibility and high inductance density.

But what sets this mini-inductor apart from conventional coils is its ability to reduce magnetic leakage to less than 10-4 T, which greatly minimizes interference between electronic components. This is thanks to the researchers' use of high-precision femtosecond laser ablation technology to precisely craft amorphous alloy ribbons without inducing any crystallization.

And the benefits of this design don't stop there. The amorphous structure of the mini-inductor gives it excellent mechanical flexibility, allowing it to be stretched by up to 300% of its original size. After 2,500 bending cycles at a 16-mm bending radius, the device maintained its performance with only a slight decay in inductance value and quality factor.

But perhaps the most impressive thing about this mini-inductor is its ability to adapt to various bending and folding application environments. With a flexible design and ultra-high inductive density in a very small volume, this mini-inductor is perfect for miniaturizing thin and light electronic products.

So what does this mean for the future of flexible electronics technology? This study not only provides a new application scenario for amorphous soft magnetic alloys, but it also sheds light on the material selection and device design of flexible electronics technology. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with electronics, devices like this amorphous flexible mini-inductor will be critical in enabling us to create smaller, more powerful, and more versatile electronic products.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a third investigation into Fisker's Ocean SUV, this time focusing on issues with the doors opening.

The NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has identified 14 complaints from owners who have been unable to open the doors of their Fisker Oceans, either from the inside or the outside. The complaints point to an ""intermittent failure"" of the door latch and handle system, and suggest that the emergency override mechanism may also not work.

Fisker customers have reported being stuck inside or outside their cars for months, according to internal documents obtained exclusively by TechCrunch in February. However, the new safety probe suggests a deeper problem with the SUV's doors. The investigation is designated as a ""preliminary evaluation,"" which ODI usually resolves within eight months.

The Ocean SUV is already being investigated by ODI for issues with its braking system and for complaints about the vehicle rolling away on uneven surfaces. Fisker has not issued any recalls for the Ocean. Fisker told TechCrunch that it is ""fully cooperating with NHTSA on this matter.""

The third investigation comes as Fisker is facing significant challenges. It paused production of the Ocean in March and has only $121 million in the bank. Fisker is struggling to sell the thousands of Ocean SUVs it has in inventory, either directly or through its nascent dealership model. The company recently slashed prices by up to 39% in a desperate attempt to generate sales. Fisker was recently delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. A potential partnership with Nissan fell through, putting Fisker's rescue funding at risk.

This story has been updated to include a comment from Fisker.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill's Chemistry Department have developed a method to harvest and convert solar energy into high-energy compounds. This innovation could potentially produce environmentally friendly fuels, mitigating the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions.

The research, published in ACS Energy Letters, focuses on a process called methyl termination. This technique modifies the surface of silicon, an essential component in solar cells, with a simple organic compound consisting of one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The modification enhances silicon's performance in converting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using sunlight.

This work is inspired by artificial photosynthesis, a process that mimics how plants convert carbon dioxide into energy-rich molecules using sunlight. The researchers aim to store solar power in the form of liquid fuels that can be used later, addressing one of the challenges of solar energy—its intermittent availability.

Carbon dioxide, a significant greenhouse gas contributing to climate change, can be converted into carbon monoxide. Although carbon monoxide is also a greenhouse gas, it is less harmful and serves as a building block for more complex fuels. The UNC-Chapel Hill team used a ruthenium molecular catalyst with a chemically modified silicon photoelectrode. This combination facilitated the efficient conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide using light energy without generating unwanted byproducts.

The system using the modified silicon photoelectrodes demonstrated an impressive 87% efficiency in producing carbon monoxide. This efficiency is comparable or better than systems using traditional metal electrodes, such as gold or platinum. Furthermore, the silicon photoelectrode required 460 millivolts less electrical energy to initiate a reaction than a purely electrically driven process. This energy saving is significant because the process utilizes direct light harvesting to supplement or offset the energy required for the chemical reaction.

The researchers also addressed a common issue with silicon surfaces, which typically produce hydrogen gas instead of carbon monoxide.

In today's rapidly changing work environment, the traditional sources of career advice are being challenged by a new generation of workers. Gone are the days when career counselors, managers, or experienced colleagues were the sole purveyors of guidance for young professionals. Enter Generation Z, a cohort of workers who are quickly redefining the landscape of career advice.

A Distinct Generation with Unique Needs

Generation Z, currently comprising about two billion people worldwide, will account for 27% of the global workforce by 2023. This generation has its own set of priorities and values, which significantly differ from their older counterparts. For instance, a staggering 49% of Gen Z workers consider their job central to their sense of identity. Moreover, work-life balance, remote working, and flexible leave policies are of utmost importance to them.

Gen Z workers are also more likely to leave jobs that do not meet their needs. According to a U.S. survey, this generation could change jobs up to 10 times between the ages of 18 and 34. Besides, Gen Z is a values-led generation, with 55% researching a company's environmental impact and policies before accepting a job offer, and another 17% changing jobs or sectors due to climate concerns.

The Shortcomings of Traditional Career Advice

The shift in priorities and values among Gen Z workers has led to a growing disillusionment with traditional career advice. A study conducted by Workplace Intelligence and INTOO found that 63% of Gen Z workers feel that their employers prioritize productivity over career development, and 75% have received bad career advice, often from their own managers.

With a lack of support and guidance from their employers, Gen Z workers are increasingly turning to alternative sources for career advice. In fact, 47% of Gen Z workers say they receive better advice from Open AI's generative AI platform, ChatGPT, than from their managers.

While ChatGPT can be helpful in providing guidance for tasks such as personalizing resumes for job applications, its data may be outdated or not entirely relevant to Gen Z workers' concerns. Additionally, it cannot provide personalized or specific advice tailored to individual circumstances.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-machine-enables-viability-vertical-axis.html,Machine learning enables viability of vertical-axis wind turbines, Optimizing Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines with Machine Learning & Sensor Tech ,"Title: Harnessing the Power of Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines: A New Approach

Introduction

Imagine a wind turbine, and you're likely picturing the classic windmill design, known as a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). However, the first wind turbines, which originated in the Middle East during the 8th century for grinding grain, were vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT). These turbines rotate perpendicular to the wind, as opposed to parallel. VAWTs have several advantages over HAWTs, including reduced noise, greater wind energy density, and less impact on wildlife. Yet, they are conspicuously absent from today's wind energy market. The reason lies in an engineering problem related to air flow control, which a team of researchers led by Sébastien Le Fouest and Karen Mulleners from the School of Engineering Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Lab (UNFOLD) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) aims to solve using sensor technology and machine learning.

The Challenges and Opportunities of VAWTs

While Europe's installed wind energy capacity is growing by 19 gigawatts per year, this figure needs to reach 30 GW to meet the UN's 2050 objectives for carbon emissions. However, the growth is hindered not by financial barriers, but by social and legislative challenges, primarily due to the size and noisiness of wind turbines.

VAWTs, despite their advantages, have a critical drawback: they only function well with moderate, continuous air flow. The vertical axis of rotation means that the blades are constantly changing orientation with respect to the wind, leading to the formation of vortices in a phenomenon called dynamic stall. These vortices create transient structural loads that the blades cannot withstand.

The Solution: Optimal Blade Pitch Control

To address this issue, Le Fouest and his team mounted sensors onto an actuating blade shaft to measure the air forces acting on it. By pitching the blade back and forth at different angles, speeds, and amplitudes, they generated series of ""pitch profiles."" They then used a computer to run a genetic algorithm, which performed over 3,500 experimental iterations, selecting the most efficient and robust",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/machine-learning-enabl-1.jpg,2024-04-03 10:09:10,"Optimize vertical-axis wind turbines with AI-powered blade pitch control: Increase efficiency, reduce costs, and expand urban applications.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-magnetic-fields-boosts-electrocatalysis-sustainable.html,Study shows magnetic fields boosts electrocatalysis for sustainable fuel production,Optimized SEO title: Harnessing Magnetic Forces to Boost Electrocatalysis: A Giant Leap Towards Sustainable Energy,"Title: Harnessing Magnetic Forces to Boost Electrocatalysis: A Giant Leap Towards Sustainable Energy

In the race to transition to cleaner energy sources, scientists worldwide are relentlessly seeking innovative methods to optimize fuel production processes. One such critical process is electrocatalysis, which plays a pivotal role in converting chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Electrocatalysis involves the use of catalysts to accelerate electrochemical reactions without being consumed, making it an essential component of devices like fuel cells and electrolyzers. These devices facilitate the efficient transformation of fuels, such as hydrogen and oxygen into electricity or water into hydrogen and oxygen, respectively.

However, existing electrocatalysis methods often face efficiency challenges due to the suboptimal transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface, which is a crucial step in energy conversion. To tackle this issue, researchers have been exploring novel approaches, and a recent study published in Nature Communications by scientists led by Magalí Lingenfelder at EPFL has caught the attention of the scientific community.

The researchers focused on the promising convergence of magnetic fields and electrocatalysis, revealing a potential pathway to more efficient and eco-friendly fuel production technologies. By surrounding the catalysts with magnetic fields, the team created Lorentz forces, which in turn induced whirling motions that improved reactant and product movement at the catalyst surface. This enhancement led to a more consistent and rapid reaction, overcoming the limitations imposed by reactant scarcity, a common challenge in reactions like the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), critical for fuel cells.

To conduct this research, the team developed a tool for observing ion movement in real-time under a magnetic field using an advanced magneto-electrochemical setup. By applying magnetic fields to non-magnetic electrodes and monitoring reactions, the scientists decoupled the different effects and observed how magnetic forces could stir and enhance reactant movement around the catalyst, significantly improving the efficiency of reactions vital for green hydrogen production.

As AI technology continues to advance, we've seen remarkable capabilities in image creation. In this article, we'll explore one of the most exciting features that has emerged in the AI image creation world: inpainting.

Inpainting, also known as ""variation"" in some AI tools, is a technique that allows users to make selective changes to an image that have been generated by AI. It is a powerful tool that allows users to create unique pieces of art that are tailored to their preferences.

One of the most popular AI image creation tools that now includes inpainting is Midjourney. In this article, we'll show you how to use inpainting to create custom art pieces using Midjourney.

Choosing the right image

Before we begin, it's important to choose the right image to work with. We'll be using a starter image that we'll generate using a text prompt. For this example, we'll be creating a custom version of the classic painting ""Nighthawks"" by Edward Hopper.

To generate the starter image, we'll use a text prompt that describes the style of the image we want to create, but not the actual painting itself. This will allow Midjourney to generate a unique take on the image.

Here's an example text prompt that you can use:

Exterior view of a downtown diner late at night, with a few people inside. Mood of isolation and urban solitude. The diner's large glass windows illuminate a dark, deserted street, enhancing the sense of quiet and introspection. Done in the style of Edward Hopper.

Once you've entered your text prompt, Midjourney will generate a set of four images that you can choose from. For this example, we'll be using the first image.

Adding the Easter Bunny

Now that we have our starter image, it's time to add our creative touch. We'll be using inpainting to add a giant Easter Bunny to the image.

To do this, we'll click on the ""Vary (Region)"" button in the Midjourney interface. This will bring up an editing window where we can make our modifications.

In the editing window, we'll need to draw a rectangle or freehand selection around the area where we want to make our modification. This will be the area where the Easter Bunny will be added.

Next, we'll need to enter a prompt for what we want generated. For this example, we'll be entering ""giant Easter Bunny"" to generate a bunny that matches the style of the rest of the image.

Once we've entered our prompt, Midjourney will generate four bunny images that we can choose from. We'll select the fourth image, which is the only one that is looking into the diner.

Smartphone myopia

Now that we've added the Easter Bunny, it's time to add a smartphone to the image. We'll be using inpainting again to create a realistic smartphone that blends seamlessly into the rest of the image.

To do this, we'll click on the ""Vary (Region)"" button again, this time selecting an area next to the bunny. We'll enter our prompt, which in this case is ""smartphone.""

Midjourney will generate four smartphone images that we can choose from. We'll select the one that best fits the style of the rest of the image.

Final thoughts

Inpainting is a powerful tool that allows users to create unique pieces of art that are tailored to their preferences. With Midjourney, we've been able to add a giant Easter Bunny and a smartphone to our starter image, creating a custom piece of art that is both visually appealing and thought-provoking.

As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more exciting capabilities in image creation. Inpainting is just the beginning. Who knows what other amazing features we'll see in the future?

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/microsoft-and-quantinuum-say-theyve-ushered-in-the-next-era-of-quantum-computing/,Microsoft and Quantinuum say they've ushered in the next era of quantum computing, Microsoft and Quantinuum's breakthrough in quantum error correction: ,"Microsoft and Quantinuum have achieved a major breakthrough in quantum error correction, using Quantinuum’s ion-trap hardware and Microsoft’s new qubit-virtualization system to run more than 14,000 experiments without a single error. This new system also allowed the team to check the logical qubits and correct any errors it encountered without destroying the logical qubits. This has now moved the state-of-the-art of quantum computing out of what has typically been dubbed the era of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.

The team used Quantinuum’s H2 trapped-ion processor and was able to combine 30 physical qubits into four highly reliable logical qubits. Encoding multiple physical qubits into a single logical qubit helps protect the system from errors. The physical qubits are entangled together so that it becomes possible to detect an error in a physical qubit and fix it.

The most important result of this breakthrough is the team’s ability to perform “active syndrome extraction,” that is, the ability to diagnose an error and correct it, without destroying the logical qubit in the process. This critical component of reliable quantum computing has been demonstrated with the qubit-virtualization system, resulting in a low logical error rate over multiple rounds of syndrome extraction.

This achievement marks the first step in being able to correct errors while not destroying the logical qubits and showcases a fundamental milestone in quantum error correction. It is a step in the right direction for quantum computing. The industry still needs to replicate these results and implement similar error correction systems, but theoretically, a computer with 100 of these logical qubits could already be useful for solving some problems, while a machine with 1,000 qubits could, Microsoft says, “unlock commercial advantage.”

Combining several different techniques, the team was able to run thousands of experiments with virtually no errors. It involved quite a bit of preparation and pre-selecting systems that already looked to be in good shape for a successful run, but still, that’s a massive improvement from where the industry was just a short while ago.

The field of quantum computing has long been plagued by the problem of decoherence, where even the smallest changes in the environment can lead a quantum system to essentially become random. This has limited the number of qubits that can be used in quantum computers to just over a thousand at best. A qubit is the fundamental unit of computing in quantum systems, analogous to a bit in a classic computer, but each qubit can be in multiple states at the same time and doesn’t fall into a specific position until measured, which underlies the potential of quantum to deliver a huge leap in computing power.

No matter how many qubits you have, though, if you barely have time to run a basic algorithm before the system becomes too noisy to get a useful result, then the industry is still in the era of NISQ computers.

The new hardware/software system demonstrated by Microsoft and Quantinuum improves on using only physical qubits by up to 800x. The researchers note that to move beyond NISQ, a large separation between logical and physical qubit error rates is necessary, as well as the ability to correct individual circuit errors and to generate entanglement between at least two logical qubits. If these results hold up, then the team achieved all three and we have indeed entered a stable era of resilient quantum computing.

This breakthrough is a significant milestone in the field of quantum computing and shows that the industry is making progress towards building practical quantum computers. It is a step towards a new era of computing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we process information and solve complex problems.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/quantum_microsoft.jpg?w=1047,2024-04-03 13:00:22,"Meta Description: Microsoft and Quantinuum have achieved a major breakthrough in quantum error correction using ion-trap hardware and Microsoft's new qubit-virtualization system to run over 14,000 experiments without errors.

Skepticism is a quality that is often taken for granted in the world of tech journalism. However, a new documentary series is trying to shed light on the transformative potential of technology and startups, and the ways in which they can improve and secure the future. ""A Brief History of the Future,"" hosted by Ari Wallach, takes a critical but not cynical approach to the future of technology, and its impact on our lives.

The thesis of the show is that we must not discount the importance of the promise of technology, while acknowledging its potential dangers and pitfalls. Wallach, who describes himself as a futurist, believes that there is a real need to focus on what people are doing to solve the problems created by technology, rather than just criticizing them.

In the six-episode series, Wallach talks with dozens of individuals, companies, and communities about their visions of the future and the steps they are taking to make it a reality. From innovative materials like mushroom leather to ocean cleanup projects to end-of-life care, Wallach finds examples of people who are working to improve the future, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

The show takes a unique approach to the future, exploring not just the predictions of Silicon Valley publicists or tech dystopian warnings, but the real-world solutions that people are developing to create a better tomorrow. Wallach believes that it is important to expose people to these visions of the future, and to help them imagine new possibilities for their own lives.

""The theory of the case is that when you ask 10 Americans 'what do you think about the future?', nine out of 10 are gonna say, I'm afraid of it, or they're going say it's all about technology,"" explains Wallach. ""But there are so many examples of people working on solutions that it's possible to see the future in a different way.""

One of the main challenges of the show was figuring out how to present these visions of the future in a way that was both compelling and accessible to a general audience. Wallach and his team focused on finding stories that were both inspiring and relatable, and that showcased the work of people who were making a real difference in the world.

""We wanted to bring the future into people's living rooms that don't normally think about it in a critical, open-minded way, in terms of the futures that you create,"" says Wallach. ""People just don't get exposed to it. Because at the current moment, there are a whole host of reasons that, culturally, to be critical and cynical is to come across as smart and aware. But now we're at a point that if we continually do that, we're going to lose the thread. We're going to lose the narrative of the entire larger human project.""

Overall, ""A Brief History of the Future"" is a fascinating look at the many ways in which technology and innovation are shaping our world, and the possibilities for a brighter, more sustainable future. Whether you are a tech enthusiast or simply someone who is curious about the future, this show is sure to inspire and inform.

It is well under the 50-character limit.","Title: Revolutionary Quantum-Optimized Window Coating: A Game-Changer in Energy Efficiency

Imagine a world where windows not only illuminate our spaces but also actively help reduce energy costs and combat global warming. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame have made significant strides in this direction by developing an innovative window coating that blocks heat-generating ultraviolet and infrared light while allowing visible light to pass through, regardless of the sun's angle. This groundbreaking discovery has the potential to cut air-conditioning cooling costs by more than one-third in hot climates.

Traditional window coatings are often designed to optimize light filtration at a 90-degree angle, which is less effective when the sun's rays enter windows at oblique angles during peak hours. To tackle this issue, the Notre Dame research team, led by Tengfei Luo, created a transparent window coating using ultra-thin layers of silica, alumina, and titanium oxide on a glass base. A micrometer-thick silicon polymer was added to enhance the structure's cooling power by reflecting thermal radiation through the atmospheric window and into outer space.

However, the challenge lay in rearranging the layers to accommodate multiple angles of solar light. A trial-and-error approach was impractical due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this hurdle, the team turned to quantum computing and more specifically, quantum annealing, to create an optimal configuration that maximized visible light transmission while minimizing heat-producing wavelengths.

Their quantum-optimized coating maintained transparency and reduced temperature by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees Celsius (about 9.7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in a model room, even when light was transmitted at various angles. This revolutionary coating functions similarly to polarized sunglasses, reducing light intensity without compromising clarity.

The active learning and quantum computing scheme used to design this coating can be applied to create a wide range of materials with complex properties. This breakthrough paves the way for more energy-efficient buildings, automobiles, and other applications, ultimately contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.

England's National Health Service (NHS) has announced that tens of thousands of children and adults with type 1 diabetes will receive an ""artificial pancreas"" to help manage their insulin levels. This hybrid closed loop system, a sensor implanted beneath the skin that sends wireless readings to an externally worn pump, can help patients avoid the risks of type 1 diabetes without worrying about finger sticks or injections.

The NHS hasn't said which specific device(s) its program will use, but what's different here is the nation's publicly funded health care system providing them for free rather than as an exclusive privilege for the well-to-do. Although the NHS hasn't stated which device(s) it will use, it's worth noting that Tandem, a US-based company, received FDA authorization for a similar device in 2019.

The hybrid closed loop system works by continuously monitoring glucose levels at regular intervals with a sensor implanted beneath the skin. The sensor sends that data wirelessly to a pump, worn externally, which delivers the appropriate insulin dosage. The ""hybrid"" part of its name comes from the fact that some user input, including entering carb intake, is still required in the otherwise self-regulating system.

The NHS has identified 269,095 people in England living with type 1 diabetes, highlighting how many folks could potentially benefit from the rollout. The program will begin identifying patients for the program starting on Tuesday.

""Diabetes is a tough and relentless condition, but these systems make a significant, life-changing difference — improving both the overall health and quality of life for people with diabetes,"" Colette Marshall, chief executive of Diabetes UK, wrote in the NHS's press release announcing the rollout. ""This really is a landmark moment and we'll be working with the NHS and others to ensure a fair rollout that reaches people as quickly as possible.""

Recent research aims to enhance the efficiency of energy harvesting using a new type of metasurface that can be reconfigured, resembling the assembly of LEGO bricks.

A collaborative team of researchers from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) has developed a multifunctional elastic metasurface that can be freely configured by attaching and detaching components for practical applications. Their work, published in Advanced Science, promises to revolutionize energy harvesting.

Metamaterials, artificially designed structures that manipulate wave energy, offer a solution to energy harvesting by gathering elastic waves in piezoelectric components, increasing the efficiency of electricity production. However, limitations in theoretical analysis of the beams constituting metamaterials restrict their operation to a single frequency and limit their practical applications in real structures.

To overcome these limitations, the researchers employed the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory instead of the conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The former considers the fundamental characteristics of elasticity, including shear deformation and rotational inertia effects of the beam. This study marks the first application of this theory to elastic metamaterial research.

The researchers successfully interpreted and modeled elastic metamaterials for phase modulation of elastic waves using the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory. They also fabricated a new type of Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam-based reconfigurable elastic metasurface (TREM) capable of attaching and detaching multiple structures. The TREM can reconstruct its surface depending on its application, enabling control over various wave phenomena such as anomalous wave refraction, wave focusing, self-accelerated wave propagation, and total wave reflection across a wide frequency range.

The TREM demonstrated outstanding effectiveness in harvesting elastic wave energy, enhancing the electrical output power of piezoelectric components by up to eight times. This highlights its value as a piezoelectric energy harvesting system.

The researchers, led by Professor Junsuk Rho from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering at POSTECH, and Ph.D./MS student Geon Lee from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at POSTECH, collaborated with Professor Miso Kim from the School of Advanced Materials Science and Engineering at SKKU to develop this technology.

Professor Rho said, ""I believe that our newly developed metasurface, designed to operate across multifunctional and wide-frequency ranges, will prove invaluable in energy harvesting, most notably in the eco-friendly utilization of ambient energy. This technology, along with its applications in structural health monitoring, wireless sensing, and the Internet of Things, holds great potential for significant contributions across diverse fields.""

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-may-have-finally-made-quantum-computing-useful-164501302.html,Microsoft may have finally made quantum computing useful, Microsoft Achieves Record-Low Error Rate in Quantum Computing ,"Quantum computing has long been an exciting prospect, but despite some impressive hardware announcements, we haven't seen many practical applications of this technology yet. Today, Microsoft and Quantinuum have announced that they've developed the most error-free quantum computing system yet.
While classical computers and electronics use binary bits as their basic unit of information (either on or off), quantum computers work with qubits, which can exist in a superposition of two states at the same time. The problem with qubits is that they're prone to error, which is why today's quantum computers (known as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum [NISQ] computers) are only used for research and experimentation.
Microsoft's solution was to group physical qubits into virtual qubits, which allowed them to apply error diagnostics and correction without destroying them. They then ran this all over Quantinuum's hardware. The result was an error rate that was 800 times better than relying on physical qubits alone. Microsoft claims they were able to run more than 14,000 experiments without any errors.
This achievement could finally bring us to ""Level 2 Resilient"" quantum computing, which would be reliable enough for practical applications. According to Jason Zander, EVP of Microsoft's Strategic Missions and Technologies division, the task at hand for the entire quantum ecosystem is to increase the fidelity of qubits and enable fault-tolerant quantum computing so that we can use a quantum machine to unlock solutions to previously intractable problems.
""In short, we need to transition to reliable logical qubits — created by combining multiple physical qubits together into logical ones to protect against noise and sustain a long (i.e., resilient) computation,"" Zander wrote. ""By having high-quality hardware components and breakthrough error-handling capabilities designed for that machine, we can get better results than any individual component could give us.""
Researchers will be able to get a taste of Microsoft's reliable quantum computing via Azure Quantum Elements in the next few months, where it will be available as a private preview. The goal is to push even further to Level 3 quantum supercomputing, which will theoretically be able to tackle incredibly complex issues like climate change and exotic drug research. It's unclear how long it'll take to actually reach that point, but for now, at least we're moving one step closer towards practical quantum computing.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jrXMv5qLg.309TP8Q1Fq8g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/b0685660-f1d5-11ee-bcbf-23137a24dced,2024-04-03 16:45:01,"Microsoft and Quantinuum have developed the most error-free quantum computing system yet, significantly improving the fidelity of qubits and bringing us closer to practical applications.

Introduction

The quest for safer and more efficient energy storage solutions has led scientists to explore the potential of solid-state lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. These batteries, which utilize solid electrolytes instead of the traditional liquid ones, offer several advantages over their conventional counterparts, including higher energy density, increased transference numbers, and non-flammability. However, solid electrolytes often face challenges related to lower Li-ion conductivity and poor electrode-solid electrolyte contact. To address these issues, a team of researchers has recently discovered a stable and highly conductive Li-ion conductor in the form of a pyrochlore-type oxyfluoride.

The Groundbreaking Discovery

In a study published in Chemistry of Materials, a research team led by Professor Kenjiro Fujimoto, Professor Akihisa Aimi from Tokyo University of Science, and Dr. Shuhei Yoshida from Denso Corporation unveiled their discovery of a highly conductive Li-ion conductor. This new material, a pyrochlore-type oxyfluoride, has the potential to revolutionize the field of solid-state batteries.

The pyrochlore-type oxyfluoride, denoted as Li 2-x La (1+x)/3 M 2 O 6 F (M = Nb, Ta), underwent comprehensive structural and compositional analysis using various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, Rietveld analysis, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and selected-area electron diffraction. The researchers developed Li 1.25 La 0.58 Nb 2 O 6 F, which demonstrated a bulk ionic conductivity of 7.0 mS cm⁻¹ and a total ionic conductivity of 3.9 mS cm⁻¹ at room temperature, surpassing the lithium-ion conductivity of known oxide solid electrolytes.

Key Advantages and Applications

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from ESMT Berlin have explored the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage human participants in large-scale research projects. The study, published in Research Policy, highlights how AI can take on managerial functions, such as task allocation, coordination, and motivation, thereby revolutionizing the way research projects are conducted.

The research, conducted by Maximilian Koehler and Henry Sauermann, focuses on AI's role as a manager of human workers, rather than a direct performer of research tasks. This shift in perspective, known as Algorithmic Management (AM), could enable research projects to function on a larger scale with increased efficiency.

The rapid complexity and expansion of scientific research call for advanced management strategies. The study demonstrates that AI can not only replicate but also potentially surpass human managers by leveraging its instantaneous, comprehensive, and interactive capabilities.

Investigating algorithmic management in crowd and citizen science, Koehler and Sauermann provide examples of AI effectively performing five crucial managerial functions: task division and allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and supporting learning. Through online documents, interviews with organizers, AI developers, and project participants, and firsthand participation in some projects, the researchers identified projects using algorithmic management and analyzed their effectiveness.

The growing number of use cases suggests that AI adoption could significantly improve research productivity. As Koehler states, ""AI can now enhance the scope and efficiency of scientific research by managing complex, large-scale projects.""

Quantitative comparisons reveal that AM-enabled projects are generally larger and associated with platforms offering shared AI tools. This trend implies that AM may enable projects to scale but also requires technical infrastructures that may challenge stand-alone projects.

These findings indicate changing sources of competitive advantage in research and carry implications for research funders, digital research platforms, and larger research organizations such as universities or corporate R&D labs.

While AI can manage various functions, human leaders will not become obsolete. Instead, they can focus on more strategic and social tasks such as identifying high-value research targets, securing funding, or building an effective organizational culture. AI, in this context, empowers human managers to perform at their best, driving innovation and progress in scientific research.

The upgrade to Copilot comes after Microsoft's ally OpenAI made its GPT-3.5 model freely available for unlimited usage to users without a sign-in. This has likely pressured Microsoft and other AI providers and rivals to upgrade paid offerings such as Copilot to justify their cost. The move also follows Microsoft's earlier decision to open its custom Copilot GPT Builder to all Copilot Pro subscribers, further expanding the capabilities and offerings of its AI assistant.

Copilot in 365 will now automatically begin sessions with GPT-4 Turbo as its default AI model on the backend, provided by Microsoft's investment and partner OpenAI. GPT-4 Turbo offers a massively larger ""context window"" for the user to enter in longer prompts, which means that users of GPT-4 and Copilot can enter in much larger chunks of text or information into their prompts and have the AI respond, analyze, and edit or work with them. Copilot 365 users will also now get to enjoy unlimited messaging and unlimited chats per conversation with the Copilot assistant.

Microsoft's blog post also stated that Copilot comes with ""commercial data protection,"" which ensures that web traffic sent from 365 users outside of their companies is anonymized and encrypted. This means that users can trust Copilot with their sensitive company data, as Microsoft claims that the Copilot assistant can help them quickly scan their email for important messages, pull information from across their work, and ideate on the best path forward.

The move is an important one for Microsoft as it seeks to reassure customers that their data is safe when using its AI tools. This has become a major concern for Microsoft in recent years with governments around the world, as the U.S. House of Representatives was recently reported to have banned the Copilot assistant entirely due to concerns about leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services. Microsoft has stated that Copilot will ""meet federal government security and compliance requirements that we intend to deliver later this year.""

In the European Union, Microsoft offers Office 365 with or without its reviled Teams messaging app bundled in, in order to comply with EU antitrust regulations. Microsoft has also announced that Copilot for Government Community Cloud (GCC) will roll out in the summer of 2024. Microsoft hopes to court enterprises customers wary of the ongoing copyright lawsuits engulfing generative AI companies.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-simple-harvest-blue-energy.html,Researchers find a simple way to harvest more 'blue energy' from waves," ""Harvest More Blue Energy from Waves with New Liquid-Solid TENG Design"" ","The Power of Waves: How to Harness the Energy of the Ocean

Waves are a powerful force, capable of generating an astonishing amount of energy. Now, thanks to a groundbreaking innovation, we have a new way to harness this energy and convert it into electricity.

Researchers at the American Chemical Society (ACS) have developed a liquid–solid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that is capable of capturing more energy from ocean waves. This device is a major advancement in the field of blue energy harvesting, which is the process of extracting energy from the ocean's waves.

TENGs are devices that convert mechanical energy into electricity, making them a promising technology for harvesting energy from waves. However, their low energy output has limited their practicality for large-scale applications.

To address this issue, the researchers at the ACS repositioned the energy-collecting electrode of a TENG from the center of the device to the end where the water crashes with the most force. This simple modification dramatically increased the amount of energy that could be harvested.

In their experiments, the researchers used 16-inch clear plastic tubes to create two TENGs. Inside the first device, they placed a copper foil electrode at the center of the tube, which is the conventional location in liquid–solid TENGs.

For the new design, they inserted a copper foil electrode at one end of the tube. The researchers then filled the tubes with water and connected the electrodes to an external circuit.

As the rocker moved water back and forth within the tubes, it generated electrical currents by converting mechanical energy into electricity. The researchers found that the optimized design increased the device's conversion of mechanical energy to electrical current by 2.4 times compared to the conventional design.

In another experiment, the optimized TENG blinked an array of 35 LEDs on and off as water entered the section of the tube covered by the electrode and then flowed away, respectively.

The researchers say these demonstrations lay the foundation for larger-scale blue energy harvesting from ocean waves and show the potential of their device for other applications such as wireless underwater signaling communications.

Overall, this innovation represents a major step forward in the field of blue energy harvesting and has the potential to revolutionize our approach to energy production. As we continue to explore new ways to harness the power of the ocean, we will undoubtedly discover even more innovative solutions that will help us create a more sustainable and resilient future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-simple-way-to-harves.jpg,2024-04-03 08:00:02,Discover the Power of Ocean Waves with the New TENG Blue Energy Harvester!

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly infiltrated various sectors, offering limitless opportunities for innovation. From revolutionizing travel to enhancing search engine capabilities, AI is changing the way we live our lives. However, this technological boom may have dire consequences for the music industry. In response, more than 200 artists, including music legends from multiple genres, have united to address the massive dangers AI poses to the world of music.

An open letter, spearheaded by the Artist Rights Alliance, advocates for musicians and their rights in the face of AI advancements. The letter, signed by music heavyweights like Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, the estates of Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra, Billie Eilish, Jon Bon Jovi, and Smokey Robinson, was initially published by Variety. The signees express their concerns about the unauthorized use of artist voices to train AI systems and the potential erosion of human creativity.

The letter reads, ""We, the undersigned members of the artist and songwriting communities, call on AI developers, technology companies, platforms, and digital music services to cease the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists."" The artists acknowledge the potential of AI to foster creativity, but they also highlight the risks of AI undermining artists, songwriters, musicians, and rightsholders, thereby threatening their livelihoods.

The unauthorized use of artist voices for AI training has raised ethical questions. Major companies are using artist voices without permission, which fuels concerns about replacing human artists with AI-generated counterparts. The letter emphasizes that unchecked AI development could lead to a race to the bottom, devaluing artists' work and preventing fair compensation.

The signatories call on companies, platforms, and digital music services to pledge not to develop or deploy AI-generated music technology, tools, or content. The issue of AI in entertainment has become increasingly contentious, with Congressional hearings in 2024, a Tennessee law meant to protect artists, and Hollywood screenwriters going on strike over AI-generated content.
