Introduction:
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, and with the increase in the availability of large-scale datasets, the demand for AI-powered solutions has grown exponentially. However, the current AI models are limited by their energy consumption and computational limitations. The need for next-generation computing modalities has led to the development of photonic computing, which promises better energy efficiency, processing speed, and computational throughput.

Body:
Photonic computing is a promising avenue for AI applications that requires the development of reconfigurable photonic computing architectures for lifelong learning. Existing photonic neural networks (ONNs) suffer from ""catastrophic forgetting"" and struggle with simple onefold tasks due to the limitations of conventional computing systems. These limitations prevent ONNs from fully exploiting the intrinsic properties of sparsity and parallelism in photonic computing.

The team of scientists, led by Professor Lu Fang from Sigma Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, co-workers have developed L2ONN, a reconfigurable photonic computing architecture for lifelong learning. The unique characteristics of light, spatial sparsity, and multi-spectrum parallelism have been developed in photonic computing architecture for the first time, endowing ONNs with lifelong learning capability. Unlike existing ONNs that try to imitate artificial neural networks (ANNs), L2ONN follows the physical nature of light-matter interaction, to fully explore the functional and performance potentials of wave optics in photonic computing.

Experimental evaluations on free-space and on-chip architectures demonstrate that L2ONN shows its extraordinary learning capability on challenging tens-of-tasks, such as vision classification, voice recognition, and medical diagnosis, supporting various new environments. L2ONN achieves up to 14 times larger capacity than existing optical neural networks, with an order of magnitude higher energy efficiency than the representative electronic artificial neural networks.

Conclusion:
Humans possess the unique ability to incrementally absorb, learn, and memorize knowledge. This ability is due to the sparse neuron connectivity and parallelly task-driven neurocognition mechanisms that contribute to lifelong memory consolidation and retrieval. Similarly, in ONNs, these characteristic features can be naturally promoted from biological neurons to photonic neurons based on the intrinsic sparsity and parallelism properties of optical operators. An optical architecture imitating the structure and function of human brains demonstrates its potential to alleviate the issues mentioned above, which shows more advantages than electronic approaches in constructing a viable lifelong learning computing system.

The proposed photonic lifelong learning provides a turnkey solution for large-scale real-life AI applications with unprecedented scalability and versatility. The proposed neuromorphic architecture will accelerate the development of more powerful photonic computing as critical support for modern advanced machine intelligence, leading to the beginning of a new era of AI.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/photonic-neuromorphic.jpg,2024-04-03 11:03:26,"Photonic Lifelong Learning: Revolutionizing AI Applications with Unmatched Energy Efficiency, Computational Throughput, and Scalability.

These substances are nearly impossible to break down and often end up in the products humans use and consume. Consequently, PFAS have been discovered in a wide range of tech devices, food, and even in human bodies. This poses potential health risks and contributes to pollution worldwide.

The US and EU's Joint Efforts

The US and the EU aim to identify research cooperation opportunities that could lead to alternatives for the use of PFAS in chip manufacturing. They plan to leverage AI capabilities and digital twins to expedite the discovery of suitable materials to replace PFAS in semiconductor manufacturing. The use of AI can help analyze vast amounts of data and predict potential outcomes, making it an invaluable tool in this endeavor.

The China Factor

One of the driving factors behind this initiative is the concern over China's heavy investment in mature semiconductor production. These chips, while not as powerful as their newer counterparts, are widely used in various industries and government applications. The West fears that without new manufacturing processes, China could become the leading global supplier of mature chips, creating an international security issue.

Addressing the PFAS Usage

The US-EU statement, however, lacks specifics on how exactly AI will be used to address the PFAS problem and how long it will take to implement the solution. The statement does mention that the countries intend to collect and share non-confidential information, consult each other on planned actions, and potentially develop joint or cooperative measures to address distortionary effects on the global supply chain for legacy semiconductors.

Conclusion

The collaboration between the US and the EU to eliminate harmful chemicals from the chipmaking process marks a significant step forward in the tech industry.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/75cb3f04376e89c4712855da0bb57423b4c34909/2024/04/03/7af06786-e7aa-4776-a896-e4bbf35bb42a/gettyimages-1939529904.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-03 00:00:00,"""Join US-EU AI Initiative: Combat harmful chemicals in chipmaking, replacing PFAS.

Do you want to take your business to the next level but lack the resources to do so? If so, Jobs for the Future's (JFF) new $50M fund may be the solution to your problems.

JFFVentures, the venture arm of JFF, has recently launched its second fund - JFFVentures Fund II. This fund aims to invest in underrepresented founders building HR, education, and workforce solutions that enable economic mobility for workers in middle to low-wage jobs.

JFFVentures Fund II has already raised $15 million, and its target is to raise an additional $35 million, bringing the total fund size to $50 million. The fund will invest in 30 to 35 pre-seed and seed-stage startups, with initial check sizes ranging from $250,000 to $1 million, with the ability to lead rounds. The fund will also reserve $1 million to $2 million for follow-on investments into companies that are performing well financially and impact-wise.

JFFVentures Fund II is not the first impact-focused venture fund in the US. Collaborative Fund, Third Sphere, and the nonprofit Acumen Fund are also examples of venture funds that aim to drive social, economic, and environmental change while earning investment returns. However, impact funds face challenges that traditional startup venture funds do not, such as measuring the real-world impact of investments and offering lower returns.

To overcome these challenges, JFFVentures Fund II will benefit from the wider JFF community, including its connections with government, corporate, education, and nonprofit partners. Founders in Fund II will have access to at least one dedicated person who can connect them with experts and networks across the JFF ecosystem.

JFFVentures Fund II's top priority is economic advancement for the underserved and underrepresented populations. The fund aims to invest in solutions that will empower women, disabled workers, immigrants, aging populations, and communities of color. JFFVentures has committed in its fund documents that at least 50% of Fund II founders will identify as underrepresented in terms of founder backgrounds. Additionally, part of the team has been allocated carry, which will be earned by hitting certain social impact goals.

While the 2021 study from Cambridge Associates found that impact venture funds tend to underperform, JFFVentures' inaugural fund performance serves as evidence that Fund II can succeed. Sixty-five percent of the first fund's 55 founders, 84% of whom self-identify as underrepresented in the VC space, have gone on to successfully raise capital from late-stage investors. JFFVentures is also reserving the right to invest up to 20% of Fund II in startups based outside of the US, giving the VC an additional lever to boost returns.

In conclusion, JFFVentures Fund II is an excellent opportunity for businesses to invest in solutions that enable economic mobility for workers in middle to low-wage jobs. The fund's focus on impact and its commitment to investing in underrepresented founders make it a valuable resource for those looking to make a positive impact while earning investment returns.

Are you interested in learning more about how AI can transform the security workforce? Join us in Atlanta on April 10th for an exclusive, invite-only event, in partnership with Microsoft, to discover how generative AI is transforming the security industry. Space is limited, so request an invite today!

In recent weeks, the world of technology has been buzzing with the advent of AI that can write code autonomously. One such example is Devin, an AI ""software engineer"" from startup Cognition that can write full code applications based on natural language instructions from a user. While this technology has great potential benefits for software developers and managers, it may not be as appealing to enterprises looking to maintain existing codebases and push updates to their software for employees or customers in high-security, highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, law, government, and telecommunications.

Another Israeli startup, Codium AI, is addressing this challenge by offering a software tool that enables enterprises to reap the benefits of autonomous AI coding while maintaining human oversight and compliance with regulations and existing software. Codiumate, a semi-autonomous AI agent, works alongside a human software developer or team. It takes any existing code snippets a human developer highlights in their environment and automatically generates step-by-step development plans based on it, writes code according to the plan, identifies duplicate code, drafts documentation for the code so that developers can reference it going forward, and suggests tests to ensure the code works properly before it is deployed for real in a live, production environment.

Writing code is just ""20 to 30 percent of what developers do,"" said Itamar Friedman, the co-founder and CEO of Codium, in a video call interview with VentureBeat. ""All the rest is meant to define what we do with our code, what we want to do with it, and check that it actually happened. That's what we're focused on at Codium AI.""

Friedman demonstrated the tool for me live during our call, showing how the user can drag their mouse cursor to highlight multiple code blocks in their development environment and instruct Codiumate to generate a plan for how they want to use that code. The agent presents the plan to the human user for review, which the human developer can then edit and adjust at will. Once a user is happy with the plan, they can click a button labeled ""start implementing the plan,"" and the Codiumate AI Agent will begin coding it for them. The agent will occasionally stop to ask the human user if what it is doing is correct, allowing time for the human user to edit the code or fix any issues as they see fit. It may also prompt the human developer to complete code or write code on their side in order for it to continue.

Codium hopes that Codiumate will aid developers in their workflow, speeding up all the manual typing they would otherwise have to do, doing the ""heavy lifting"" and mechanical coding work, while enabling the developer to act more as a hands-on product manager overseeing the process and course correcting it as necessary, almost as though it is a junior developer or new hire to the team.

The technology powering the Codiumate agent on the backend is ""best of breed"" OpenAI models, according to Friedman. The company is also experimenting with Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini. It also offers its own large language model (LLM) designed with its AlphaCodium process that increases the performance of other LLMs in code completion tasks. While the former is available to all users, the latter Codium LLM is only for paying enterprise users. Friedman said it is superior to OpenAI's models on coding and that a ""Fortune 10"" company that could not be named due to confidentiality reasons was already using it in production.

Addressing a growing market of AI tools that seek to offer security and anonymity to enterprise customers, Codiumate also practices ""zero retention,"" meaning that any code or information entered into it will be deleted immediately after the human user closes or ends their session with the tool.

In recent years, AI systems have become increasingly adept at mimicking human behavior, but their personalities remain limited to predetermined traits. In a groundbreaking study, Professor Takaya Arita and Associate Professor Reiji Suzuki from Nagoya University's Graduate School of Informatics have developed a framework for evolving AI agents that exhibit a diverse range of personality traits using large-scale language models (LLMs). Their findings, published in Scientific Reports, provide fascinating insights into the role of language in shaping AI personality and hint at the transformative potential of LLMs in AI research.

The study focused on developing a framework for evolving AI agents that could switch between selfish and cooperative actions, adapting their strategies through evolutionary processes. The researchers used the prisoner's dilemma from game theory as a starting point, creating a game in which both AI systems must choose whether to cooperate or defect from each other. If both agree to cooperate, they receive four virtual dollars, but if one defects while the other cooperates, the defector earns five dollars, and the cooperator earns nothing. If both defect, they receive one dollar each.

The researchers used LLMs to evolve prompts that encouraged more diverse personality traits during social interactions. By utilizing the remarkable capabilities of LLMs, they developed a framework where AI agents evolved based on natural language descriptions of personality traits encoded in their genes. Through this framework, they observed various types of personality traits, with the evolution of AIs capable of switching between selfish and cooperative behaviors, reflecting human behavior.

The study used an evolutionary framework, in which AI agents' abilities were shaped by natural selection and mutation over generations. This caused a wide range of personality traits to appear. Although some agents displayed selfish characteristics, prioritizing their own interests over those of the community or the group as a whole, other agents demonstrated advanced strategies that revolved around seeking personal gain while still considering mutual and collective benefit.

The researchers also discovered the instability inherent in AI societies, with excessively cooperative groups being replaced by more ""egocentric"" agents. This achievement underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in AI research, showing that the evolution of personality traits based on subtle linguistic expressions can be represented by a computational model using LLMs.

The findings of this study provide insights into the characteristics that AI agents should possess to contribute to human society, as well as design guidelines for AI societies and societies with mixed AI and human populations, which are expected to arrive in the not-too-distant future. In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of language in shaping AI personalities and the transformative potential of LLMs in AI research.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-scientists-amorphous-flexible-mini-inductor.html,Scientists develop novel amorphous flexible mini-inductor, Amorphous Flexible Mini-Inductor: A Novel Approach to Miniaturized Electronics,"INTRODUCTION

In today's world, the demand for miniaturized and energy-efficient electronic devices is increasing rapidly. To meet this demand, researchers have been exploring new materials and technologies to improve device performance, reduce energy consumption, and achieve miniaturization. One such material that has shown promising results in recent years is amorphous alloys.

Amorphous alloys are a type of material that lacks long-range atomic order, making them highly flexible and adaptable to various applications. In the field of electronics, amorphous alloys have been used to create flexible inductors, which are key components in power conversion and signal processing. In this article, we will explore the development of a new amorphous flexible mini-inductor by a research team at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

BODY

Flexible mini-inductors are essential in improving the performance of electronic devices, as they allow for greater energy density and reduced size. However, conventional coils made of non-magnetic materials inevitably cause magnetic leakage, which reduces the inductance density and makes them unsuitable for low-frequency applications.

To overcome this problem, Prof. Wang Junqiang and his team at NIMTE used Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous alloys as coil materials to fabricate an amorphous flexible mini-inductor. This novel device achieved both excellent flexibility and high inductance, making it ideal for low-frequency applications.

The team used high-precision femtosecond laser ablation technology to craft amorphous alloy ribbons without inducing the crystallization of the amorphous alloys, while maintaining their intrinsic mechanical excellence. This technique allowed for the fabrication of a mini-inductor with a high permeability and low magnetic leakage, making it ideal for applications where interference between electronic components must be minimized.

The developed amorphous flexible mini-inductor had an inductance density of about 280â€“390 nH/mm2, which is about 10 times higher than that of conventional planar inductors. Moreover, it could be stretched by 300% of its original size and maintain its performance after 2,500 bending cycles at a 16-mm bending radius. This superior stability and flexibility made it ideal for various bending and folding application environments.

The amorphous flexible mini-inductor also had a miniaturization advantage, as it could achieve high inductance density in a very small volume. This feature made it suitable for use in thin and light electronic products, such as wearable devices and smart sensors.

CONCLUSION

The development of the amorphous flexible mini-inductor by Prof. Wang Junqiang and his team at NIMTE represents a significant advancement in the field of flexible electronics. This novel device not only achieves high inductance density and flexibility but also has excellent stability and adaptability to various application environments.

The use of high-precision femtosecond laser ablation technology to fabricate the amorphous alloy ribbons without inducing crystallization is a promising approach that opens up new possibilities for the development of flexible electronics.

This study not only provides a new application scenario for amorphous soft magnetic alloys but also sheds light on the material selection and device design of flexible electronics technology. As the demand for miniaturized and energy-efficient electronic devices continues to grow, the development of new materials and technologies, such as the amorphous flexible mini-inductor, will play a crucial role in meeting these demands.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/scientists-develop-nov-1.jpg,2024-04-03 10:55:02,Develop amorphous flexible mini-inductor for energy-efficient electronics with high inductance density and flexibility.,Amorphous flexible mini-inductor development.,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

Imagine a world where managing chronic illnesses is made more accessible and efficient through affordable, in-home health monitoring. This vision is one step closer to reality, thanks to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They have developed a groundbreaking 3D printed miniature ionizer, a critical component of a mass spectrometer, which could pave the way for compact and cost-effective health monitoring devices.

The Power of Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a technique used to precisely identify the chemical components of a sample, making it an essential tool for monitoring the health of people with chronic illnesses. By measuring hormone levels in the blood, for example, mass spectrometers can help manage conditions like hypothyroidism. However, these machines can cost several hundred thousand dollars, making them inaccessible for many individuals.

A Vision for Affordable Health Monitoring

MIT principal research scientist Luis Fernando VelÃ¡squez-GarcÃ­a and his team envision a future where mass spectrometry is local and accessible for constant monitoring of chronic diseases. This vision includes a shoebox-sized device that people can use at home for regular testing. To make this a reality, the ionizerâ€”a crucial part of mass spectrometersâ€”needs to be inexpensive and user-friendly.

A Giant Leap: The 3D Printed Ionizer

The researchers have made substantial progress by creating a low-cost 3D printed ionizer that performs twice as well as its state-of-the-art counterparts. This miniature device, which measures just a few centimeters in size, can be manufactured in large quantities using efficient robotic assembly methods. This mass production process significantly reduces the cost compared to traditional ionizers, which require expensive hardware or clean-room construction.

How the 3D Printed Ionizer Works

The MIT team used binder jetting, a 3D printing process, to fabricate the ionizer's electrospray emitter. This process ensures high precision and effectiveness, followed by an electropolishing step that sharpens the emitter. The final touch is a coating of zinc oxide nanowires, which makes the emitter porous and allows it to filter and transport liquids efficiently",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/researchers-3d-print-k.jpg,2024-04-04 10:04:01,"""Revolutionize health monitoring with our 3D printed ionizer: Enhance mass spectrometry, lower costs, and enable home-based disease management.

In our quest for sustainable energy sources, the scientific community is continuously exploring innovative methods to optimize fuel production processes. One such approach that has shown great promise is the integration of magnetic fields with electrocatalysis, a technique that can significantly enhance the efficiency of clean fuel production.

The Importance of Electrocatalysis in Green Energy Technologies

Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in converting chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa, making it an essential component in various green-energy technologies. By utilizing catalysts that increase reaction rates without being consumed, electrocatalysis enables efficient transformation of fuels such as hydrogen and oxygen into electricity or water into hydrogen and oxygen, facilitating a cycle of clean energy.

However, existing electrocatalysis methods often fail to maximize the transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface, thus limiting the overall efficiency of the reaction. This shortcoming is a significant hurdle in our journey towards clean energy solutions.

Magnetic Fields and Electrocatalysis: A Promising Intersection

To address this challenge, scientists led by MagalÃ­ Lingenfelder at EPFL have developed a novel approach that leverages magnetic fields to enhance the efficiency of clean fuel production. The study, published in Nature Communications, explores the potential of magnetic fields in creating Lorentz forces, which in turn induce whirling motions that improve the movement of reactants and products at the catalyst surface.

This innovative method overcomes limitations posed by reactant scarcity, a common issue in reactions like the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is critical for fuel cells. By building a tool for observing the movement of ions in real time under a magnetic field, the researchers demonstrated a more consistent and rapid reaction, significantly improving the efficiency of reactions crucial for green hydrogen production.

A Practical Solution for Sustainable Energy Technologies

The new method has shown promising results, with more than a 50% boost in activity for the oxygen reduction reaction induced by magnetic fields on non-magnetic interfaces. This substantial increase in efficiency allows for the resolution of many fundamental controversies in the field by demonstrating the mechanisms and conditions needed for magnetic fields to enhance different electrocatalytic reactions involving gas products or reactants like hydrogen and oxygen.

In a groundbreaking development for the field of hard disk drives (HDD), research groups from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University have successfully demonstrated the viability of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium. This innovation paves the way for increased storage capacity in HDDs, leading to more efficient and cost-effective data storage solutions.

The current landscape of data centers is filled with hard disk drives relying on perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) to store information at areal densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/inÂ². However, to transition to higher areal densities, a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium consisting of FePt grains combined with heat-assisted laser writing is required. Enter heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), a method that can maintain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/inÂ², with the potential for densities larger than 10 Tbit/inÂ² based on a new principle that stores multiple recording levels of 3 or 4, compared to the binary level used in HDD technology.

In their study, published in Acta Materialia, the research team successfully arranged the FePt recording layers three-dimensionally. They achieved this by fabricating lattice-matched, FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer films, with Ru acting as a spacer layer. Measurements of the magnetization revealed that the two FePt layers have different Curie temperatures, enabling three-dimensional recording through laser power adjustment when writing.

The researchers also demonstrated the 3D recording principle through recording simulations, using a media model that mirrors the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media. This method has the potential to increase recording capacity by stacking recording layers in three dimensions, allowing for more digital information storage within fewer HDDs, and consequently, energy savings for data centers.

To further advance this technology, the researchers aim to develop processes to reduce the size of FePt grains, enhance orientation and magnetic anisotropy, and stack more FePt layers to create a media structure suitable for practical use in high-density HDDs. This breakthrough in 3D magnetic recording promises a significant leap in data storage capacity, making it an exciting development to watch",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/proof-of-principle-dem.jpg,2024-04-04 11:00:33,"Boost your data storage capacity with 3D magnetic recording breakthrough!

Apple is considering personal robotics as the next big product to maintain market dominance and generate new revenue streams. Bloomberg reported that Apple started exploring robots and electric vehicles at the same time, hoping to develop a machine that doesn't require human intervention.

Apple's robotics projects are still in their early stages, but the company has already started working on a mobile robot that follows users around their home and a table-top device that uses a robot to move a screen around. The idea behind the latter is to mimic head movements and can lock on to a single person in a group, potentially improving video call experiences. These robots are designed to move independently, and Apple is also exploring the use of algorithms for navigation. The home devices group is responsible for their development, and an engineer who worked on its abandoned EV initiative has joined the team.

However, robots are not like smartphones, which are essential in people's daily lives. Apple is worried about whether people would be willing to pay a premium for the robots it has in mind, and executives are still debating whether the company should continue working on these projects. Gurman previously reported that Apple may have sold its EV for $100,000 - if that's true, it had a significant potential to boost the company's revenue. However, the Apple Car is now off the table, and the company is focusing on the Vision Pro and new products for the home, which also includes a home hub device with an iPad-like display.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-ultra-lowpower-memory-neuromorphic.html,Researchers develop a novel ultra-low-power memory for neuromorphic computing, Ultra-Low Power Nano-Filament PCAM: A Leap in Neuromorphic Computing ,"Title: A Revolutionary Ultra-Low Power Phase Change Memory Device: The Future of Memory and Neuromorphic Computing

Introduction

In the realm of electronics and memory devices, the demand for high-speed, non-volatile memory with low power consumption is continuously growing. To address this need, a team of Korean researchers led by Professor Shinhyun Choi at the KAIST School of Electrical Engineering has developed a groundbreaking next-generation phase change memory (PCAM) device with ultra-low power consumption. This new PCAM device can potentially replace existing memory technologies, such as DRAM and NAND flash memory, and pave the way for neuromorphic computing in next-generation artificial intelligence hardware.

The Challenges of Conventional Phase Change Memory

Conventional phase change memory has faced several challenges, including an expensive fabrication process for highly scaled devices and high power consumption during operation. These issues have hindered the development of practical large-capacity memory products and the realization of neuromorphic computing systems. Although previous research efforts focused on reducing power consumption by shrinking the physical size of the device, these attempts were limited by increased fabrication costs and complexity.

The NFPCM: A Novel Solution

Professor Choi's team developed the Nano-Filament-based Phase Change Memory (NFPCM), a novel approach to solving the problems associated with conventional phase change memory. The NFPCM features an ultra-low power consumption phase change memory device that consumes 15 times less power than a conventional device fabricated with an expensive lithography tool.

The NFPCM operates by electrically forming a highly confined BEC (bipolar electronic conduction) to reduce the reset current. This is achieved by creating a very small nanometer (nm) scale phase changeable filament without relying on expensive fabrication processes. The simplicity of this approach results in a device with both low processing costs and ultra-low power consumption.

Comparing NFPCM with DRAM and NAND Flash Memory

DRAM, one of the most commonly used memory types, offers high speed but has volatile characteristics, meaning data is lost when power is turned off. NAND flash memory, a storage device, has slower read/write speeds but is non-volatile, preserving data even when the power is cut off.

NFPCM, however, combines the",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/researchers-develop-a-6.jpg,2024-04-04 10:04:57,"Meta Description:

Introduction

In a bid to avert a potential ban, TikTok recently released an economic impact report, highlighting its significant contribution to the US economy. The report revealed that the ByteDance-owned platform generated a staggering $14.7 billion for small to mid-size businesses (SMBs) in 2023, contributing to a total economic activity of $24.2 billion. With over 7 million US businesses relying on TikTok and 224,000 jobs supported by the platform, the company presents a compelling case for its continued existence.

The Economic Impact

The extensive study, conducted by economics forecasting group Oxford Economics, measured SMB activity on TikTok, including ad spend and return on investment (ROI). The group also utilized census data and other relevant metrics to arrive at their findings. The report indicates that California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois are the states with the most significant impacts.

A Tactical Release

The report's release closely follows the passing of a bill in the House of Representatives that could potentially ban TikTok. The bill received strong bipartisan support, with a 362-65 vote. While former President Trump had previously sought to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns, he has since reversed his position, claiming that Meta would benefit instead.

Rivals Capitalize on the Ban Speculation

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has been preparing for a possible TikTok ban or spin-off from ByteDance. Recently, Facebook introduced a new video player that defaults to showing videos in a vertical format, similar to TikTok's layout. Other short-form video platforms, such as YouTube, could also benefit from increased exposure should TikTok be banned, potentially paving the way for startups in the same space.

TikTok's Argument: Economic Impact

By emphasizing its substantial economic impact, TikTok is employing a strategic public relations approach. In 2020, a group of TikTok creators successfully blocked the Trump administration's TikTok ban, arguing that it would affect their professional opportunities and income. TikTok has been encouraging users to contact Congress via in","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1248389972.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-04 16:58:21,"Boosting US Economy by $24.2B, TikTok's impact on SMBs revealed - Act now to save the app!

TikTok's $1","Wide net to eliminate accounts

In a recent announcement, X, the renowned social media platform, has issued a warning to its users about an impending reduction in their follower counts. This development comes as X embarks on a comprehensive initiative to eradicate spam and bot accounts from its network, ensuring a more secure and authentic user experience.

X's Safety team, newly fortified with the appointments of Kylie McRoberts as Head of Safety and Yale Cohen as Head of Brand Safety and Advertiser Solutions, has initiated a significant, proactive measure. The company intends to eliminate accounts that violate its rules against platform manipulation and spam, with the ultimate goal of maintaining a spam-free environment.

In a tweet, X's Safety account stated, ""Today, we're kicking off a significant, proactive initiative to eliminate accounts that violate our Rules against platform manipulation and spam."" The company acknowledged that, while accuracy is crucial in identifying offending accounts, they are casting a wide net to ensure the platform's security and authenticity.

This move is part of Elon Musk's long-standing ambition to combat spam on X, a task that has proven more challenging than anticipated. Extensive job cuts have left Twitter's Trust & Safety team understaffed, and the Head of Safety position remained vacant for 10 months following the departures of Ella Irwin and Yoel Roth under Musk's tenure. Furthermore, advancements in AI have made it increasingly difficult to control the proliferation of spam.

Despite these challenges, X is pushing forward with its initiative. In a report by TechCrunch earlier this year, Musk's plan to require users to pay for Verification did not deter spammers from participating on the platform. Bots with Verified blue checks were discovered responding to posts with a variation of the phrase, ""I'm sorry, I cannot provide a response as it goes against OpenAI's use case policy.""

Moreover, a recent New York Intelligencer report detailed the surge in spam promoting adult content. This was achieved by posting explicit replies that directed users to links in the spammer's bio.

X's Safety team addressed this issue, stating, ""We will be casting a wide net to eliminate accounts that violate our policies, especially",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-may-have-finally-made-quantum-computing-useful-164501302.html,Microsoft may have finally made quantum computing useful, Microsoft's Quantum Breakthrough: 800x Lower Error Rate ,"Quantum computing has been an exhilarating prospect for years, but despite claims from tech giants like IBM, Google, and Microsoft, practical applications of the technology have remained elusive. Today, Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that they have developed the most error-free quantum computing system yet, a breakthrough that could finally pave the way for practical quantum computing.

Unlike classical computers, which rely on binary bits, quantum computers operate with qubits that can exist in a superposition of two states simultaneously. While this allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, it also makes them prone to errors. This is why today's quantum computers, known as NISQ computers, are only used for research and experimentation.

Microsoft's solution was to group physical qubits into virtual qubits, allowing it to apply error diagnostics and correction without destroying them. This resulted in an error rate that was 800 times better than relying on physical qubits alone. Microsoft claims it was able to run over 14,000 experiments without any errors.

According to Jason Zander, EVP of Microsoft's Strategic Missions and Technologies division, this achievement could finally bring us to ""Level 2 Resilient"" quantum computing, which would be reliable enough for practical applications. ""The task at hand for the entire quantum ecosystem is to increase the fidelity of qubits and enable fault-tolerant quantum computing so that we can use a quantum machine to unlock solutions to previously intractable problems,"" Zander wrote in a blog post.

Microsoft's announcement was met with enthusiasm from experts in the field, with Professor Aram Harrow of MIT calling the achievement a ""strong result."" ""The Quantinuum system has impressive error rates and control, so it was plausible that they could do an experiment like this, but it's encouraging to see that it worked,"" Harrow wrote in an email to Engadget.

Microsoft's Azure Quantum Elements will soon be available as a private preview, allowing researchers to get a taste of reliable quantum computing. The goal is to push even further to Level 3 quantum supercomputing, which could theoretically tackle incredibly complex issues like climate change and exotic drug research. However, it's unclear how long it will take to actually reach that point.

Professor Harrow cautioned that getting to a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer is still a long road, but the progress made on cold atom platforms has been impressive. ""This is an important step for this hardware platform,"" Harrow wrote. ""Along with the progress on neutral atoms, it means that the cold atom platforms are doing very well relative to their superconducting qubit competitors.""

In conclusion, Microsoft's breakthrough in developing the most error-free quantum computing system yet is a significant step towards practical quantum computing. With the launch of Azure Quantum Elements, researchers will be able to experiment with reliable quantum computing, paving the way for even more advancements in the future. While the task of achieving large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing is still a long road, this achievement marks a crucial milestone in the development of this exciting technology.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jrXMv5qLg.309TP8Q1Fq8g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/b0685660-f1d5-11ee-bcbf-23137a24dced,2024-04-03 16:45:01,"Microsoft develops the most error-free quantum computing system yet, marking a crucial milestone in the development of this exciting technology.

Resemble AI has already published several voice clone samples showcasing the prowess of the new technology, and VentureBeat has also tested the feature to see how it really works. The results were impressive, with Rapid Voice Cloning demonstrating exceptional accuracy and versatility.

However, during our own testing of the feature, we noticed a few gaps. The system mandated recording at least three long sentences, with no option to record a smaller 10-second sample. Additionally, the processing was swift but the system could not recognize the speaker's Indian accent and took the input by default as a voice sample in American English. However, Resemble AI has assured that Rapid Voice Cloning will support most English accents and improve over time.

The company will continue to provide the original cloning feature under the name of professional voice cloning, which supports all English accents with support for text-to-speech and speech-to-speech use cases. Rapid Voice Cloning, on the other hand, will support only text-to-speech generation.

Resemble AI's Rapid Voice Cloning is expected to be adopted by content creators and businesses looking to generate voiceovers, dubbing, narration, and dialogue for their podcasts, videos, audiobooks, and e-learning materials. The technology also offers enhanced accessibility and personalization experiences, such as creating a personalized AI coach that speaks to each user in a familiar voice, providing encouragement and guidance.

While it remains to be seen how the technology gets adopted, one thing is clear - Resemble AI is not the only player cutting down the time to generate voice clones. ElevenLabs, another major player in the category, offers a feature called Instant Voice Cloning that needs at least a minute of clear audio to generate a clone almost instantly. Like Resemble, ElevenLabs also offers a professional version of the technology.

Rewritten Instructions:

Setting up a new device is an exciting process, but it's also a time of uncertainty when it comes to privacy. A recent study from Aalto University sheds light on the privacy settings of Apple's default apps, the ones that are an integral part of the platform and ecosystem.

The researchers studied eight apps: Safari, Siri, Family Sharing, iMessage, FaceTime, Location Services, Find My, and Touch ID. They collected all publicly available privacy-related information on these apps, from technical documentation to privacy policies and user manuals.

The study revealed that users don't know what is going on when it comes to privacy settings, even with apps that are an integral part of the platform. For example, users are given the option to enable or disable Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. However, enabling only refers to whether they use Siri's voice control. Siri collects data in the background from other apps they use, regardless of their choice, unless they understand how to go into the settings and specifically change that.

Participants in the study were not able to stop data sharing in any of the apps. The instructions for restricting data access were complex and confusing, with the necessary steps scattered in different places. There was no clear direction on whether to go to the app settings, central settings, or both. Additionally, the instructions did not list all the necessary steps or explain how collected data is processed.

The researchers also demonstrated these problems experimentally. They interviewed users and asked them to try changing the settings. The participants were not able to prevent any of the apps from sharing their data with other applications or the service provider.

The study suggests that Apple could inform users much more clearly than it does today. They could provide detailed suggestions to clarify privacy settings and improve guidelines. For individual apps, the problem can be solved to some extent by opting for a third-party service.

In conclusion, setting up a new device requires persistent and expert clicking on each app individually. Apple's help falls short when it comes to privacy settings, which can make it difficult for users to protect their privacy on the platform. It's essential to be aware of the privacy settings of default apps and to make informed choices about the data they share.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/keeping-your-data-from.jpg,2024-04-03 13:44:03,"Discover the truth about Apple's default app privacy!

The Gulf Coast of the United States is no stranger to tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. These phenomena can cause widespread electricity outages, with the risk of such events only increasing due to climate change and global warming. A recent study by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany focused on the Texas power grid, aiming to identify the lines that should be reinforced to prevent serious outages in the future.

In their research, published in Nature Energy, the team compared two models for prioritizing power lines in need of hardening: a static model and a co-evolution model. The static model assigned priority based on factors such as line length, voltage, and the number of customers served, while the co-evolution model considered the dynamic interplay between evolving storm conditions and the partially destroyed state of the grid.

The researchers found that the co-evolution model provided a more accurate representation of the system, as it took into account the temporal-spatial structure of damages and outages, a topic with little preexisting research. By understanding the interplay between evolving storm conditions and the grid's damaged state, the team was better able to identify critical lines whose failure would most likely trigger large-scale blackouts.

This study highlights the importance of considering the historical context of damages when assessing a power grid's resilience. As every transmission line failure changes the topology and dynamics of the grid, the grid's response to future adverse weather events depends on the history of previous damages. By identifying the failure modes of complex but robust systems, the researchers aimed to prevent catastrophic failures and reinforce the ""backbone"" of the grid, ultimately enhancing its resilience against extreme wind events.

To increase the grid's resilience, the team suggests focusing on enhancing the resilience of critical lines identified by their models. This could be achieved by replacing overhead lines with underground cables, which offer better protection against wind damage. This method, however, should be carefully considered, as underground cables come with their own set of challenges, such as higher installation costs and limited repair capabilities during outages.

Apple, a company renowned for its innovative products, has recently signaled a shift towards artificial intelligence (AI) and home robotics. According to a report by Mark Gurman, Apple is exploring the development of personal robots, marking a potential pivot in its product roadmap. This move comes after the tech giant abandoned its electric car project and ramped up efforts in the AI space.

The rumored home robots encompass a mobile robot assistant that navigates around users' homes and an advanced tabletop device with a motorized display powered by robotics. The development of these projects falls under the purview of John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, who previously led machine intelligence, research, and search teams at Google. Additionally, Matt Costello and Brian Lynch, two Apple hardware group executives, have been overseeing the hardware aspect of the robots' development.

However, since these projects are still in their infancy and the company has yet to commit to them, there is no guarantee that the products will ever come to market. Despite this uncertainty, Apple's interest in home robotics is not uncharted territory. In the past, the company has considered creating a tabletop device with a display, as reported by 9to5Mac in February. This unreleased device was said to resemble a HomePod with a screen.

As Apple ventures into home robotics, it is essential to note that this market already features established players. Amazon, for instance, launched its robot assistant Astro in 2021, while Samsung's home assistant Ballie, a bowling ball-sized robot with various functionalities, is expected to hit the market in 2024.

This recent report coincides with a research paper published by Apple researchers this week, introducing the company's Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM), a model that could potentially enhance Siri's conversational abilities. This development indicates that Apple is gearing up to become a significant player in the AI and robotics space. An opportunity to witness this latest AI push may arise at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-simple-harvest-blue-energy.html,Researchers find a simple way to harvest more 'blue energy' from waves,"""Optimized TENG Captures 2.4x More 'Blue Energy' from Waves""","

If you've ever watched a surfer ride the waves, you know just how much power they possess. Now, scientists are one step closer to capturing the energy behind the ocean's constant ebb and flow with an improved ""blue energy"" harvesting device. Researchers have developed a liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that converts mechanical energy into electricity as water sloshes back and forth against the inside of a tube.

The TENG's electrode was originally placed at the center of the tube, but the researchers optimized the device's conversion of mechanical energy to electrical current by moving the electrode to the end where the water crashes with the most force. This new design increased the TENG's energy harvesting ability by 2.4 times.

The researchers conducted two experiments to demonstrate the potential of the device. In the first, they placed two TENGs on a benchtop and moved water back and forth within the tubes. The TENGs generated electrical currents by converting the friction from water hitting or sliding against the electrodes into electricity. In the second experiment, the TENG blinked an array of 35 LEDs on and off as water entered the section of the tube covered by the electrode and then flowed away.

The researchers say these demonstrations lay the foundation for larger-scale blue-energy harvesting from ocean waves and show the device's potential for other applications like wireless underwater signaling communications.

In summary, the researchers have optimized the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical current in a liquid-solid TENG by moving the electrode to the end of the tube where the water crashes with the most force. The new design increased the TENG's energy harvesting ability by 2.4 times, making it a promising device for capturing the energy behind the ocean's constant ebb and flow.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-tech-companies-artificial-general-intelligence.html,Tech companies want to build artificial general intelligence. But who decides when AGI is attained?,"Build AGI, but who decides its attainment? Tech companies aim to create a thinking machine, but risks and challenges persist. AGI's definition remains elusive, and the debate continues on how to measure it.","

Are we ready to build a machine that can think and act like a human? That's the ambitious goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a futuristic concept that's been gaining traction in the tech industry. AGI is a broadly smart machine that can perform a wide range of tasks, from reasoning and planning to learning from experiences.

The race to build AGI is on, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are investing heavily in this cutting-edge technology. However, AGI is not without its risks. Experts warn that unchecked AGIs with long-term planning skills could pose an existential threat to humanity.

While AGI is a buzzword that's constantly being redefined, it's not a technical term. Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist, prefers the term ""superintelligence"" for AGIs that are better than humans. However, AGI is a serious concept, and there is no clear definition of what it means.

Mainstream AI research has turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence, which was once an ambitious idea. Pei Wang, a professor who teaches an AGI course at Temple University, explains that the 'G' in AGI was a signal to those who still want to do the big thing. They don't want to build tools; they want to build a thinking machine.

So, are we at AGI yet? Without a clear definition, it's hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved AGI. However, some experts believe that AGI is a matter of when, not if. Improvements in autoregressive AI techniques and massive computing power have led to impressive chatbots, but they're not quite the AGI that many people had in mind.

To measure AGI, some researchers are working towards consensus on how to classify it. Others are planning to figure it out on their own, like OpenAI, which has given its nonprofit board of directors the responsibility of deciding when its AI systems have reached the point at which they ""outperform humans at most economically valuable work.""

In conclusion, AGI is a challenging yet exciting concept that has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about machines. While there are risks associated with AGI, the benefits of a thinking machine are too great to ignore. As we continue to push the boundaries of AI, it's crucial that we approach AGI with caution and careful consideration for its implications on humanity.

Google, the search engine giant, has built its empire on a free platform that has dominated the market for decades. However, with the increasing threat of new generative AI models, Google is preparing to revolutionize its business model.

According to a Financial Times report, Google is contemplating introducing a paywall to access premium generative AI features in its search engine. Under this plan, these advanced AI-powered search features would be added to Google's premium subscription service, Google One. Although engineers are working on the technology, Google executives have not yet decided when or if the paywall will be implemented.

Launched in February, Google One costs $20 per month and currently offers various perks such as 2TB of storage, Google Photos editing features, Google Store rewards, Google Meet premium video calling features, and Google Calendar enhanced appointment scheduling. Google's traditional search engine would remain free and ad-supported. However, the introduction of a paid search tier would mark a significant shift in Google's business model, which has kept its search engine free since its inception over two decades ago.

The primary reason for this potential change is the high cost of deploying and maintaining generative AI features on its search engine. However, there is no guarantee that people would be interested in such an AI-assisted search service, especially with numerous free competitors available. For instance, ChatGPT recently made access to its free chatbot easier by eliminating logins, allowing users to ask questions directly on the site.

Although Google has a distinct advantage as it doesn't have a knowledge cutoff, ChatGPT can still be an attractive option for users seeking information about topics before January 2022. Microsoft's Copilot is another strong competitor, offering conversationally based answers, access to the latest information, and no knowledge cutoff, all for free.

Despite the possibility of some of Google's AI-infused search features being behind a paywall soon, users can sign up for the Search Generative Experience (SGE) to experience Google's AI-infused search engine for free. Simply visit Search Labs and log in with your Google account.

In conclusion, Google's potential move towards a paid search tier could be a game-changer for the tech giant",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9ec88adb2d66a4ebb9a9c5e4a5948364fb2dfcd8/2024/04/04/eb95027f-78bc-45bf-b71d-20cdf86065ba/cointelescope-gettyimages-1361877833.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-04 00:00:00,"""Discover Google's AI-infused search for free or try their premium features with a Google One subscription.
