In the rapidly evolving world of technology, our biological data is becoming an increasingly valuable resource. From fingerprints to facial scans and DNA, tech companies have been handling and storing our sensitive information for years. Now, with the advent of neurotech wearables, brainwaves are the newest addition to this digital treasure trove. In response to growing privacy concerns, Colorado has taken a significant step forward by expanding its privacy law to include neural data.

Governor Jared Polis recently signed a bill that amends the state's existing privacy law to include brain activity under the umbrella of biological data. This category already includes fingerprints, facial images, and DNA. Previously, only fingerprints and facial images were protected in Colorado. The new bill defines biological data as ""data generated by the technological processing, measurement, or analysis of an individual's biological, genetic, biochemical, physiological, or neural properties, compositions, or activities or of an individual's body or bodily functions.""

Neurotech devices use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity using electrodes. Invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), like Neuralink or Synchron, are implanted in the body and regulated as medical devices, offering higher data protections. However, non-invasive neurotech, such as wearables that use EEG, are considered consumer devices and remain unregulated.

Companies like Emotiv and NeuroSky have been exploring EEG technology for fitness, digital health, and even perfume for nearly a decade. Today, an array of neurotech wearables is available, from headsets promising better athletic performance to headbands that assist with meditation. These devices track, analyze, and, in some cases, record brain activity.

The Colorado legislation was passed in response to growing concerns about privacy in consumer BCIs. The bill highlights the sensitivity of neural data, which can reveal intimate information about individuals, including health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive functioning. In the wrong hands, this data could be used against individuals by companies or third parties. A report from The Neurorights Foundation found that 29 out of 30 companies surveyed ""appear to have access to the consumer's",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/820ea336296662a7926f23cdc357dba24ee4aaa6/2024/04/22/1a7d7b8e-9f07-4dcb-bd11-d9fac3bf597d/gettyimages-1421511892.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-22 00:00:00,"New Colorado law protects neural data privacy; be informed, take control.

As an experienced user of both Linux and macOS, I appreciate the unique strengths of each operating system. While I find Linux to be the best option for my needs, I recognize that there is always room for improvement. In this article, we will explore six features from macOS that could greatly enhance the Linux experience.

1. Superior video and audio stacks

One area where macOS excels is in its video and audio capabilities. The video stack on macOS is renowned for its ability to play a wide range of formats smoothly and with excellent quality. Linux, on the other hand, often requires the installation of third-party codecs to play certain video formats, and the video quality doesn't always match that of macOS.

Similarly, macOS's audio stack is more robust and user-friendly than Linux's. Issues with audio drivers and software like Pulse Audio and Pipewire have plagued Linux users for years. A more plug-and-play approach to audio, similar to macOS, would significantly improve the Linux user experience.

2. Butter-smooth performance

The overall performance of macOS is renowned for its smoothness and fluidity. From animations to window movements, macOS provides a seamless user experience. While some Linux distributions have made strides in this area, there is still work to be done to achieve the same level of smoothness found in macOS.

3. Reliable multitouch gestures

The implementation of multitouch gestures on macOS is smooth and consistent. Linux distributions have attempted to replicate this feature, but the results are often hit or miss. A more reliable and consistent approach to multitouch gestures would greatly enhance the Linux user experience.

4. Improved mobile-to-desktop integration

The seamless integration between macOS and iOS is a significant advantage for Apple users. Unfortunately, the integration between Linux and Android, while possible through tools like KDE Connect and GSConnect, is not as straightforward or feature-rich. Improving the integration between Linux and mobile devices should be a priority for developers, given the increasing reliance on mobile devices in our daily lives.

5. Desirable applications

Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) have become an indispensable part of our daily lives, powering devices such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage systems. The core components of LiBs are lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, graphite anodes, and liquid electrolytes that facilitate ion transfer between the electrodes.

Traditional electrolytes, based on a 1.0 to 1.2 mol/L lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solution in carboxylic acid esters, have been the industry standard for over three decades. While these electrolytes have proven effective, they are expensive and less than ideal for sustainable and large-scale applications.

Recent developments have led to the emergence of high-concentration electrolytes (> 3 mol/L), which have shown improvements in battery performance. However, these electrolytes have high viscosity, poor wetting capability, and low conductivity, making them impractical for widespread use due to their high costs.

Ultralow-concentration electrolytes (< 0.3 mol/L) have also been explored to reduce costs, but their performance has been hindered by the decomposition of solvent, resulting in less stable organic-dominated interphase layers.

A breakthrough by researchers at Ningbo University (China) and the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (U.S.) has led to the development of an ultralow-concentration electrolyte with promising potential. The team created an electrolyte using a lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) salt and a commercial carbonate solvent, ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC).

I tested it against Llama, Gemini and ChatGPT - it wasn't even close"," AI Coding Capabilities: Meta AI Stumbles on Basic Tasks, But Shows Potential ","Title: Assessing the Code Writing Capabilities of AI Tools: A Deep Dive into Meta's New AI

Over the past year, I've been testing large language models to understand how well they handle basic programming tasks. The idea is to determine if they can assist programmers in completing more complex tasks. This article series has served as a benchmark, using four tests to evaluate the coding capabilities of various AI chatbots. In this installment, I put Meta's new Meta AI to the test.

Test 1: Writing a WordPress Plugin

The first test involves creating a WordPress plugin, which evaluates the AI's ability to perform basic web development using PHP and build a user interface. I compared Meta AI's performance to that of ChatGPT, Google Gemini Advanced, and Meta Code Llama.

Meta AI's plugin interface was adequate, but it failed to produce functional code, displaying the infamous ""White Screen of Death"" in WordPress. ChatGPT, on the other hand, excelled in both interface and functionality. Meta Code Llama completely failed, while Google Gemini Advanced had a good interface but failed functionally.

Test 2: Rewriting a String Function

This test focuses on updating a utility function for better functionality. Meta AI had issues with handling numbers with different decimal points and rejected correct numbers due to incorrect formatting. Meta Code Llama succeeded in this test, while Meta AI, Google Gemini Advanced, and ChatGPT all faced difficulties.

Test 3: Finding an Annoying Bug

This test requires deep knowledge of the WordPress API and understanding the interplay between various components of the program. Meta AI passed this test with flying colors, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the framework.

Test 4: Writing a Script

The final test involves programming using two specialized tools. This test is designed to assess the AI's knowledge beyond the big programming languages. Meta AI was not tested for this task in this article.

Wrap Up

Through these tests, Meta AI showed promising results in understanding the WordPress API and user interface design but struggled with basic programming tasks. While there is room for improvement, the potential of AI as a coding assistant is evident. As these tools continue to evolve, the coding landscape may experience significant shifts, offering new opportunities for developers and learners alike.

In a bold move to encourage the shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), Rivian is offering discounts of up to $5,000 and a year of free charging to customers trading in their gas-powered trucks and SUVs. This offer applies to three R1T pickup truck trims and one R1S SUV model, with the promotion targeting popular gas-guzzlers like the Ford F-150, Toyota Tacoma, Jeep Wrangler, Audi, and BMW models.

The campaign, which started on April 22, intends to woo owners of specific gas-powered vehicles, including 2018 or newer Ford F-150 trucks, Explorer, Expedition, and Bronco (excluding the Bronco Sport). Additionally, 2018 or newer Toyota Tacoma, Tundra, Highlander, 4Runner, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Wrangler, and Gladiator models are eligible for the trade-in. Furthermore, Audi Q5, Q7, Q8, and BMW X3, X5, X7 owners can take advantage of this promotion ([source](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23694986/rivian-trade-in-discount-ev-offer-ford-toyota-audi-bmw)).

To be eligible for the discount and free charging, customers must take delivery of their new Rivian EV by June 30, either by leasing or buying. This offer is a strategic response to the softening demand for premium and luxury EVs across the industry, with other automakers such as Ford, Lucid, and Tesla reducing prices to entice buyers.

Rivian's decision to focus on the trade-in of gas-powered trucks and SUVs is a strategic one, as these segments are traditionally dominated by internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Many legacy automakers have scaled back their plans to transition to battery-electric vehicles, favoring gas-powered vehicles and hybrids due to their consistent sales and profit marg","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-Rivian-R1S-10.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-23 02:10:34,"""Trade your gas guzzler for a Rivian EV: Get $5,000 off & free charging!

If you're interested in the Linux kernel, there are several resources you can follow, such as the Linux Kernel Mailing List and Linux Weekly News (LWN). However, for a broad and quick summary of the Linux kernel's state, attending Jonathan Corbet's state-of-the-kernel presentations at major Linux conferences is highly recommended.

At Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, Corbet, a Linux kernel developer and LWN's editor-in-chief, shared his insights on the current state of the Linux kernel. He agreed with Linus Torvalds' earlier assessment that the development of the next kernel, Linux 6.9, is calm, steady, and boring, which is good news. However, Corbet also pointed out some concerning news.

Bugs in the kernel can potentially be exploited to compromise the system, and since any bug could be a vulnerability, Linux kernel developers have started assigning CVE numbers to anything that could be a vulnerability in the future. As a result, there are now hundreds of Linux kernel CVEs.

To ensure the safety and security of your Linux systems, Corbet advised using long-term stable (LTS) kernel releases. These releases have fixed CVEs, and as new issues are patched, they're ported into the LTS kernels. However, LTS versions are now supported for only two years, not six.

To check your Linux kernel version, run the following command from the shell:

$ uname -r

If you're not using an LTS version, you might want to consider updating your main Linux distribution more often for security reasons.

In terms of development, the Linux kernel developers recently had their busiest cycle yet, with over 17,000 commits for the 6.7 kernel release. The forthcoming 6.9 release has around 14,000 commits, but what matters most is the quality and range of features.

Lastly, Corbet noted that the Linux kernel developer team has been trending in a good way, with at least 200 first-time contributors in each of the recent cycles. This wave of new programmers has kept the community vibrant and forward-moving.
