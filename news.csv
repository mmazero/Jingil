Introduction

As India, the world's largest democracy, commences its 2023 general election, the electoral process is plagued by a concerning issue - misinformation. With an internet user base of over 830 million, including a significant portion on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, India faces a daunting challenge in combating misinformation and disinformation. This article will delve into the surge of misinformation, its consequences, and the measures taken to tackle this issue, with a focus on the role of ""cheapfakes"" and deepfakes in the current climate.

The Misinformation Menace

Misinformation transcends merely affecting election fairness; it can lead to deadly consequences, including violence and an increase in hatred towards minorities. Pratik Sinha, co-founder of Indian fact-checking website Alt News, points out the deliberate creation of misinformation to polarize society. India's linguistic and cultural diversity further complicates the task of fact-checking, making it more difficult for organizations to filter misleading content.

Government Action and Criticisms

The Indian government has attempted to address the issue by updating its IT intermediary rules in 2022, requiring social media companies to remove misleading content within 72 hours of reporting. However, selective enforcement and vague laws have hindered progress. Google and Meta have announced measures to reduce misleading content, but critics argue that these efforts do not go far enough.

The Emergence of ""Cheapfakes"" and Deepfakes

""Cheapfakes,"" or content generated through less sophisticated alterations of images, videos, and audio, are widely circulated across social media platforms in India. According to Hamsini Hariharan, a subject matter expert at the U.K.-based fact-checking startup Logically, there has been a significant increase in the scale and sophistication of misinformation and disinformation over the past five years. Logically has reported a particular spike in attempts to cast doubt on electronic voting machines, with older claims being recirculated without proper context.

Social Media Companies' Role

A new chapter in promoting sustainability and greener internet habits

Ecosia, the tree planting search engine, announced the release of its very own cross-platform browser aimed at increasing its environmentally friendly online footprint. This new browser, compatible with Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android devices, is constructed upon the Chromium framework, ensuring similar functionality to Google's popular Chrome browser. By doing so, Ecosia hopes to attract users looking for a sustainable alternative without disrupting their usual web browsing routines significantly ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/26/ecosias-new-cross-platform-browser-aims-to-expand-its-sustainable-presence/)).

Available features include the option to personalize the landing page and modify or eliminate certain segments, such as ""top sites"" or ""climate impact,"" based on individual preferences. Michael Metcalf, Ecosia's Chief Product Officer, highlighted the importance of expanding the platform beyond search capabilities during a conversation with TechCrunch. He emphasized the need to meet users where they already are, thereby extending Ecosia's reach and enhancing opportunities for sustainable practices.

Alongside the new browser launch, Ecosia introduced an affiliate shopping program designed to support additional green initiatives. When utilizing the browser, users will encounter shopping site connections—such as Amazon, eBay, and Decathlon—underneath sponsored link sections. All revenue generated via these affiliates will contribute directly toward tree planting efforts and other environmental endeavors. According to Ecosia, every user who surfs daily generates approximately 25Wh of clean energy.

While encouraging reduced consumption remains crucial, Ecosia acknowledges the frequency of online shopping among users. Consequently, implementing the affiliate program offers individuals the chance to participate in giving back by merely changing their browsing habits. Future plans involve improving the affiliate shopping interface, integrating artificial intelligence chatbots, and incorporating further customizations to elevate the overall user experience.

Marketing strategies for the new browser primarily focus on existing Ecosia users numbering roughly 20 million, as well as appealing to casual green enthusiasts seeking minimal disruptions to their regular browsing patterns. Early beta tests demonstrated promising retention rates; however, no concrete information indicates whether switching to Ecosia's browser increases the volume of Ecosia searches.

Last year, Ecosia implemented several modifications to its search engine, including experiments with Google search provision in select regions like Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and the Philippines. Moreover, Ecosia recently achieved a significant milestone by planting over 200 million trees throughout 95,000 global locations. These accomplishments underscore Ecosia's commitment to fostering positive ecological impacts and inspiring greener digital behaviors moving forward.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ecosia-browser_light-mode_uk_3.jpg?resize=1200,853",2024-04-22 07:00:37,"Try Ecosia's new cross-platform green browser!
