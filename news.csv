Abhishek Bansal, Shadowfax's co-founder and chief executive, attributes the company's remarkable growth to the widespread adoption of quick-commerce in India. This trend has propelled Shadowfax's growth by 35%, enabling the company to expand its hyper-local arm and collaborate with numerous quick-commerce firms and direct-to-consumer brands.

Since its inception in 2015, Shadowfax has garnered over $220 million in primary and secondary transactions, demonstrating investor confidence in its innovative approach to logistics and delivery.

Amit Gupta, Partner and Head of India and Southeast Asia at TPG NewQuest, lauds Shadowfax's transformative impact on India's e-commerce logistics sector. Mirae Asset, another key investor, views logistics as a fundamental pillar of e-commerce and hyperlocal commerce, recognizing Shadowfax's role in enabling the growth of these markets.

Shadowfax's unwavering commitment to network expansion, organizational growth, and financial performance has solidified its position as a leading player in India's logistics industry. The company's resilience during challenging periods further underscores its dedication to delivering exceptional services to its clientele.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"

In the realm of digital discourse, the Supreme Court is deliberating the fate of two state laws that aim to regulate content moderation practices on social media platforms. These laws, one from Florida and the other from Texas, have sparked a heated debate about the boundaries of free speech and the role of government in shaping online content.

At the heart of the controversy lies the question of whether social media companies can be held accountable for the content they host, and to what extent they can restrict or remove certain types of content. The laws in question were enacted in response to concerns that social media platforms were censoring conservative voices and viewpoints.

However, critics argue that these laws are overly broad and could have far-reaching implications for online freedom of expression. They contend that the laws could potentially stifle legitimate discussions and limit the ability of individuals to share their thoughts and ideas freely online.

During oral arguments, several justices expressed their concerns about the potential impact of these laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the broad nature of the laws, highlighting the risk of unforeseen consequences. She emphasized the need for caution in regulating online speech, given the diverse and ever-evolving nature of the internet.

Justice Brett Kavannah delved into the First Amendment, emphasizing the importance of preventing suppression of speech by the government. He pointed out that the laws in question could potentially violate this fundamental principle.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, while appearing more sympathetic to the concerns raised against social media platforms, acknowledged the existence of Section 230, a longstanding law that protects internet companies' content moderation decisions. He suggested that this law could potentially preempt the state restrictions on social media moderation.

The Supreme Court's deliberations on these cases have the potential to reshape the future of online content regulation. The justices' decision could have a significant impact on the way social media platforms operate and the types of content they can host.

The outcome of these cases is eagerly anticipated, as it could set a precedent for how governments regulate online speech and the role of social media companies in shaping public discourse.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/inkitt-ai-publishing-37-million/,"Inkitt, the self-publishing platform using AI to develop bestsellers, nabs $37M","

In a world where everyone has a story to tell, Inkitt, a pioneering startup, is revolutionizing the entertainment industry with its AI-driven platform. Its mission? To transform compelling stories into blockbusters and build a 21st-century ""Disney"" empire around them.

Inkitt's journey began with its eponymous app, where aspiring writers can self-publish their stories. Using a combination of AI and data science, the platform identifies the most captivating tales, refines them, and distributes them on a second app called Galatea. This innovative approach has already garnered 33 million users and produced numerous bestsellers.

With a fresh infusion of $37 million in Series C funding, Inkitt is poised to expand its content horizons. The company plans to introduce AI-generated stories based on original ideas, personalized versions of fiction tailored to specific readers, and ventures into games, audiobooks, and video content. While humans currently produce the video content, the ultimate goal is to harness AI's power for this purpose as well.

CEO and founder Ali Albazaz envisions Inkitt as a multimedia empire, akin to a modern-day Disney, rather than a competitor to platforms like Wattpad. This vision is fueled by the belief that AI can unlock new avenues for storytelling and engagement.

Inkitt's success stands out in a challenging funding landscape for consumer-focused startups. Its current valuation of around $400 million post-money reflects the company's promising trajectory. While the valuation has seen a modest increase since the previous funding round, it remains a conservative move given the current funding climate.

In a world where reading time has declined due to the rise of mobile devices and instant gratification, Inkitt is swimming against the tide. The company believes that innovative storytelling methods, shorter chapters optimized for mobile reading, and dynamic effects can capture readers' attention and increase engagement.

Inkitt's data-driven approach extends to A/B testing every aspect of a story, from titles and plotlines to cliffhangers. This meticulous analysis provides valuable insights into reader preferences and helps Inkitt refine its content strategy.

The company's efforts have paid off, with Inkitt, Galatea, and Galatea TV experiencing a surge in engagement time despite the post-pandemic decline in other online services. Albazaz attributes this success to people's desire for escapism in these turbulent times.

Inkitt's success is further evidenced by its ranking as the 11th best-selling publisher globally, surpassing established names like Penguin Random House. Albazaz claims that Inkitt's algorithms boast a 20x higher success rate in publishing bestsellers compared to traditional publishers.

While Inkitt primarily focuses on fiction, it steers clear of literary fiction. Albazaz prefers to nurture undiscovered talent rather than navigate the complexities of working with established authors and their egos.

The company's future plans include exploring AI-generated stories based on human-crafted treatments and personalizing stories using AI algorithms. Albazaz acknowledges that personalization is an ongoing challenge, with Inkitt experimenting with varying degrees of changes to original works and even considering reader control over the narrative.

Inkitt's AI journey involves experimenting with various LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI, to construct narratives. The company also employs DeepL for automatic translation into 10 languages, ElevenLabs for audiobook narration, and Leonardo for cover art. This diverse mix of tools aims to achieve optimal results.

Despite the challenges of navigating IP concerns and the limitations of LLMs, Inkitt has found a niche in building an AI-powered content empire. Its lead investor, Vinod Khosla, believes that the future of entertainment lies in hyper-personalization, making Inkitt's mission and achievements a perfect fit.

Inkitt's journey is a testament to the power of AI in transforming the entertainment industry. As the company continues to push the boundaries of storytelling and engagement, it remains poised to redefine the way we consume and experience content.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/faa-completes-investigation-into-spacexs-second-fiery-starship-test/,FAA completes investigation into SpaceX's second fiery Starship test,"

In the realm of space exploration, SpaceX has faced a pivotal moment in its Starship program. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has concluded its review of SpaceX's investigation into the second Starship launch in November, accepting the company's findings and corrective actions.

While this marks the closure of the investigation, SpaceX must now implement these corrective measures and seek a modified launch license before resuming Starship flights. The FAA is currently evaluating SpaceX's license modification request and expects additional information before making a final decision.

The second orbital flight test of the colossal Starship rocket, standing at nearly 400 feet tall, showcased remarkable progress compared to the first test. All 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster ignited successfully, and the company executed a challenging ""hot-stage separation"" maneuver. However, the flight ended in a fiery explosion mid-air, prompting a mishap investigation led by SpaceX and reviewed by regulators.

The investigation revealed seven corrective actions for the booster and ten for the Starship vehicle. These actions range from hardware redesigns to increase robustness and reduce complexity to operational changes and analytical updates.

In a post-launch analysis, SpaceX shed light on the probable cause of the booster's explosion: a filter blockage in one of the Raptor engines. This failure led to a total loss of the booster. The Starship upper stage also encountered issues, with a propellant leak causing a fire that severed communication and triggered an autonomous flight termination system.

SpaceX has already incorporated some of these corrective actions into the vehicles earmarked for the third orbital flight test, which could take place as early as mid-March, according to CEO Elon Musk. The company's ultimate goal is to complete the full mission profile, including a controlled splashdown of the Super Heavy booster and a landing of the Starship in the Pacific Ocean.

SpaceX's unwavering commitment to recursive improvement and its relentless pursuit of a fully reusable launch system capable of carrying various payloads to diverse orbits and landing sites embody the spirit of innovation and exploration that drives the space industry forward.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/for-whom-the-ring-tolls/,"The Ring Car Cam appears to be finished, doomed by an unclear target market","

Ring Car Cam: Its Rise, Fall, and Lessons Learned

The Ring Car Cam, a gadget that promised to revolutionize automotive security, has officially met its demise. After a brief three-and-a-half-year stint in the market, Amazon has pulled the plug on this ill-fated device, leaving consumers wondering what went wrong.

The Ring Car Cam was initially hailed as a game-changer, an ingenious blend of home security and automotive technology. It aimed to be an ever-vigilant sentinel on wheels, extending the Ring security ecosystem into the realm of automobiles. However, the question of its target audience remained unanswered. Was it intended for security-conscious homeowners, tech-savvy car enthusiasts, or a broader demographic? This ambiguity proved to be one of its biggest hurdles.

While the Ring Car Cam had some innovative features, such as its OBD-II port connectivity and ""traffic stop"" mode, it faced stiff competition in the dashcam market. At $199, it was significantly more expensive than many other dashcams, and its $6 monthly subscription fee for ""connected"" features was seen as excessive.

The Ring Car Cam's reliance on the Amazon Alexa ecosystem was also a limiting factor. While Alexa has a large user base, it's hard to imagine many people being so committed to the platform that they would entrust the safety of their vehicles to a device that heavily relies on it.

Amazon's decision to discontinue the Ring Car Cam highlights the challenges of bringing new products to market, especially in a competitive and price-sensitive space like automotive security. It also serves as a reminder that clearly defining the target audience and offering compelling value are crucial for success.

The demise of the Ring Car Cam may also prompt a reassessment of consumer expectations for dashcams and automotive security devices. As technology becomes more integrated into every aspect of our lives, consumers are increasingly accustomed to having access to video coverage of their vehicles. This trend is likely to continue, and it will be interesting to see how other companies respond to this growing demand.

Tesla's Sentry Mode and the Ring Car Connect Product: A Failed Partnership

Tesla's Sentry Mode, a feature that allows Tesla vehicles to record video when parked, was initially promised to be made more accessible remotely through the Ring Car Connect product. However, this integration never materialized, and it seems that the project has been abandoned.

The discontinuation of the Ring Car Cam effectively puts an end to any hopes of a seamless integration between Tesla's Sentry Mode and Ring's security ecosystem. This is a missed opportunity for both companies, as it could have provided Tesla owners with a more comprehensive security solution for their vehicles.

The failure of the Ring Car Cam and the lack of progress on the Tesla Sentry Mode integration serve as cautionary tales for companies looking to collaborate on new products and services. Careful planning, clear communication, and a shared vision are essential for successful partnerships.

Reddit: The Next Meme Stock Phenomenon?

In a groundbreaking move, Reddit, the popular online forum, is inviting its devoted users to invest in its upcoming IPO. This exclusive opportunity has sparked excitement among Redditors, who see the potential for lucrative returns. However, the question looms: could Reddit become the next meme stock, with unpredictable and potentially disastrous consequences?

The Power of Reddit's Community

Reddit's strength lies in its vibrant community of users, who actively contribute content, moderate discussions, and shape the platform's culture. Recognizing this invaluable contribution, Reddit has set aside shares in its IPO specifically for these power users, granting them the same privilege typically reserved for institutional investors.

The Meme Stock Craze

The meteoric rise of meme stocks, fueled by social media hype and coordinated trading, has left an indelible mark on the stock market. Communities like Reddit's r/WallStreetBets have demonstrated their ability to influence stock prices, leading to both spectacular gains and devastating losses for investors.

Reddit's Potential as a Search Engine

Beyond its meme stock allure, Reddit is gaining traction as a potential search engine. The platform's vast and diverse content repository, coupled with its user-generated discussions, offers a unique and often more relevant alternative to traditional search engines. This untapped potential has attracted investors who see Reddit as a promising long-term investment.

Strained Relationship with Power Users

Reddit's relationship with its power users has faced challenges in recent times. Controversial API changes alienated many communities, leading to widespread protests and disruptions across the platform. Reddit's decision to offer early investment opportunities to these users is seen by some as an attempt to mend fences and acknowledge their crucial role in the platform's success.

Investing in Reddit: A Rational Prediction of Irrationality

Despite the inherent risks associated with meme stocks, some investors see Reddit's IPO as an opportunity to capitalize on the platform's potential for irrational exuberance. They believe that the loyal Reddit community, coupled with the platform's growing influence and potential as a search engine, could drive its stock price to unprecedented heights.

Conclusion

Reddit's IPO has ignited a mix of excitement and skepticism among investors. While the platform's devoted community and potential as a search engine hold promise, the specter of meme stock volatility looms large. Ultimately, the success of Reddit's IPO will hinge on its ability to balance the interests of its users, advertisers, and shareholders, while navigating the unpredictable waters of the stock market.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/lockbit-ransomware-takedown-now-what/,"Feds hack LockBit, LockBit springs back. Now what?","

In the realm of digital crime, the notorious LockBit ransomware group, hailing from Russia, has resurfaced on the dark web after a brief hiatus caused by a sweeping law enforcement operation. This resurgence marks a bold return for the cybercriminals, who have established a new leak site and already claimed several new victims.

The LockBit administrator, in a rather verbose statement, attributed the group's previous disruption to their own negligence. A global law enforcement effort, dubbed ""Operation Cronos,"" successfully infiltrated and seized control of LockBit's infrastructure, leading to the takedown of servers, cryptocurrency wallets, and the arrest of alleged members.

Despite this setback, LockBit has swiftly resumed operations, restoring from backups unaffected by the government takedown. The group's administrator has vowed retaliation, targeting the government sector in a defiant move.

While law enforcement agencies claim victory, the apparent LockBit ringleader, known as ""LockBitSupp,"" remains at large, threatening retaliation and actively targeting new victims. This ongoing cat-and-mouse game between authorities and cybercriminals continues to escalate, with bold claims and counterclaims flying from both sides.

The National Crime Agency (NCA), which spearheaded Operation Cronos, maintains that LockBit's systems have been compromised and destroyed. However, the agency's post on LockBit's own compromised dark web leak site reveals little concrete information about the elusive administrator, leaving many questions unanswered.

U.S. law enforcement agencies have offered a substantial reward for information leading to the identification or location of key LockBit leaders, suggesting that authorities lack crucial evidence or cannot yet establish a solid case.

The resilience of ransomware gangs is evident in the case of ALPHV (also known as BlackCat), which faced a similar law enforcement setback last year. Despite the seizure of its dark web leak site and the release of decryption keys, ALPHV quickly recovered, claiming that the FBI's decryption keys only benefited a fraction of the victims. Its leak site remains active, adding new victims daily.

Other notorious ransomware gangs like Hive and Conti have also faced law enforcement actions, only to rebrand and re-form under different names. This pattern suggests that the LockBit takedown, while significant, may not be the end of the group's criminal activities.

In its lengthy statement, LockBit claims that law enforcement obtained limited decryptors, arrested the wrong individuals, and failed to dismantle all of its websites. The group vows to upgrade its security, manually release decryptors, and continue its affiliate program, showing defiance in the face of adversity.

The NCA acknowledges that LockBit's regrouping efforts are likely, but emphasizes the agency's ongoing work to disrupt the group's activities. The agency's spokesperson, Richard Crowe, highlights the intelligence gathered and the continuous efforts to target and disrupt LockBit's operations.

The ongoing saga between law enforcement and LockBit serves as a reminder that the fight against cybercrime is far from over. The resilience and adaptability of these criminal groups pose significant challenges, and the battle to protect digital assets and data remains a critical priority for authorities and cybersecurity experts worldwide.

BlackCat Ransomware: The Culprit Behind the U.S. Healthcare Tech Giant's Cyberattack

The recent cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a U.S. healthcare tech giant, has been attributed to the infamous BlackCat ransomware group. This attack has caused widespread outages and disruptions in hospitals and pharmacies across the country.

A healthcare executive with knowledge of the incident confirmed that the company's executives attributed the cyberattack to BlackCat. This revelation aligns with Reuters' report, which cited sources familiar with the situation.

BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, is a notorious ransomware gang known for its sophisticated tactics. They often steal a victim's data before encrypting it, increasing the pressure for ransom payment. While they have not yet publicly claimed responsibility for the Change Healthcare attack, their modus operandi matches the observed patterns.

The attack has raised concerns about patient data security, as it's unclear whether any sensitive information was compromised. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Change Healthcare, initially mentioned a ""suspected nation-state"" threat actor but did not specify any particular government or state. This attribution remains questionable, as cybersecurity experts have not previously linked BlackCat to any nation-state.

Change Healthcare plays a crucial role in the U.S. healthcare system, processing prescriptions and billing for over 67,000 pharmacies. The cyberattack has significantly impacted healthcare facilities and pharmacies, causing difficulties in fulfilling and processing prescriptions through patients' insurance.

The American Hospital Association (AHA) has advised its members to consider disconnecting from Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, until it's deemed safe to reconnect. Columbia University and Tricare, the U.S. military's health insurance provider, have also taken precautionary measures to mitigate the impact of the cyberattack.

BlackCat has previously targeted other prominent organizations, including Norton, Reddit, and Fidelity National Financial.

The ongoing investigation aims to shed light on the extent of the attack and the potential involvement of nation-states. As the situation evolves, healthcare providers and patients alike anxiously await a resolution to restore normalcy to the U.S. healthcare system.

Instagram's Friend Map: A New Way to Stay Connected

Instagram is exploring a new feature called ""Friend Map,"" which will allow users to see the real-time locations of their friends who opt in. This feature resembles Snapchat's Snap Map and Apple's ""Find My"" map feature, providing users with another reason to spend time on Instagram and potentially reduce their reliance on other platforms.

The Friend Map will be an opt-in feature, meaning users have the choice to share their location with others. They can select who can see their location, whether it's followers who follow them back, their ""Close Friends"" list, or no one at all. Additionally, users can activate ""Ghost Mode"" to hide their last active location.

Instagram Notes, short messages that appear at the top of the direct messaging feed, will also be integrated into the Friend Map. Users can leave these short updates on the map for others to see, allowing them to share recommendations for local shops, restaurants, and more.

Instagram's Friend Map is still in the prototype stage and is not yet available for external testing. However, it aligns with Instagram's recent efforts to enhance its in-app map offering. In late 2022, the platform introduced a searchable map experience that enables users to explore popular tagged locations and filter results by categories.

This move by Instagram reflects the changing preferences of young users, who increasingly turn to social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok for discovering new places instead of traditional search engines or map apps. By introducing the Friend Map, Instagram aims to capitalize on this trend and further solidify its position as a go-to platform for social interaction and local exploration.

In the realm of social media, Instagram's Threads app is taking a page from its rival, X, by introducing a plethora of new features. These include trending topics, an in-app camera, drafts, and, most recently, a bookmarking feature that allows users to privately save posts for future reference.

Bookmarking has been a sought-after feature, especially among former X users and news enthusiasts. It enables users to curate a collection of links and posts they may need to revisit later, whether it's a long article they intend to read or a piece of information they want to remember. X's paid subscribers can even organize their bookmarks into folders for easier access.

While X's bookmarking icon is conveniently located at the bottom of each post, Threads' new feature is a bit more elusive. Instead of saving a post directly from the main timeline, users must tap on the three-dot menu to access the ""Save"" option. To view saved bookmarks, users need to navigate to the app's Settings screen.

The introduction of the bookmarking feature was met with mixed reactions from Threads users. Some expressed excitement, while others lamented not having access to the feature or other recently announced updates like trending topics. This is because Instagram is rolling out new Threads features in phases, gradually expanding availability to its user base. This phased approach is due to Threads' smaller engineering team compared to other Meta platforms and the app's substantial size, boasting over 130 million monthly active users.

In addition to bookmarking, Threads users have spotted other new features. Some users have reported receiving notifications from Threads and Facebook within their Instagram notifications. In an effort to boost app growth, Threads also began testing a cross-posting feature from Facebook to Threads.

As Threads continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how these new features will impact its user experience and whether they will help it gain traction against competitors like X.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/fervo-energy-fundraising/,"Geothermal startup Fervo Energy is tapping fresh $221M round, filing reveals","

In the realm of renewable energy, Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal startup, is making waves with its innovative approach to tapping the Earth's heat. The company has recently secured $221 million in funding, propelling its mission to harness the immense potential of geothermal energy.

Fervo's unique approach lies in its use of directional drilling techniques, similar to those employed in the oil and gas industry. These techniques allow the company to extend its wells far beyond their surface footprints, reaching deeper into the Earth's crust where temperatures soar.

To optimize its operations, Fervo employs fiber optic cables equipped with an array of sensors. These sensors provide real-time data on subsurface heat patterns and well performance, enabling the team to make informed decisions and maximize energy output.

Fervo's recent achievements are a testament to its dedication to innovation. In Utah, the company successfully completed a horizontal well in just 21 days, a remarkable feat considering it took 70% less time and half the cost compared to its initial well in 2022.

Furthermore, Fervo received a $25 million grant from the Department of Energy, recognizing its contributions to the advancement of geothermal energy. The company's previous funding round in July 2022 secured $138 million, attracting notable investors like BHP Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and Jeff Bezos.

In November, Fervo achieved a significant milestone by connecting its 3.5-megawatt Project Red power plant to the Nevada grid. This marked a historic moment, as it was the first of its kind, generating carbon-free electricity 24/7 without the need for battery storage.

The potential of geothermal energy in the United States is vast, with the Department of Energy estimating it could provide up to 90 gigawatts of electricity annually by 2050.
