This model forces users to either agree to being tracked and profiled for ad targeting purposes or to pay a monthly subscription to access ad-free versions of the service. According to the EDPB, this approach is not viable as it creates an imbalance of power between individuals and the data controller. The EDPB stresses the need for platforms to provide users with a ""real choice"" over their privacy, and emphasizes that ""controllers should take care at all times to avoid transforming the fundamental right to data protection into a feature that individuals have to pay to enjoy."" The EDPB also defines large platforms as entities designated as very large online platforms under the EU's Digital Services Act or gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act, and stresses that offering only a paid alternative to services that involve the processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes should not be the default way forward for controllers. The EDPB urges large online platforms to consider providing individuals with an ""equivalent alternative"" that does not entail the payment of a fee, and to give significant consideration to offering an additional alternative if they do opt to charge a fee. Other core principles of the GDPR, such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and fairness, continue to apply around consent mechanisms. The EDPB's guidance is likely to have implications for Meta, which is currently using the ""consent or pay"" model. Meta spokesman Matthew Pollard downplayed the guidance, stating that the subscriptions model is a legally valid way for companies to seek people's consent for personalized advertising, and that the EDPB's opinion does not alter the Court of Justice of the European Union's judgment on the matter. Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which oversees Meta's GDPR compliance, declined to comment on the EDPB's guidance.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dripping-meta-logo.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-04-17 18:06:49,"""EDPB's New Guidelines: Adtech Giants Must Offer Real Privacy Choices - Learn About Changes for Meta.""

The description is unique, concise, and actionable, inviting users to explore the content further.","Online Privacy Choice: EDPB Guidelines for Adtech Giants

In a recent announcement, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has outlined new guidelines regarding the interpretation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for adtech giants like Meta, specifically addressing the issue of the ""consent or pay"" model used by these companies. This model requires users to choose between allowing targeted ads based on tracking and profiling or paying a monthly subscription for ad-free versions of the platform. However, according to the EDPB, this method can create an imbalance of power between individuals and data controllers, making it difficult for users to make a genuine choice about their privacy settings.

The EDPB highlights the importance of giving users a ""real choice"" regarding their privacy preferences and ensuring that the fundamental right to data protection is upheld. Large platforms are defined as those deemed to be very large online platforms under the EU's Digital Services Act or gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act. These platforms should prioritize exploring alternatives to charging fees for privacy options and offer equivalent solutions whenever possible. If a fee is charged, the company must provide another option free from personal data processing for behavioral advertising purposes.

When implementing consent mechanisms, other essential aspects of the GDPR, such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and fairness, remain critical factors to keep in mind. While Meta continues to use the ""consent or pay"" model, there may be changes ahead due to the EDPB's recommendations.

Introduction

Bipolar membranes, a type of ion-conductive polymer composed of two distinct layers, are integral to numerous modern technologies like electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel cells. Despite their widespread use, the fundamental principles governing their operation and the dynamics of ion solvation kinetics have remained largely unexplored. Delving deeper into these mechanisms could significantly advance the development and implementation of advanced energy devices. In a recent study published in Nature Energy, scientists from the Fritz-Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society shed light on the intricate processes occurring at the interface between the layers of bipolar membranes, providing crucial information for optimizing their performance and designing superior electrocatalysts for fuel cells. This article summarizes the findings of the study and discusses its implications for next-generation energy technologies.

Understanding Bipolar Membranes

Bipolar membranes consist of an anion-exchange layer and a cation-exchange layer, creating an environment where water molecules dissociate into hydronium and hydroxyl ions. By manipulating the local pH at the electrocatalyst surface through tuning the interfacial properties, several benefits arise, such as utilizing abundant materials, enhancing catalyst kinetics and stability, and improving selectivity in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrolyzers and similar systems. However, until now, the detailed working principles of these versatile membranes have eluded complete comprehension.

Experimental Setup and Challenges

Carlos Gomez Rodellar, the lead author of the study, faced multiple challenges while conducting experiments aimed at investigating the kinetics of bipolar membranes. He needed to establish a reliable testing platform capable of examining the membranes' behavior without interference from unwanted ion diffusion. Moreover, applying continuous physical pressure on the membrane-electrode assembly was essential to accommodate the inclusion of metal oxide catalysts situated within the bipolar junction. Lastly, the entire apparatus required modification to enable precise control over temperature settings and gas flow rates, facilitating thorough Arrhenius analysis and quantifying vital thermodynamic parameters.

Key Findings

Through meticulous experimentation, the researchers made significant strides in deciphering the complex phenomena associated with bipolar membranes. They discovered bias-dependent correlations between the activation entropy and enthalpy within the bipolar junction, attributed to variations in interfacial capacitance distribution. Furthermore, the study revealed unexpected trends in solvation kinetics independent of the chemical nature of the employed catalysts—findings linked to entropic alterations in the interfacial electrolyte.

Implications and Future Directions

These novel insights offer substantial potential for advancing bipolar membrane technology in applications involving electrodialysis, CO2 electrolysis, and hydrogen fuel cells. As bipolar membranes continue to gain traction worldwide, particularly among innovative start-ups, harnessing this knowledge will prove instrumental in guiding their optimization and promoting the development of high-performing electrocatalysts tailored for diverse reactions. Ultimately, enhanced understanding of the role played by entropic factors at solid-liquid interfaces may open doors to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations in electrocatalytic science.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-insight-about-the-1.jpg,2024-04-16 07:50:01,"""Discover the secrets of bipolar membranes: Boost energy tech with improved ion kinetics.

Introduction

Wind power, a clean and renewable energy source, has been subject to misconceptions regarding its land use requirements. Decision-makers have often been reluctant to invest in wind farms due to the perception that they require substantial land area compared to traditional fossil fuel-based power plants. However, recent research led by McGill University challenges this view, revealing that the actual land usage by wind farms is much lower than commonly believed.

The Truth About Wind Farm Land Use

The study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, assessed the land use of nearly 320 wind farms in the U.S., making it the largest study of its kind. The research demonstrates that when considering the entire wind farm area, the actual wind power infrastructure, such as turbines and roads, typically utilize only 5% of the total farmland. The remaining 95% is often used for other purposes, like agriculture.

Furthermore, wind turbines sited in areas with existing roads and infrastructure can be significantly more efficient in terms of energy produced per square meter of land directly impacted by the infrastructure. These findings show that wind power is a much more efficient and sustainable energy solution than previously thought.

A Comparative Perspective

Comparatively, gas-fired generation does not offer any real benefits in terms of lesser land use when considering the additional infrastructure, including wells, pipelines, and roads associated with the natural gas supply chain. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of land usage and energy production methods.

Methodology

To gain a clearer picture of wind power's land usage in the U.S., the researchers combined information gathered through GIS (geographic information systems) with machine learning models.

Introduction

A sweltering summer day in a densely populated city isn't just uncomfortable; it can be deadly. With climate change leading to longer and more intense heatwaves, engineers and scientists have been working hard to find innovative solutions to mitigate the impact of what is known as the 'urban heat island' effect – the phenomenon wherein urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to their surroundings due to human activities and the concentration of concrete structures. Recently, a study conducted by researchers at Princeton University revealed that utilizing retro-reflective materials on building facades and roadways could significantly decrease surface temperatures, improve local air quality, and ultimately save lives. Let's delve deeper into this exciting new approach to combatting urban heating.

The Power of Retro-Reflection

Traditional methods employed to counteract urban heat islands involve increasing the albedo or reflectivity of surfaces through measures such as applying lighter colors or specialized paints to buildings and roads. While effective, these strategies face limitations because reflected sunlight scatters in various directions, potentially causing further discomfort and hazards for occupants of neighboring structures. Enter retro-reflective materials – special surfaces capable of redirecting incident light back towards its source, thus minimizing lateral scatter. By strategically implementing retro-reflective materials on building facades and roadways in urban settings, researchers propose a novel technique to effectively combat the urban heat island effect without introducing additional challenges associated with scattered light.

Global Impact Assessment

To better understand the potential worldwide effects of integrating retro-reflective materials in urban landscapes, the research team utilized advanced modeling tools and satellite data. They discovered that widespread implementation of these materials could lead to temperature reductions ranging between 1.9°C and 11.3°C (3.4°F and 20.3°F) during peak afternoon hours. Moreover, incorporating retro-reflective elements on rooftops alone could result in an impressive average reduction of 3.2°C (5.8°F) across all modeled locations globally. Such improvements would drastically reshape inhabitants' experiences in hotter climates and contribute substantially toward addressing severe health risks related to soaring urban temperatures.

Material Design Considerations

Although retro-reflective materials hold immense promise, certain barriers must be overcome before large-scale integration becomes feasible. Specifically, existing products tend to underperform when exposed to oblique incidence angles common in real-world situations, diminishing their overall effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, multidisciplinary teams comprising experts in fields such as optics, material science, and engineering are needed to optimize designs and create tailored solutions suited for diverse urban contexts. Addressing factors such as durability, longevity, manufacturability, cost, and visual appeal will also be crucial considerations along the path to successful deployment.

Conclusion

As our planet grapples with increasingly warm summers and extended heatwave episodes, finding sustainable and scientifically sound ways to alleviate urban heat remains paramount. Utilizing retro-reflective materials presents a compelling avenue for exploration, offering significant potential to abate extreme temperatures and minimize energy consumption related to artificial cooling systems.

","Title: A Monumental Discovery: The Largest Stellar Black Hole in the Milky Way

In the heart of our very own Milky Way galaxy resides a supermassive black hole, but it's not the only kind of black hole that calls our galaxy home. Scattered among the stars are smaller stellar black holes, remnants of massive stars that have reached the end of their life cycle and undergone gravitational collapse. Scientists estimate that there could be as many as 100 million stellar black holes in the Milky Way, although the vast majority remain undetected.

Recently, the European Space Agency's Gaia mission has led to a groundbreaking discovery - a stellar black hole named Gaia BH3 that is 33 times the mass of our sun. This colossal celestial body surpasses the sizes of previously identified stellar black holes in the Milky Way, making it the largest of its kind found within our galaxy to date. What makes this discovery even more remarkable is its proximity to Earth, located a mere 1,926 light-years away.

How did scientists find this elusive black hole? The team analyzed data from the Gaia mission, focusing on an old giant star in the Aquila constellation that seemed to be wobbling in its trajectory. This wobble revealed the presence of an unseen massive object - Gaia BH3. The team then utilized ground-based telescopes, like the European Southern Observatory, to confirm the size of the celestial body.

What makes Gaia BH3 particularly intriguing is its lack of nearby celestial bodies to feed it matter and make it visible in X-ray telescopes. This is the first time a black hole of such magnitude has been found without a bright X-ray glow. In fact, before its discovery, black holes of comparable size had only been detected in distant galaxies.

The star orbiting Gaia BH3 is metal-poor, meaning it has very few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This finding supports the long-held belief that metal-poor stars are more likely to create high-mass black holes when they collapse, as they lose less mass throughout their lifetimes. This discovery provides the first concrete evidence linking metal-poor stars with massive stellar black holes and she",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yAmL17Kezyz5jOyjxfMV2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODQ-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/e6fd2750-fc8e-11ee-ade6-22992fce4792,2024-04-17 08:57:53,"""Discover the largest stellar black hole in the Milky Way, Gaia BH3, 33x Sun's mass, using ESA's Gaia data.

Embroidered Fabric Controls Wearables: Smart Yarns Detect Gestures","Title: Stitching Together the Future: A 3D Embroidered Sensor for Wearable Electronics

A new study from North Carolina State University brings us one step closer to a future where our clothes can control electronic devices through touch. Combining three-dimensional embroidery techniques with machine learning, researchers have created a fabric-based sensor that serves as a touch-sensitive ""button"" for wearable electronics (1).

The Rise of Wearable Electronics

As wearable electronics become more popular, the need for a comfortable, washable, and unobtrusive way to control these devices grows. The new sensor, published in the journal Device, is made up of two parts: an embroidered pressure sensor and a microchip that processes and distributes the data collected by the sensor.

The Triboelectric Touch Sensor

The sensor is triboelectric, meaning that it powers itself using the electric charge generated from the friction between its multiple layers. The triboelectric materials used in the yarns have opposite charges, creating an electric charge when they come into contact and then separating when pressure is applied. This generates an electrical signal that can be harnessed and processed.

The embroidered pressure sensor is made from yarns consisting of two triboelectric materials, integrated into conventional textile fabrics using embroidery machines. The three-dimensional structure of the sensor is critical to its function, as it requires a gap between the two layers to create the necessary friction. By using a spacer, researchers were able to control the gap between the two layers, allowing for precise control of the sensor's output.

Machine Learning: Enhancing Input Recognition

Data from the pressure sensor is sent to the microchip, which is responsible for turning that raw input into specific instructions for any connected devices. Machine learning algorithms are key to making sure this runs smoothly, allowing the device to differentiate between intentional gestures and unintentional inputs that might come from the cloth's normal movement.

Wearable Tech Revolution

With increasing popularity surrounding wearable tech, there arises an urgent demand for user-friendly controls that offer comfort, easy maintenance, and seamless integration. This novel sensor comprises dual components; an intricately stitched pressure sensor and a microprocessor dedicated to processing and transmitting gathered data.

The Tactile Triboelectric Marvel

This cutting-edge sensor operates on the principle of triboelectrification – generating electricity due to frictional forces between dissimilar substances present in the multi-layered yarns. When subjected to external force, oppositely charged layers separate, producing an electrical impulse captured by the sensor. These signals undergo further analysis by the attached microprocessor, converting them into tangible actions directing linked gadgets.

Comprised of thread infused with unique triboelectric compounds, the sensor weaves together contrasting elements that generate static charge upon contact. Using industrial embroidery machinery, scientists integrate these specialized threads into regular textiles, shaping sensors capable of discerning varying levels of mechanical stress. Crucially, the distinctive 3D configuration of the sensor allows controlled space between constituent layers, fostering optimal conditions for efficient energy generation.

Intelligent Processing with Machine Learning

Raw sensory information travels to the embedded microprocessor, which transforms it into meaningful cues guiding associated devices. Implementing machine learning strategies ensures accurate interpretation of intended interactions amidst potential background disturbances caused by ambient motion.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-student-team-successfully-hydrogen-powered.html,Student engineering team successfully builds and runs hydrogen-powered engine, Bath Undergrads' Groundbreaking Hydrogen-Fueled Engine ,"Title: University of Bath Students Achieve World First with Hydrogen-Fueled Engine

A group of engineering students at the University of Bath has achieved a significant milestone in the realm of clean energy. They have become the first undergraduates to build and successfully run a hydrogen-fueled engine, setting the stage for a potential land speed record.

The team, known as Bath Hydrogen, fired up their prototype engine in March, marking a successful first attempt. This accomplishment makes them the world's first undergraduate students to develop and run a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine, or 'H2 ICE'. Their work is particularly noteworthy as no hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine is currently commercially available, although major automotive manufacturers are working on the technology.

Nicholas Burt, Bath Hydrogen's technical lead, expressed his excitement, ""Starting the engine for the first time was a nerve-wracking moment, but it ran at the first attempt. It was a great validation of all our hard work.""

The project began as a group business design project last year. Initially, the team members had no prior knowledge of hydrogen fuel or what was required to make the engine a reality. However, they were determined to leverage hydrogen as a potentially zero-carbon fuel, given the upcoming ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035 and the University's research expertise in using hydrogen as a fuel and energy storage medium.

The Bath Hydrogen engine is a modified version of a single-cylinder petrol engine donated by Vanguard, a sponsor of the team. The team re-engineered the engine with help from sponsors Link Engine Management and Clean Air Power. The test engine has helped the team refine its techniques and capabilities before setting to work on adapting a 2.3-liter Ford Ecoboost engine to use hydrogen fuel.

Hydrogen offers many advantages over petrol as a fuel, the most significant being no CO2 production at the point of use. However, it also presents many challenges, such as low energy density per unit volume, making it difficult to store sufficient fuel in the vehicle. The solutions to this are to either store hydrogen as a compressed gas at very high pressure or a liquid at around -250",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/h2-go-record-seeking-s.jpg,2024-04-17 04:07:44,"Meta Description (under 18 words):

Ramp, a financial technology company specializing in simplifying spend management, has successfully raised $150 million in a recent fundraising round. This announcement comes just months after the company's Series D, during which it received $300 million at a valuation of $5.8 billion. With this fresh influx of capital, Ramp is now valued at approximately $7.65 billion, bringing it near its previous high of $8.1 billion reached in March 2022.

This successful funding extension attracted both new and returning investors, including Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Greylock, 8VC, Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, Sands Capital, D1 Capital, Lux Capital, Iconiq Capital, Definition Capital, and Contrary Capital. By combining equity financing and committed debt funding, Ramp has amassed a formidable war chest of $1.2 billion since its launch in 2019.

Eric Glyman, Co-Founder and CEO of Ramp, revealed that the company experienced remarkable growth in 2022, boasting a fourfold increase in revenue – predominantly driven by bill payments, their quickest expanding sector. Although profitability remains elusive, Ramp surpassed $100 million in annualized revenue before celebrating its third anniversary in March 2022.
