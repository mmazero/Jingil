In the realm of mobile technology, the concept of foldable devices has taken center stage, and Lenovo/Motorola has unveiled a captivating addition to this innovative landscape at the recent MWC event. This groundbreaking device, aptly named the Rollable Concept Phone, showcases Lenovo's daring approach to design and their pursuit of unconventional form factors.

Unlike the transparent laptop that garnered attention yesterday, the Rollable Concept Phone stands as a prime example of what concept devices should strive to be. It embodies the essence of experimentation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of mobile devices.

However, it's crucial to emphasize that this device remains a concept, with no guarantee of ever reaching the production stage. Lenovo's cautious approach to demos highlights the challenges associated with ensuring the device's durability and reliability.

Before the advent of Samsung's Galaxy Fold, the idea of a foldable phone often conjured images of devices that could bend at multiple points. While rollable displays aren't entirely new, there are practical obstacles hindering their mass production.

The early days of the Galaxy Fold serve as a cautionary tale, reminding us that rigorous testing is essential before releasing a new product into the real world. Lenovo's decision to showcase the Rollable Concept Phone at MWC is a strategic move to gauge public interest and assess its potential viability.

The rollable design offers distinct advantages over foldable devices. Its lack of a crease allows for a seamless transition between different screen sizes, making it highly versatile. However, this benefit comes at the cost of sacrificing the ability to snap the device shut and easily store it in a pocket.

Despite the limited information available, the Rollable Concept Phone features a fabric backing, which provides flexibility while raising questions about its maintenance. The device's operating system adapts to its orientation, prioritizing the most relevant part of the screen.

Lenovo remains tight-lipped about the number of batteries powering the device, but it's likely that multiple batteries are employed to ensure flexibility. The rigid components are strategically distributed to maintain structural integrity.

Among the manufacturers exploring foldable devices, Lenovo stands out as a company unafraid to venture into uncharted territories. Their willingness to experiment with unconventional designs is commendable, although its impact on actual product sales remains uncertain.

The initial skepticism surrounding foldable devices has gradually given way to acceptance, with the category gaining traction in the smartphone market. As the industry awaits Apple's potential entry into this space, the Rollable Concept Phone serves as a testament to the ongoing evolution of mobile technology.

While questions linger about its durability, practicality, and potential for everyday use, the Rollable Concept Phone captivates with its novelty and unconventional charm. It's a device that sparks curiosity and invites exploration, blurring the boundaries between technology and imagination.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/subsets-uses-explainable-ai-to-help-subscription-media-companies-reduce-customer-churn/,Subsets helps subscription businesses reduce churn with 'retention experiments' and explainable AI,"

In the business world, recurring revenue is the holy grail. Subscription-based business models have become increasingly popular, but they come with unique challenges. Companies must not only attract new subscribers but also retain existing ones to minimize churn.

Enter Subsets, a Danish startup that aims to bridge the retention gap in the subscription industry. Founded in 2022, Subsets utilizes AI-powered technology to identify subscribers at risk of canceling and provides actionable insights to entice them to stay.

Subsets' AI is explainable, meaning it can justify its decisions and insights in a way that humans can understand. This transparency is crucial in building trust and confidence in the platform.

With notable clients like The New York Times-owned Athletic and Danish newspaper Børsen, Subsets has gained traction in the media industry. However, the company has plans to expand into other digital consumer subscription categories such as mobility, banking, and food delivery.

To enhance its capabilities, Subsets recently secured $1.65 million in pre-seed funding led by Nordic early-stage VC Upfin and Y Combinator (YC). This investment will fuel the company's growth and product development.

Subsets' platform seamlessly integrates with various internal systems, such as CRM, CMS, billing, and data warehouses, to gather subscriber data. This data is then analyzed to identify churn audiences and understand their behavior patterns.

The platform's user-friendly interface allows non-technical teams to conduct retention experiments on specific subscriber subsets. These experiments can include push notifications, email offers, or free upgrades to test their effectiveness in reducing churn.

The results of these experiments are presented in a clear and concise manner, showcasing what strategies have been successful in retaining subscribers. This data-driven approach helps companies optimize their retention efforts and automate effective strategies.

Subsets' AI algorithms leverage gradient-boosting models and temporal sequencing methods to predict churn-driving behavior. The platform also incorporates frameworks from Elon Musk's xAI to make these predictions understandable and actionable.

While Subsets doesn't currently utilize OpenAI's GPT.x models, the company is exploring the integration of downstream functionality using the same foundational model that powers ChatGPT.

Subsets' partnership with YC has opened doors to valuable connections and opportunities. YC's extensive network has facilitated collaborations with companies like the Athletic, a YC alum acquired by the New York Times.

With the support of Upfin, YC, and other investors, Subsets is poised to revolutionize the subscription industry by empowering businesses to retain subscribers and drive recurring revenue growth.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/alibaba-staff-offers-glimpse-into-life-of-llm-researcher-in-china/,Alibaba staffer offers a glimpse into building LLMs in China,"

In the realm of artificial intelligence, Chinese tech giants are locked in an intense race to catch up with the likes of OpenAI, the American company behind the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. Alibaba, a prominent player in this pursuit, offers a glimpse into the demanding lives of its researchers dedicated to developing Large Language Models (LLMs).

Binyuan Hui, a researcher at Alibaba's Qwen team, recently shared his daily routine on X, a Chinese social media platform. His schedule mirrors that of Jason Wei, an OpenAI researcher whose post went viral, revealing striking similarities in their workdays.

Both researchers wake up around 9 a.m. and work late into the night, often past 1 a.m. Their days are filled with meetings, coding, model training, and brainstorming sessions with colleagues. Even after returning home, they continue to experiment and ponder ways to enhance their models.

However, there are subtle differences in their leisure time choices. Hui spends his free time reading research papers and browsing X to stay updated on the latest developments in the field. Unlike Wei, who enjoys a glass of wine after work, Hui's post makes no mention of such indulgences.

This intense work ethic is not uncommon in China's LLM space, where top university graduates flock to tech companies to build competitive AI models. Hui's demanding schedule reflects a personal drive to match or even surpass Silicon Valley companies in the AI race.

The urgency of the task at hand is evident in the rapid rollout of LLMs by Chinese firms. Qwen, for instance, has open-sourced a series of foundation models trained with both English and Chinese data, with the largest model boasting 72 billion parameters. The team has also been quick to integrate these models into Alibaba's enterprise communication platform Dingtalk and online retailer Tmall.

While no clear leader has emerged in China's LLM space, Alibaba is carving out a niche with its focus on multilingual models. In December, the company released SeaLLM, an LLM capable of processing information in several Southeast Asian languages. This move could prove advantageous given Alibaba's strong presence in the region through its cloud computing business and acquisition of Lazada.

The race to develop LLMs in China is heating up, with tech companies investing heavily in resources and talent. The intense work ethic and dedication of researchers like Binyuan Hui underscore the urgency and ambition driving this pursuit.

This fund aims to empower startups in the Middle East, particularly in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan, by providing support from the early stages of development to the launch of their products.

Amir Farha, the founder and general partner of COTU Ventures, expressed his enthusiasm for the firm's focus on fintech and B2B software. However, he remains open to exploring opportunities across various sectors. Notable investments by COTU Ventures include Huspy, a UAE mortgage platform, and MoneyHash, an Egyptian fintech startup.

Farha, a seasoned venture capitalist with a proven track record, previously worked at BECO Capital, where he oversaw investments, strategy, and firm-building efforts. He recognized a market gap for early-stage support and launched COTU Ventures to address this need.

COTU Ventures distinguishes itself by fostering candid conversations with founders, delving into their personal and professional journeys to gain insights into their potential for success. This approach allows the firm to establish strong connections with founders and make informed investment decisions.

COTU Ventures offers comprehensive support to its portfolio companies, including strategic guidance on fundraising, organizational development, and go-to-market strategies. The firm also facilitates introductions to key stakeholders, such as customers, potential hires, and follow-on investors.

With a strong track record and a commitment to supporting founders, COTU Ventures has attracted a diverse group of limited partners, including Lunate, Mubadala, Dubai Future District Fund, Arab Bank, Bupa KSA, and several family offices.

Sharif Elbadawi, CEO of Dubai Future District Fund, expressed his confidence in COTU Ventures and its founding partner, Amir Farha. He praised Farha's passion for supporting founders and his ability to identify remarkable investment opportunities.

COTU Ventures is poised to make a significant impact on the Middle Eastern startup ecosystem by providing early-stage support, strategic guidance, and a network of connections to help startups thrive.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"

In the realm of social media, a pivotal moment looms on the horizon as the Supreme Court grapples with the fate of two state laws that seek to limit how social media companies moderate content on their platforms. These laws, one from Florida and the other from Texas, have ignited a fierce debate over the boundaries of free speech, government overreach, and the role of social media giants in shaping public discourse.

In a series of oral arguments, the justices delved into a complex web of legal questions that could potentially reshape the internet landscape. At the heart of the debate lies the tension between the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the need to address concerns about online misinformation, hate speech, and the spread of harmful content.

The Florida law, known as Senate Bill 7072, prohibits social media companies from banning political candidates or imposing restrictions on their content. The Texas law, House Bill 20, goes a step further, barring social media companies from removing or demonetizing content based on the viewpoint expressed by the user.

Supporters of these laws argue that they are necessary to prevent social media companies from censoring conservative viewpoints and stifling political debate. They contend that these companies have become too powerful and have abused their authority to silence dissenting voices.

Opponents of the laws, including the social media companies themselves, argue that they violate the First Amendment by compelling private companies to host content that they find objectionable. They also warn that such laws could have a chilling effect on free speech, as users may be less likely to express their views online for fear of being targeted by the government.

The Supreme Court justices grappled with these arguments, expressing skepticism about the overreach of the state laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor raised concerns about the broad nature of the laws, highlighting the potential for unintended consequences. She pointed out that the laws could potentially apply to a wide range of online platforms, including marketplaces like Etsy, which could be negatively impacted by restrictions on content moderation.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of the First Amendment's protection against government suppression of speech. He questioned whether content moderation was merely a euphemism for censorship, suggesting that the state laws could infringe on the free speech rights of social media companies.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, while expressing sympathy for concerns about the power of social media companies, also acknowledged the potential conflict with Section 230, a federal law that provides immunity to internet companies for content posted by users. He noted that Section 230 likely preempts the state laws' restrictions on social media moderation.

The outcome of these cases could have far-reaching implications for the future of content moderation on the internet. A ruling in favor of the state laws could significantly curtail the ability of social media companies to remove harmful content, potentially leading to an increase in misinformation and hate speech online. On the other hand, a ruling against the laws could reaffirm the First Amendment rights of social media companies and provide them with greater flexibility in moderating content.

The Supreme Court's decision is expected to be issued by the end of the court's term in June. However, the justices could also choose to decline to rule on the issues and send the cases back to lower courts for further proceedings. This would prolong the legal battle and leave the fate of content moderation in limbo for an extended period.

Regardless of the outcome, the Supreme Court's deliberations have brought into sharp focus the urgent need to update the legal framework governing the internet. The existing precedents, largely based on rulings predating the digital age, are ill-suited to address the unique challenges and complexities of online content moderation. As the internet continues to evolve and transform the way we communicate and consume information, the Supreme Court must grapple with these issues head-on and establish clear guidelines for the future of free speech and content moderation in the digital realm.

In the realm of storytelling, Inkitt, an innovative startup, has set its sights on revolutionizing the way we consume and engage with fictional narratives. Its mission? To create a 21st-century ""Disney"" by harnessing the power of AI to transform compelling stories into blockbusters.

Through its self-publishing platform, Inkitt empowers aspiring writers to share their tales. Using AI and data science, the platform identifies the most captivating stories, refines them, and presents them to readers on a dedicated app called Galatea. This approach has already garnered a remarkable 33 million users and produced numerous bestsellers.

Inkitt's vision extends beyond mere storytelling. It aims to establish a multimedia empire, encompassing games, audiobooks, and video content adapted from its vast library of fiction. The company's ultimate goal is to create a dynamic and immersive experience that captivates audiences across various mediums.

This ambitious endeavor has attracted significant funding, with the latest Series C round securing $37 million. Led by Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, the investment brings Inkitt's total funding to $117 million. The company's valuation currently stands at approximately $400 million post-money.

Inkitt's strategy stands in stark contrast to the prevailing trend of declining reading habits. In an era dominated by mobile devices and instant gratification, the average American adult now spends a mere 15 minutes per day reading. Inkitt, however, believes it can counter this trend by adapting its content to the digital age.

The company focuses on delivering books in innovative ways, creating shorter chapters optimized for mobile devices and incorporating interactive elements to enhance the reading experience. Additionally, Inkitt leverages data analysis to tailor stories to readers' preferences, conducting A/B tests on various aspects of the narrative to identify what resonates best with audiences.

This data-driven approach has proven successful. While many services that thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic have since seen a decline, Inkitt, Galatea, and Galatea TV have all experienced a surge in engagement. The company attributes this success to the escapism and entertainment that its stories provide in a world filled with distractions.

Inkitt's achievements are not limited to reader engagement. It claims to rank as the 11th best-selling publisher globally, surpassing established names like Penguin Random House. This remarkable success, according to Inkitt, stems from its algorithms, which it believes yield a 20x higher chance of publishing a bestseller compared to traditional publishers.

The company's focus on undiscovered talent sets it apart from traditional publishing houses. Inkitt seeks to nurture and promote emerging writers, avoiding the challenges and egos often associated with established authors. This approach has yielded substantial financial rewards, with revenues doubling in the past year.

Inkitt's journey into the realm of AI-generated content is particularly intriguing. The company envisions a future where AI plays a significant role in crafting stories and personalizing them for individual readers. This vision is supported by collaborations with leading LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI.

Inkitt's commitment to IP protection is evident in its cautious approach to using LLMs. The company employs a mix of different LLMs and intentionally provides flat prompts to avoid inadvertently teaching them too much about its best-performing content.

Inkitt's mission has resonated with investors, particularly Vinod Khosla, who believes that the future of entertainment lies in hyper-personalized experiences. Inkitt's ability to create content that is tailored to individual preferences aligns perfectly with this vision.

As Inkitt continues to navigate the ever-changing landscape of storytelling, its dedication to innovation and its focus on creating immersive experiences position it as a formidable player in the entertainment industry. The company's journey towards building a 21st-century ""Disney"" is one to watch, as it has the potential to redefine the way we consume and engage with stories.

The Ring Car Cam: A Tale of Identity Crisis and Discontinuation

In the realm of gadgets, the Ring Car Cam stands out as a device that struggled to find its true purpose. Launched with great fanfare, it promised to be a revolutionary sentinel on wheels, extending the home security ecosystem into the automotive space. However, as time passed, the question of its target audience lingered like an unresolved enigma.

Was it meant for the security-conscious homeowner, the tech-savvy car enthusiast, or a broader demographic altogether? This ambiguity proved to be a significant hurdle, preventing the Ring Car Cam from gaining a solid foothold in any market segment.

Adding to its woes was the hefty price tag of $199, coupled with a mandatory $6 monthly subscription to maintain its ""connected"" status. In comparison, other dashcams offered similar or even superior features at a fraction of the cost.

While the Ring Car Cam boasted innovative features like OBD-II port connectivity and a ""traffic stop"" mode activated by voice command, these were not enough to sway consumers who were already accustomed to USB-powered dashcams with continuous recording capabilities.

Ultimately, the Ring Car Cam's discontinuation serves as a reminder that even the most well-intentioned products can falter when they fail to clearly define their target audience and offer compelling value.

The demise of the Ring Car Cam also prompts a broader reflection on consumer expectations regarding dashcams and automotive security devices. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, drivers are becoming accustomed to having constant video coverage of their vehicles.

Tesla's Sentry Mode, for instance, offers remote access and video recording capabilities, but its integration with the Ring Car Connect product never materialized beyond the initial announcement. This lack of traction suggests that consumers may not be as eager to entrust the safety of their vehicles solely to a single device or ecosystem.

The discontinuation of the Ring Car Cam serves as a stark reminder that in the competitive world of gadgets, finding a clear purpose and delivering tangible value are paramount to success.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ring-Car-Cam.jpeg?w=1185,2024-02-26 23:29:25
https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/reddit-users-wonder-if-the-next-big-meme-stock-is-reddit-itself/,"Reddit IPO could usher in the next big meme stock, users speculate","

In a groundbreaking move, Reddit is inviting its devoted users to invest in its upcoming IPO, offering them a chance to become stakeholders in the platform that has become an integral part of their digital lives. This exclusive opportunity is extended to power users who have significantly contributed to Reddit's vibrant community.

The company's decision to include its users in the IPO process is a testament to the immense value they bring to the platform. Reddit's success is largely attributed to the efforts of its passionate moderators and content creators, who tirelessly curate and shape the platform's diverse communities.

However, the potential for Reddit to become the next ""meme stock"" is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it could lead to significant financial gains for early investors. On the other hand, it could also result in unpredictable stock price fluctuations and potential losses.

The rise of meme stocks, such as GameStop and AMC, has demonstrated the immense power of online communities to influence the stock market. Reddit, with its massive user base and influential communities like r/WallStreetBets, has the potential to replicate this phenomenon.

The company's decision to list r/WallStreetBets as a risk factor in its S-1 filing highlights the potential impact of these communities on the stock market. The subreddit's coordinated short squeeze on GameStop stock in 2021 sent shockwaves through the financial world, costing hedge funds billions of dollars.

While the potential for Reddit to become a meme stock is intriguing, it's essential to remember that investing in any stock carries inherent risks. Reddit's profitability remains uncertain, and the company faces stiff competition from established social media giants.

Moreover, the company's relationship with its power users has been strained in recent times due to controversial API changes that affected third-party apps. This has led to concerns about Reddit's commitment to its community.

Despite these challenges, Reddit's potential as a search engine is undeniable. Its vast repository of user-generated content and its active community make it a valuable resource for information seekers.

The company's partnership with Google, which will pay $60 million annually to use Reddit's content to train its large language models, further underscores the platform's potential.

Whether Reddit will ultimately succeed as a publicly traded company remains to be seen. However, the company's decision to involve its users in the IPO process is a bold move that could redefine the relationship between social media platforms and their communities.

Qatar Unveils $1 Billion Venture Capital Fund to Boost Tech Innovation

In a bold move to bolster its tech ecosystem, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has announced the launch of a $1 billion venture capital fund of funds. This initiative aims to attract international VC funds and startups to Qatar and the wider Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, with a focus on fintech, edtech, and healthcare sectors.

QIA's fund-of-funds structure will invest indirectly through other VC funds, while also making targeted co-investments. This strategy is designed to increase the number of startups and enhance VC funding availability in Qatar, aiming to bridge the gap with neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Gulf sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have collectively invested over $73 billion across various asset classes in 2022, with a growing emphasis on tech startups in the GCC region. This trend reflects their efforts to diversify economies and reduce reliance on oil.

Saudi Arabia has taken the lead in establishing dedicated funds for tech firms, with initiatives like Jada and Saudi Venture Capital actively investing in venture capital funds. QIA's fund of funds, however, is unique in its exclusive focus on venture capital funds, making it the first of its kind in the region.

QIA CEO Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud emphasized the importance of this program in supporting innovative businesses and diversifying Qatar's economy. He stressed the need for a well-connected startup ecosystem to attract international VC funds and startups to Qatar.

Fund managers seeking funds from QIA must demonstrate a strong track record and actively participate in the Gulf's VC and startup ecosystem. This includes establishing operations, a senior-level presence in Qatar, and outlining expansion plans across the GCC.

QIA's initiative aligns with the growing interest among fund managers and venture capitalists in raising capital from limited partners in the Middle East, including sovereign wealth funds. It will be intriguing to observe how these directives align with their individual investments.

Historically, Gulf SWFs have invested in foreign startups, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, with limited connections to the Gulf region. QIA, for example, has made notable investments in companies like Builder.ai, Reliance Retail, Insider, Airtel Africa, Swiggy, and Flipkart.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/lockbit-ransomware-takedown-now-what/,"Feds hack LockBit, LockBit springs back. Now what?","

In the realm of cybercrime, the notorious LockBit ransomware gang, hailing from Russia, made a bold comeback after a brief hiatus. Despite a sweeping law enforcement operation that aimed to dismantle their infrastructure, LockBit resurfaced with a new leak site, ready to target unsuspecting victims.

The gang's administrator, in a lengthy and somewhat rambling statement, blamed their own negligence for the disruption caused by the authorities. The global law enforcement effort, dubbed ""Operation Cronos,"" successfully infiltrated and seized control of LockBit's systems, including their dark web leak site.

The operation resulted in the takedown of servers across multiple countries, the seizure of cryptocurrency wallets, and the arrest of alleged LockBit members. However, just days later, LockBit announced its return, claiming to have restored its operations from unaffected backups.

The NCA, which led Operation Cronos, expressed confidence in their actions, stating that they had compromised LockBit's entire criminal operation and destroyed their systems. However, the gang's brazen relaunch and continued threats of retaliation against the government sector paint a different picture.

The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and cybercriminals continues, with both sides making bold claims. The NCA promised to reveal the identity of LockBit's elusive leader, known as ""LockBitSupp,"" but details remain scarce. U.S. law enforcement agencies have offered a multimillion-dollar reward for information leading to the identification of key LockBit leaders.

The apparent survival of LockBitSupp suggests that the gang's demise may have been exaggerated. Ransomware gangs are known for their resilience, often regrouping and rebranding after law enforcement disruptions. Similar incidents involving other ransomware gangs like ALPHV and Hive have shown that these groups can quickly adapt and continue their malicious activities.

LockBit's lengthy statement claimed that law enforcement only obtained a limited number of decryptors, arrested the wrong individuals, and failed to take down all of their websites. The gang vowed to upgrade its security, manually release decryptors, and maintain its affiliate program.

While law enforcement acknowledges the possibility of LockBit regrouping, they continue their efforts to disrupt the gang's operations. The NCA spokesperson, Richard Crowe, emphasized the intelligence gathered during the operation and their ongoing work to target and disrupt LockBit.

The resurgence of LockBit serves as a reminder that the battle against cybercrime is far from over. Law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts must remain vigilant in their efforts to combat these threats and protect individuals and organizations from malicious actors.

Women in Tech: Breaking Barriers and Fostering Inclusion

In the realm of technology, the gender gap remains a persistent issue, with women facing numerous challenges in their pursuit of leadership roles. This disparity is not merely a cultural phenomenon but a global concern, demanding attention and action.

My journey in tech began in 1999, navigating a predominantly male-dominated landscape. As I progressed through the ranks, I encountered obstacles and biases that tested my resilience. From being bullied by male colleagues to witnessing the negative impact of maternity leave on women's careers, the challenges were undeniable.

These experiences fueled my determination to shed light on the plight of women in tech and advocate for change. The challenges they face can be attributed to a lack of mentorship, workplace culture, biases, system barriers, and societal factors.

Breaking Down the Barriers

To address the gender gap in tech, concerted efforts are required from various stakeholders. Companies must prioritize mentorship programs that empower young female professionals with guidance and support. Mentorship can bridge the gap and encourage gender diversity, fostering a sense of direction and enhancing productivity.

Moreover, companies need to establish structures that promote work-life balance, recognizing the unique responsibilities women often shoulder. Empathy and understanding for nursing mothers are crucial, ensuring that maternity leave does not negatively impact their career progression.

Furthermore, adequate compensation should be provided equally, irrespective of gender. Boardrooms should reflect a diverse representation, with women having equal access and opportunities. Merit-based criteria should govern boardroom positions, rather than gender-based biases.

Government and Societal Roles

Government policies can play a significant role in encouraging women's representation, especially in leadership positions. Regulatory bodies must enforce balanced gender workforces, ensuring equal rights and remunerations.

Countries with cultures that discourage women from pursuing careers should recognize the immense contributions women make to society and adopt gender-inclusive workforce policies. Education and mentorship should begin early, empowering girls to pursue their passions in STEM fields and technology.

The Power of Women in Tech

The inclusion of women in tech is not just a matter of fairness; it's a strategic imperative. Studies have shown that companies with diverse leadership teams perform better, benefiting from the unique perspectives and skills that women bring to the table.

As an enabler for any business, technology thrives on innovation and creativity. The more women involved in shaping the future of tech, the more diverse and groundbreaking the solutions will be.

The journey towards gender equality in tech is an ongoing one, requiring unwavering commitment from individuals, organizations, and governments. By breaking down barriers, fostering inclusion, and recognizing the immense value of women's contributions, we can create a future where technology truly reflects the diversity of the world we live in.

Have you ever felt like a fish out of water when tasked with a home repair project? I did when I tried to fix a piece of furniture, only to realize I lacked the necessary tools and skills. This experience taught me the importance of having the right tools for the job.

The same principle applies to cybersecurity. As new cyber threats emerge, it's crucial to have the appropriate defenses in place. However, building a new security apparatus for every new attack is impractical. Instead, security platforms need to be flexible and adaptable, allowing them to adjust to new attack vectors with existing tools.

Take the recent surge in QR code-based phishing attacks as an example. These attacks increased by 587% in just a few months. QR code phishing attacks work like traditional phishing attacks, with threat actors creating malicious QR codes that redirect users to credential-harvesting websites.

The success of these attacks can be attributed to several factors. First, security solutions traditionally had difficulty parsing QR codes to find the malicious link behind the image. Second, users are accustomed to scanning QR codes, making them more susceptible to these attacks. Third, while these attacks existed, they weren't common enough to warrant full-fledged protection.

As a result, when QR code attacks became mainstream, many organizations found themselves vulnerable. However, the infrastructure to detect and block such attacks already existed. The key was to understand the full capabilities of security solutions and adapt them to provide comprehensive protection.

For instance, optical character recognition (OCR), commonly used to combat scanned document attacks, can be easily adapted to QR codes. OCR can identify QR codes, convert them into URLs, and then run them through standard click-time protection and emulation services. Additionally, the link can be rewritten to further examine it when users click on it.

The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, with new attacks emerging all the time. It's impossible to build a new security solution from scratch every time there's a new threat. Instead, organizations need to have a comprehensive set of tools that can work together to combat these attacks. The challenge then becomes identifying the best tool for the job, rather than starting from scratch.

In the case of QR codes, the solution involved OCR and URL wrapping. While we don't know what hackers will use next, the question shouldn't be how to address it in the next security update. Instead, organizations should ask themselves, ""What tools do we already have that can be deployed today to prevent these attacks?""

By having the right tools and adapting them to new threats, organizations can stay ahead of the curve and protect themselves from emerging cyber threats.

iPhone 17: A Glimpse into the Future of Refreshing Displays

Apple's iPhone 15 and 15 Plus boast stunning displays that deliver pin-sharp visuals, blur-free animations, and accurate colors. However, their 60Hz refresh rate falls short compared to many competitors, including Apple's own iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. This disparity is set to change, but with a catch: you'll have to wait until 2025.

The 60Hz refresh rate on non-Pro iPhones has been a point of contention among users, especially considering that many rival phones, even those at lower price points, have adopted faster refresh rates. Apple, however, has reserved its ProMotion screens exclusively for the Pro iPhone models.

According to a recent report by The Elec, spotted by MacRumors, Apple plans to continue using 60Hz displays with Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon technology in the upcoming iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, slated for release this fall. However, the iPhone 17 series will reportedly make the switch to Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide panels across the board.

You may wonder why this matters if the current 60Hz displays are already impressive. While general refresh rates may not be a noticeable difference for most users, Apple's ProMotion displays offer an additional benefit: the Always-On feature.

The Always-On display on the iPhone 15 Pro, for example, allows you to view the time, date, widgets, and a subtle version of your lock screen wallpaper without having to tap the phone. This convenience eliminates the need to constantly wake the screen just to check the time.

The ProMotion technology enables this feature by dynamically adjusting the refresh rate. It can ramp up to a smooth 120Hz for scrolling and video playback, while dropping down to a power-saving 1Hz for static content.

Furthermore, iOS 17 introduces a handy feature called StandBy. When your iPhone is charging and placed on its side, such as on a compatible wireless charger, the display can come to life, showing the time, calendar, photos, and widgets. The screen remains active for a short while, but you can tap it or nudge the table to wake it up again.

However, this Always-On display experience is exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro, Pro Max, and iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. Regular iPhones, with their 60Hz displays, miss out on this convenience.

The wait for a truly immersive display experience on non-Pro iPhones will soon be over, as Apple plans to bring 120Hz ProMotion displays to the entire iPhone lineup in 2025. This upgrade will not only enhance the overall user experience but also bring feature parity between the Pro and non-Pro models.

The Resilience of Brick-and-Mortar Auto Dealerships in a Digital Age

In a world increasingly dominated by online shopping, one industry that has defied expectations is the traditional brick-and-mortar auto dealership. Despite predictions that the ability to buy and finance vehicles online would render physical dealerships obsolete, a new study reveals that their numbers have not only remained stable but have even witnessed a slight increase.

The 2023 year-end Automotive Franchise Activity Report (FAR) by automotive consultants Urban Science found that the number of physical dealerships in the United States actually grew by 90 in 2023, from 18,257 to 18,347. This modest increase may seem insignificant, but it's worth noting that it occurred amidst significant challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the semiconductor chip shortage.

While the number of dealerships grew, the number of franchises, or brands offered by those dealerships, decreased slightly from 31,554 in 2022 to 30,504 in 2023. This consolidation, however, does not necessarily indicate a decline in consumer choice. As Mitch Phillips, director of global data at Urban Science, explains, ""It's about the same number than it was 14 years ago. As far as the choice for the consumer, we've maybe consolidated some in one store and maybe they expand at times, but the consumer choice is still there.""

Perhaps the most remarkable finding of the study is the increase in the number of vehicles sold by each dealership, a metric known as throughput. Despite the challenges of the past few years, throughput has shown a steady upward trend, rising from 807 vehicles per year in 2020 to 851 vehicles per year in 2023. This resilience is a testament to the adaptability of auto dealers, who have embraced digital tools and adapted their operations to meet the changing needs of consumers.

However, increased volume does not necessarily translate to increased profits. A recent report by J.D. Power indicates that total retailer profit per unit has declined significantly in recent months due to rising inventory and fewer vehicles selling above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). This underscores the need for dealers to continue adapting and innovating to remain profitable in a rapidly evolving market.

One of the significant changes that dealers are facing is the transition to electrified vehicles. Urban Science cautions dealers to be strategic in analyzing sales data trends before making major investments in EV infrastructure and inventory. However, Phillips emphasizes that dealers need to be prepared to sell and service these vehicles as they become more prevalent in the market.

Despite the challenges and uncertainties, the future of brick-and-mortar auto dealerships appears to be secure. Millennials, who are now the largest generation of car buyers, continue to prefer the traditional dealership experience, valuing the ability to see, touch, and test drive vehicles before making a purchase. This preference, coupled with the adaptability and resilience of auto dealers, suggests that physical dealerships will remain a vital part of the automotive landscape for years to come.

Samsung Unveils Industry's First 12-Stack HBM3E DRAM: A Revolutionary Leap in Memory Technology

In a groundbreaking achievement, Samsung Electronics has unveiled the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E DRAM, pushing the boundaries of high bandwidth memory with exceptional capacity. This cutting-edge technology marks a significant milestone in the evolution of memory solutions.

The HBM3E 12H DRAM boasts an impressive maximum bandwidth of 1,280GB/s and a remarkable capacity of 36GB, representing a substantial 50% increase in both bandwidth and capacity compared to its 8-stack HBM3 predecessor. This remarkable feat is achieved through the innovative stacking of multiple DRAM modules vertically, with each module boasting a capacity of 24 gigabits (Gb) or 3 gigabytes (GB).

Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, the leading players in the memory industry, are engaged in a fierce competition to stack more DRAM modules while maintaining a compact form factor. The goal is to create chips that are as thin as possible while maximizing capacity.

This year, all three companies aim to ramp up their production of HBM, driven by the resurgence of the memory chip market and the soaring demand for AI applications. The popularity of AI has fueled the demand for GPUs, particularly those manufactured by Nvidia, which are often paired with HBM memory.

To meet the stringent package requirements, Samsung employed an advanced thermal compression non-conductive film (TC NCF) in the 12-stack HBM3E. This innovative film is thinner than previous iterations and eliminates voids between the stacks, reducing the gap to a mere seven micrometers. This ingenious design enables the 12-stack HBM3E to achieve a vertical density that surpasses the 8-stack HBM3 by over 20%.

The TC NCF also facilitates the use of small and large bumps during chip bonding. Small bumps are strategically placed in areas designated for signaling, while larger bumps are utilized in locations requiring heat dissipation.

Samsung's HBM3E 12H DRAM promises to revolutionize data centers by reducing the total cost of ownership. For AI applications, this groundbreaking technology can accelerate AI training speeds by an impressive 34% and simultaneously accommodate 11.5 times more users for inference services compared to the HBM3 8H.

Humane Ai Pin: A Hands-On Experience from the Mobile World Congress

The Humane Ai Pin, a pioneering AI-powered wearable, has made waves in the tech industry for its innovative approach to digital assistance. Its presence at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona sparked curiosity and raised questions about its potential impact on the future of human-computer interaction.

Unlike traditional booths, Humane opted for a unique strategy, scattering its team of engineers and designers across the event to showcase the Ai Pin within partnering companies' spaces. This unconventional approach allowed for intimate demonstrations and comparisons with other AI devices, creating a sense of friendly competition.

At the T-Mobile booth, the Ai Pin's sleek white case and black Humane hoodie caught my attention amidst the vibrant magenta walls. Having followed the brand's journey for some time, I was eager to experience its debut consumer product firsthand.

The demo began with basic voice commands. A simple query about the number of attendees at the Mobile World Congress was met with a prompt and accurate response, thanks to the Pin's Bluetooth connection to a mini speaker hidden beneath the hoodie. For more complex questions requiring research, the Pin provided a reassuring ""Searching for attendees"" message as it scoured the web.

The Pin's quick response times and consistent performance impressed me. It offered a seamless way to fact-check information while on the go, without the hassle of pulling out a smartphone. However, the need for an external speaker raised questions about the volume of the Pin's built-in audio.

The true showstopper of the Pin is its Laser Ink Display, which projects information onto the user's raised palm. This futuristic feature adds a touch of sci-fi flair while offering practical benefits. When asking embarrassing questions, for instance, the projected answers provide a discreet solution.

The 3D sensor and mapping of the digital interface worked flawlessly, keeping the projection centered despite hand movements. Pinch and leaning gestures caused slight distortions but never compromised readability.

While the live demos showcased the Pin's potential, questions remain about its integration with smartphones and the value proposition of its $699 price tag and $24 monthly subscription. However, the seamless interactions with an ever-present AI companion hold immense promise, especially in situations where context is crucial.

Queries like currency conversions, directions, and nearby amenities can be answered swiftly without the need to fumble with a smartphone. In this regard, the Humane Ai Pin offers a compelling vision for the future of AI-powered assistance.
