Tesla's Plan for a Lower-Cost EV Cancelled in Favor of a Robotaxi

In a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk has decided to abandon Tesla's plans for a lower-cost electric vehicle (EV) that was supposed to cost around $25,000, according to a report by Reuters. Instead, the company will focus its efforts on a planned robotaxi that will be built on the same small EV platform as the abandoned car.

Musk has a history of wavering on whether to prioritize a traditional car or one with no steering wheel or pedals. Despite announcing plans for a truly low-cost Tesla in 2020, Musk had stopped work on the car by early 2022. But the project was spun back up again, and the CEO and his engineers were divided on whether it should be a traditional car or a futuristic robotaxi.

In Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Musk, he described the CEO pushing back against his engineers' insistence on referencing a car with a steering wheel and pedals. ""This vehicle must be designed as a clean robotaxi,"" Isaacson quoted Musk as saying. ""We're going to take that risk, it's my fault if it fucks up."" A few weeks later, Isaacson said, he quoted Musk saying the robotaxi will ""transform everything"" and make Tesla a ""ten-trillion [dollar] company.""

However, despite his initial enthusiasm for the project, Musk still considered the $25,000 car to be ""really not that exciting of a project"" - despite it being the ultimate goal of his famed original ""master plan"" for Tesla. But by early 2023, Musk had agreed to move forward with the plan laid out by his lieutenants, and the project was set to be built in Texas.

Now, according to Reuters, work has stopped on the traditional car project in favor of the robotaxi approach. This news has raised questions about Tesla's plans for future vehicles, and whether the company will continue to prioritize the development of a lower-cost EV.

Tesla has been working on the robotaxi and the traditional car for a few years, and Isaacson's biography provides insight into the internal debates and discussions that have taken place within the company. He writes that lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy kept the more traditional car version alive as a ""shadow project"" and made a pitch to Musk in September 2022, arguing that they needed an inexpensive, small car in order to grow at Musk's stated goal of 50% per year. They also laid out the plan to use the same platform to power both distinct models.

Despite the challenges and setbacks, Musk's vision for Tesla remains ambitious, and the company continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of EVs and autonomous vehicles. As the company moves forward, it will be interesting to see how it balances its pursuit of innovation with the need to remain profitable and competitive in the marketplace.

Queerie, a dating app designed specifically for the LGBTQIA+ community, is on a mission to address a significant issue - isolation and mental health challenges prevalent in queer spaces. While the problem is grave and the intention admirable, the company's pitch deck reveals areas that require improvement to increase its fundability.

An Invigorating Pitch Deck

Upon first glance, Queerie's pitch deck feels modern, engaging, and unique, making a strong first impression. The company has smartly chosen to lead with its mission, followed by the problem it aims to solve. This storytelling technique is both powerful and effective in attracting mission-aligned investors.

Identifying a Pressing Problem

Queerie's problem slide addresses a concerning reality in many queer communities - the presence of isolation and mental health challenges. By positioning itself as a solution for loneliness, the app distinguishes itself from other dating platforms. Although the effectiveness of this approach remains to be seen, the problem addressed is indeed worth tackling.

Opportunities for Improvement

Despite the promising concept, there are several areas where Queerie could strengthen its pitch:

1. Diversifying the team: The team behind Queerie appears to lack diversity, especially in terms of gender representation. For an app designed to be an ""inclusivity-designed platform,"" this could be perceived as a shortcoming.
2. Balancing experience: While the team boasts impressive credentials, there seems to be a lack of startup experience and sales & marketing expertise. Adding a seasoned marketeer with consumer marketing app experience could help make the team more believable and well-rounded.
3. Showcasing innovation: The slide describing the app is unremarkable and doesn't highlight any unique selling points. It is crucial to emphasize what makes Queerie stand out from its competitors to pique investors' interest.
4. Demonstrating traction: Instead of focusing on the number of beta testers, Queerie should provide data on user interaction, such as DAU/MAU stats and user feedback, to show real traction.

Introduction

The FDA approved Rejoyn, the first prescription-only app for depression, developed by Click Therapeutics and Otsuka Pharmaceutical. This app, targeting major depressive disorder, complements supervised care and medication.

How Rejoyn Differs

Unlike other therapy apps, Rejoyn requires a prescription and utilizes brain-training exercises to improve communication between brain areas related to emotion regulation.

Clinical Trials and Effectiveness

Rejoyn's 13-week study of 386 participants showed improvement in baseline depression symptoms, with continued progress a month after treatment and no reported side effects.

Depression rates are increasing among US adults, with 8.5% reporting symptoms in 2020. Rejoyn offers a new approach to treating depression, harnessing technology and neuroplasticity.","Title: Prescription Digital Therapeutics: A New Frontier in Depression Treatment

Introduction

The world of mental health therapy and wellness apps is bustling with options, but many of these tools only offer minimal or self-regulated assistance. They cannot replace professional mental health care or treat disorders due to the lack of clinical trials and regulation. However, a recent development in prescription digital treatments, such as the FDA-approved Rejoyn app, is set to change the landscape of mental health care, particularly for those struggling with major depressive disorder.

The Dawn of Prescription Digital Treatments

Earlier this week, the FDA approved Rejoyn, a smartphone app designed to alleviate symptoms associated with major depressive disorder. Developed by Click Therapeutics and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Rejoyn is the first digital therapeutic for depression to receive the green light from the regulator. This app is intended to complement supervised care for adults aged 22 and older who have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and are taking antidepressant medication.

Differentiating Rejoyn from Traditional Therapy Apps

Unlike popular therapy apps like BetterHelp and Talkspace, which can be easily downloaded from the App Store, Rejoyn requires a prescription from a healthcare provider for access. Oral depression medications typically target neurochemical imbalances, but depression can also be influenced by miscommunication between brain areas responsible for emotion recognition and regulation.

Rejoyn's Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT), a six-week program developed by neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, taps into the brain's neuroplasticity to improve communication between these areas. EFMT consists of brain-training exercises that target neural regions affected by depression, creating stronger and more balanced connections.

Clinical Trials and Effectiveness

The FDA cleared Rejoyn based on a 13-week study of 386 participants aged 22 to 64, who showed improvement in their baseline depression symptoms compared to a sham app. Furthermore, trial results demonstrated continued improvement a month after treatment, with no reported side effects.

Introduction

In a remarkable breakthrough, researchers from Nagoya University's Graduate School of Informatics have developed a framework that enables large-scale language models (LLMs) to evolve diverse personality traits in dialogue AI. This novel approach allows AI agents to interact and adapt their strategies through evolutionary processes, ultimately mimicking human behavior by switching between selfish and cooperative actions. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, provide valuable insights into the future of AI and its role in society.

The Nagoya University team, led by Professor Takaya Arita and Associate Professor Reiji Suzuki, utilized the prisoner's dilemma from game theory to create AI agents with distinct personalities. These agents were then set loose in a virtual environment, where they interacted and evolved based on natural language descriptions of personality traits encoded in their genes.

The Evolution of AI Personalities

In traditional evolutionary game theory models, genes directly determine an agent's behavior. However, Arita and Suzuki explored a more complex approach by encoding genes representing nuanced descriptions, such as ""being open to team efforts while prioritizing self-interest, leading to a combination of cooperation and defection."" The LLM then translated these descriptions into behavioral strategies, asking whether it would cooperate or defect under specific circumstances.

The researchers observed a wide range of personality traits emerging in the AI agents, with some displaying selfish characteristics and others demonstrating advanced strategies centered around personal gain and mutual benefit. The evolutionary framework, which shaped the agents' abilities through natural selection and mutation over generations, allowed for this rich tapestry of personality traits.

Human Societal Dynamics in AI Populations

The experiments conducted by the team provided fascinating insights into the evolutionary dynamics of personality traits in AI agents. They observed the emergence of both cooperative and selfish personality traits within AI populations, reminiscent of human societal dynamics.

However, they also uncovered the inherent instability in AI societies. Excessively cooperative groups were often replaced by more 'egocentric' agents, revealing the delicate balance between cooperation and selfishness in AI populations.

Introduction

Imagine a world where monitoring your health is as simple as using a home appliance. This vision could soon become a reality, thanks to the groundbreaking work of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They've developed a miniature ionizer, a crucial component of a mass spectrometer, which could pave the way for affordable, in-home health monitoring devices. Let's delve into the details of this innovative invention and explore its potential impact on chronic disease management.

The Power of Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is a technique used to identify and measure the chemical components of a sample with high precision. This technology can be instrumental in monitoring the health of individuals with chronic illnesses, such as measuring hormone levels in the blood of someone with hypothyroidism. However, mass spectrometers are typically expensive and confined to laboratory settings, making the process of health monitoring cumbersome and inefficient.

In the ever-evolving world of robotics, researchers are constantly pushing the boundaries to create more autonomous and efficient machines. A significant challenge in this field is navigating robots through complex, occlusion-prone environments. A group of researchers from the University of Hong Kong has recently developed a groundbreaking framework, AGRNav, to enhance the autonomous navigation of air-ground robots in such settings.

Traditional robotic systems have been predominantly deployed in controlled indoor environments, such as warehouses, airports, and offices. However, there is a growing need for these machines to operate in unknown and unmapped outdoor settings, where obstacles can easily obstruct their sensors, increasing the risk of collisions. Air-ground robots, in particular, have the potential to revolutionize various applications, from search and rescue operations in disaster-stricken areas to package delivery in remote locations and environmental monitoring.

The primary hurdle in navigating air-ground robots through outdoor environments is the presence of occlusions, which can lead to suboptimal trajectories, higher collision probabilities, and increased energy consumption. To tackle this issue, the research team introduced AGRNav, a novel framework comprising two main components: a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) and a hierarchical path planner.

SCONet predicts the distribution of obstacles and their semantic features using a deep learning approach, which requires minimal computational power. The hierarchical path planner, on the other hand, utilizes the predictions made by SCONet to generate optimal, energy-efficient aerial and ground paths for the robot to reach a specific location.

The researchers evaluated AGRNav in both simulations and real-world experiments, using a customized air-ground robot. The results demonstrated that AGRNav outperformed all other baseline and state-of-the-art robot navigation frameworks, efficiently identifying optimal and energy-saving paths for the robot.

The implications of this research are far-reaching, as AGRNav's underlying code is open-source and accessible to developers worldwide. The framework could be deployed and tested on various air-ground robotic platforms, paving the way for their effective deployment in real-world environments.

3D Magnetic Recording Boosts Hard Drive Capacity: A Breakthrough ","Title: A Revolutionary Three-Dimensional Approach to Magnetic Recording in Hard Disk Drives

In a groundbreaking development for the world of data storage, a team of researchers from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University have successfully demonstrated the potential of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium. This pioneering technology promises to significantly increase the storage capacity of hard disk drives (HDDs), paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective solutions in the near future.

Presently, data centers store massive quantities of information on HDDs equipped with perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology, which can accommodate areal densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/in2. However, in order to transition to higher densities, a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium incorporating FePt grains and heat-assisted laser writing is necessary. This method, known as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), can sustain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/in2, with the potential for even greater densities exceeding 10 Tbit/in2 based on a new principle that involves storing multiple recording levels of 3 or 4, as opposed to the binary level used in conventional HDD technology.

In their study, published in Acta Materialia, the team managed to arrange the FePt recording layers three-dimensionally by fabricating lattice-matched, FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer films, with Ru acting as a spacer layer. Measurements of the magnetization revealed that the two FePt layers possess different Curie temperatures, enabling three-dimensional recording by adjusting the laser power during the writing process.

To further illustrate the principle of 3D recording, the researchers conducted recording simulations using a media model that mimics the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media. This innovative technique has the potential to increase recording capacity by stacking recording layers in three dimensions, allowing for the storage of more digital information using fewer HDDs, and ultimately resulting in energy savings for data centers.

The team's future plans involve developing processes to reduce the size of FePt grains, enhance orientation and magnetic anisotropy, and stack additional FePt layers to create a media structure suitable for practical use in high-density HDDs.

Snapchat adjusts ""Solar System"" ranking after anxiety reports; now optional for subscribers.","Title: Snapchat Adjusts ""Solar System"" Feature in Response to User Anxiety

In an effort to address user concerns, Snapchat recently modified its ""Solar System"" feature within the popular messaging app. This adjustment comes just days after The Wall Street Journal reported that the feature was contributing to increased anxiety among teenagers. The revised feature, which remains an option for Snapchat+ subscribers, no longer appears by default for users.

The ""Solar System"" ranks a user's friends based on their level of engagement, positioning them in various planetary orbits. This ranking system can have unintended consequences, sometimes leading to hurt feelings when users realize they aren't as close to their friends as they thought. Recognizing this issue, Snapchat has taken action to alleviate such negative feelings.

In a statement released on their newsroom, Snap, the company behind Snapchat, acknowledged feedback indicating that while it can be nice to know you're close to someone, it can also be disheartening to learn that you're not as close as you would like to be. Snapchat aims to avoid causing distress with features like ""Solar System.""

Rather than removing the feature entirely, Snapchat has opted to turn it off by default for subscribers while allowing them to enable it if they so choose. The company believes that this approach strikes an appropriate balance, providing a desired feature for those who want it while avoiding upsetting those who do not.

However, some argue that turning off the feature by default might not be enough to deter curious teenagers. Snapchat+ users may seek out the option and re-enable it, as the feature has reportedly gained popularity among this demographic.

Snapchat asserts that only a small percentage of its user base (less than 0.25%) actively uses the ""Solar System"" option. Yet, considering the feature is exclusive to paid subscribers, a more relevant statistic would be the proportion of Snapchat+ users who have engaged with the feature.

Introduction

The Gulf Coast of the United States is no stranger to tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. Climate change and global warming are expected to increase the likelihood of these occurrences, which could significantly impact the region's activities. A recent study by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany focused on the Texas power grid, aiming to identify critical lines that should be reinforced to prevent severe outages in the future. This paper, published in Nature Energy, provides valuable insights for local government and engineers working to increase the grid's resilience in Texas.

The Impact of Extreme Weather Events on the Texas Power Grid

Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tropical cyclones, can cause extensive damage to transmission lines and towers, often leading to widespread blackouts and power outages. These events can have a significant impact on the power grid, causing tens or even hundreds of transmission lines and towers to fail. The N-1 and N-2 security rules, which require the power grid to remain resilient even after one or two components fail, are often insufficient in the face of severe weather events.

Identifying Critical Lines for Grid Resilience

Mehrnaz Anvari, the author who coordinated the research, emphasized the importance of understanding the interplay between evolving storm conditions and the partially destroyed state of the grid. The researchers focused on identifying the ""backbone"" of the grid, which supports its resilience, by examining the impact of critical lines on the overall system.

The researchers' approach differs from previous efforts in this field by considering the impact of critical lines in instances where the power grid has already suffered extensive damages. By doing so, they were able to determine the lines whose failure during a hurricane is most likely to trigger large-scale blackouts.

The primary objective of the study was to understand the temporal-spatial structure of damages and outages, a topic with little preexisting research. The researchers based their approach on the intuition that if a complex but robust system fails due to external stresses, it typically does so following fairly well-defined patterns or failure modes.
