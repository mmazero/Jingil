Truecaller's Call Recording Feature: A Closer Look

Truecaller, a renowned caller identity service, has introduced a new feature for its premium users in India, the company's largest market. This feature allows users to record and transcribe calls, making it easier to capture important conversations and information.

Key Features and Availability

The call recording feature is available to premium Truecaller users on both Android and iOS devices. It supports transcriptions in English and Hindi, catering to the diverse linguistic landscape of India.

Recording Process on Android and iOS

On Android devices, users will find a dedicated recording button within the Truecaller dialer. For other dialers, a floating recording button will appear.

On iOS, the process differs slightly due to Apple's CallKit restrictions. To record incoming or outgoing calls, users must initiate the call, open the Truecaller app, and tap on the ""Record a call"" feature in the search tab. The app will call another recording line, and users must manually merge the calls to start recording.

Post-Call Processing and Storage

Once the call ends, the Truecaller app processes the audio and sends a notification when the transcription is ready. On iOS, recordings are stored locally, with the option to save them in iCloud.

Truecaller's Financial Performance and User Growth

Despite facing some challenges, Truecaller has maintained a strong user base. Its monthly active users grew by 11% to 374 million, and daily active users increased by 12% to 305 million. India accounts for over 70% of both user groups.

Focus on Subscriber Revenue

Truecaller aims to encourage users to subscribe to its premium plan, which starts at ₹79 per month or ₹529 per year. This plan includes features like call recording, ad-free experience, and more.

Regulatory Landscape and Competition

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recently proposed a caller ID service called calling name presentation (CNAP) for cell networks. However, Truecaller does not view this service as a direct competitor.

Truecaller's Future Prospects

Analysts believe that Truecaller may face challenges in rapidly improving its Indian ad market revenue. The company is focusing on growing its subscriber revenue, particularly in the US and selected markets in Latin America and Africa.

Conclusion

Truecaller's call recording feature is a valuable addition for users who need to capture and transcribe important conversations. While the company faces some financial hurdles, its strong user growth and focus on subscriber revenue indicate a promising future.

In a world where smartphones have become indispensable, the rear panel of our devices often goes unnoticed, serving as a blank canvas of untapped potential. While the front of our phones boasts vibrant displays and powerful cameras, the back remains an underutilized space.

Enter the Infinix E-Color Shift, a smartphone concept that breathes new life into the neglected backside of our devices. This innovative technology transforms the rear panel into a colorful and dynamic display, capable of displaying a wide range of images, patterns, and animations.

Unlike traditional e-ink displays, which are typically monochrome and power-hungry, the E-Color Shift employs a unique technology that consumes minimal power while maintaining a static image even when the battery is depleted. This remarkable feat is achieved by applying different voltages to the microstructure within the display, causing corresponding color particles to move and display the desired colors.

While the E-Color Shift prototype showcased at MWC in Barcelona was still in its early stages of development, it offered a glimpse into the potential of this technology. The dummy unit, connected to an external battery pack, allowed users to experiment with various color combinations and patterns, creating personalized designs that reflected their style and preferences.

The E-Color Shift's potential applications extend beyond mere aesthetics. Imagine using the rear display to display notifications, weather updates, or music controls without having to turn on the main screen. It could also serve as a convenient way to share photos, videos, or messages with friends and family, simply by flipping the phone over.

Of course, the E-Color Shift is not without its limitations. The technology is still in its infancy, and it remains to be seen whether it will make its way to commercially available devices. Additionally, the practicality of having a secondary display on the back of a phone may be questionable, considering that it is often covered by a case or placed face down on a surface.

Despite these challenges, the Infinix E-Color Shift represents an exciting step forward in smartphone design. It challenges the conventional notion of a smartphone's form and function, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with mobile technology. As the technology continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how it shapes the future of smartphones and opens up new possibilities for user interaction and personalization.

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), women have long been underrepresented and their contributions often overlooked. To shed light on their remarkable work, TechCrunch is launching a series of interviews highlighting women who are shaping the AI revolution.

One such trailblazer is Amba Kak, Executive Director of the AI Now Institute. Amba's journey into AI began during her law school days in India, where she grappled with the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. Intrigued by the open-ended questions surrounding the role of technology in society, she delved into policymaking, working with organizations like the Federal Trade Commission and Mozilla.

Amba's work at the AI Now Institute focuses on crafting policy recommendations to address concerns arising from AI's rapid advancement. She believes that regulation and advocacy can shape the trajectory of AI to serve public interests rather than solely benefiting corporations or the powerful.

One of Amba's proudest achievements is the 2023 AI Landscape report, which offered a timely analysis of the AI economy and its impact on society. It challenged the prevailing narratives of AI's omniscience and inevitability, emphasizing the need for critical examination and action to mitigate potential harms.

Amba also played a pivotal role at the UK AI Safety Summit, where she represented the public interest among government leaders and AI executives. She effectively conveyed the message that AI's concentration of power within a narrow section of the tech industry is a cause for concern.

Amba recognizes the challenges faced by women and minorities in the male-dominated tech industry. However, she urges them to stand their ground and challenge the status quo. She believes that diverse perspectives are crucial in shaping the future of AI and ensuring that it serves the interests of all.

For those seeking to enter the AI field, Amba advises resilience and persistence. She emphasizes the importance of claiming expertise and authority in matters of technology, despite attempts to undermine critique from non-traditional backgrounds. She encourages women to have a say in the future of AI, as it will impact everyone, especially marginalized communities.

Amba's work and insights offer valuable perspectives on the need for inclusive and responsible AI development. Her dedication to addressing the power dynamics and structural inequalities within the tech industry is a testament to her commitment to shaping a future where AI serves humanity as a whole.
