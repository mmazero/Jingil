A former cybersecurity engineer, Shakeeb Ahmed, was sentenced to three years behind bars after admitting to stealing roughly $12 million in cryptocurrency from two different platforms. This story serves as a reminder that crime doesn't pay, especially when it comes to digital assets.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York made the announcement regarding Ahmed's punishment following his conviction. According to prosecutors, Ahmed had exploited vulnerabilities in two separate cryptocurrency exchanges, leading to the theft of millions of dollars worth of digital currency. Although representatives for Ahmed didn't immediately reply to requests for comments, the consequences of his actions were severe and far-reaching.

At the time of his arrest, Ahmed was employed as a senior security engineer for an international tech firm and had formerly held positions at well-known companies like Amazon—though he wasn't currently affiliated with them during his wrongdoings. One of his targets remained undisclosed; however, it is known that he successfully breached Crema Finance, a Solana-based platform, in early July 2022. Following this success, he proceeded to penetrate Nirvana Finance, making off with $9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. As a result of these attacks, Nirvana Finance ceased operations due to losing almost all its funds.

Ahmed confessed guilt to carrying out both cyberattacks, demonstrating remorse for his criminal activities. However, his attempts to negotiate favorable terms with Crema Finance prior to being caught showed questionable judgment. He offered to return most of the stolen funds if they paid him a ""finder's fee"" of $1.5 million and agreed not to involve law enforcement. Naturally, Crema Finance refused such a dubious arrangement, prompting Ahmed's eventual capture.

This situation highlights how some individuals involved in the crypto sector may view illicit activities as just another part of doing business. A practice commonly called 'white hatting,' despite bearing similarities to black-hat techniques since it entails hacking a system and stealing funds without permission, does not sit well with legal authorities. While white-hat practices usually benefit the community through discovering bugs and improving overall security, criminals attempting to justify illegal acts under this guise will face strict punishments.

Aside from serving three years in prison, Ahmed received an additional three years of supervised release, along with orders to forfeit $12.4 million and pay restitutions exceeding $5 million to the affected parties. It goes without saying that venturing into illegal schemes ultimately leads to dire consequences for everyone involved.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fbi-bitcoin-dark-web.jpg?resize=1200,638",2024-04-12 16:39:59,"Meta Description:

In these types of assaults, malevolent actors utilize login credentials obtained from previous data breaches and attempt to use them across multiple platforms. As reported by the corporation, less than 400 instances led to illicit purchases of Roku hardware and streaming subscriptions utilizing the saved payment information associated with the impacted users' accounts. Fortunately, Roku took swift action and issued refunds to all affected clients.

With roughly 80 million active users, Roku emphasized that the perpetrators could only obtain limited information, specifically excluding sensitive personal data and complete credit card numbers. Interestingly enough, the firm detected the latest security issue during its ongoing efforts to inform around 15,000 Roku consumers whose accounts had already fallen prey to a prior credential stuffing event.

To strengthen its defenses against such threats, Roku introduced two-factor authentication (2FA) for its users. Implementing 2FA adds an extra layer of protection to digital profiles by requiring users to input a dynamic, time-limited passcode alongside their regular username and password combination. Consequently, even if threat actors lay hold of a user's password via data leaks elsewhere, they will still need the secondary verification code to successfully penetrate the target's Roku account.

Conclusion

Although the recent Roku security mishaps may cause concern among its vast customer base, taking proactive measures like enabling two-factor authentication can significantly reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim. Streaming enthusiasts must stay vigilant when managing their online accounts and practice caution regarding potential risks related to shared or recycled login credentials. With proper awareness and preventive steps, users can better safeguard themselves against credential stuffing attacks and enjoy uninterrupted entertainment experiences.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/roku-glitch.jpg?resize=1200,778",2024-04-12 16:04:05,"Protect Your Roku Account Now!

Have you ever wondered what Taylor Swift and a group of improv comedians pretending to be wizards have in common? Apart from the shared ability to fill Madison Square Garden, their fans share a mutual dislike for a familiar foe - Ticketmaster. This time, however, the issue isn't related to overwhelming demand, but rather due to the controversial practice of dynamic pricing.

Dimension 20, Dropout's Dungeons & Dragons actual play show, is on the verge of selling out a 19,000-seater venue shortly after ticket sales opened to the general public. While watching people play tabletop roleplaying games might appear unusual to outsiders, the appeal is undeniable—especially when considering the challenges faced during ticketing. Fans of the show find themselves grappling with increasing prices as more tickets are bought; only a few hours post-opening, upper bowl tickets initially listed at $800 had dropped down to $330. Quite steep, even for diehard enthusiasts.

As evidenced by reactions across social media platforms, many Dimension 20 followers feel bewildered and frustrated, particularly given the irony of skyrocketing costs associated with a staunchly anti-capitalist show. Yet, despite these concerns, the sheer popularity surrounding such events signals promising growth opportunities for actual play shows and the wider creator community.

A decade ago, mammoth-scale productions featuring online personalities seemed inconceivable compared to conventional stardom. However, things have changed drastically. Back in 2013, YouTube stars John and Hank Green performing at Carnegie Hall made headlines – quite impressive, considering the venue accommodates roughly 3,000 attendees. Fast forward to today, the boundary separating digital influencers from mainstream fame has considerably blurred.

Consider the trajectory of Dropout—the brainchild of former CollegeHumor executive Sam Reich, following the collapse of the humor platform. Having transformed into an independent entity, Dropout consistently delivers captivating comedy programs, including Dimension 20, thereby rivaling longstanding shows like Saturday Night Live. More importantly, Dropout nurtures charismatic talents whose infectious energy transcends individual episodes.

The success stories don't end here. Four Dimension 20 cast members ventured into launching their own creator-owned actual play podcast titled 'Worlds Beyond Number,' amassing over 30,000 paying supporters on Patreon. Clearly, the buzz generated by the creator industry overshadows fluctuations in Silicon Valley investment cycles. After all, creators possess the power to pack arenas.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dimension20-msg.jpg?resize=1200,810",2024-04-12 17:30:41,Dive into the world of actual play shows as Dungeons & Dragons' Dimension 20 sells out Madison Square Garden!
