Introduction

In a significant leap towards sustainable energy solutions, researchers from the University of Cambridge have discovered a technique to supercharge the efficiency of sustainable fuel generation. By manipulating the crystalline structure of low-cost, abundant, and non-toxic copper oxides, the team has achieved a 70% improvement in the performance of light-harvesting semiconductors used for converting water into clean hydrogen fuel. This breakthrough, published in the journal Nature, offers a promising pathway for powering the transition from fossil fuels to clean, storable, and infrastructure-compatible sustainable fuels.

The Challenge of Oxide Semiconductors

Copper (I) oxide, or cuprous oxide, has long been considered a potential low-cost replacement for silicon in solar cells. Its ability to capture sunlight and convert it into electric charge is moderately effective, but most of the generated charge tends to get lost, limiting the material's overall performance. This issue arises due to the mismatch between how deeply light is absorbed and how far charges travel within the material, leaving much of the oxide below the top layer inactive.

Researchers have discovered that the key to optimizing cuprous oxide performance lies in fine-tuning its crystal growth. In oxide semiconductors, performance losses typically occur in the bulk material rather than on the surface, as is common in most solar cell materials. This unique characteristic requires a tailored approach to crystal growth to enhance the material's efficiency in generating and moving electric charges.

Single-Crystal Thin Films and Crystal Orientation

Single-crystal thin films, thin slices of material with a highly-ordered crystal structure, are often used in electronics. However, the conventional process of creating these films is complex and time-consuming. The Cambridge research team has developed a method for growing high-quality cuprous oxide films at ambient pressure and room temperature using thin film deposition techniques. By precisely controlling growth and flow rates in the chamber, the researchers can ""shift"" the crystals into a particular orientation.

In these copper oxide crystals, the researchers found that electrons move an order of magnitude further when traveling diagonally through the crystal cube rather than along",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-simple-twist-improve.jpg,2024-04-24 11:00:01,"Meta Description:

In the world of software development, the importance of rigorous code testing cannot be overstated. However, developers often dislike testing their own code, and for good reason - auditing protocols require independent verification. Enter the realm of generative AI, where startups are revolutionizing code testing in all its forms. Companies like Antithesis, CodiumAI, and QA Wolf are just a few of the many startups making waves in this field. Among these is the one-year-old startup Nova AI, which has raised a $1 million pre-seed round and is taking a unique approach to end-to-end testing.

Nova AI targets mid-size to large enterprises with complex codebases and an immediate need for thorough testing. Unlike most startups that begin with small, incremental steps, Nova AI is diving headfirst into the market, catering to a niche that demands comprehensive, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) testing environments. Although the company is understandably tight-lipped about its clientele, it has revealed that its customers are primarily late-stage (Series C or beyond) venture-backed startups in e-commerce, fintech, or consumer products, and ""heavy user experiences.""

The Nova AI platform utilizes generative AI (GenAI) to analyze its customers' code and automatically build tests. This approach is particularly valuable for CI/CD environments, where engineers are constantly shipping bits and pieces into their production code. The company's founders, Zach Smith and Jeffrey Shih, drew upon their experiences as engineers in big tech companies to develop Nova AI. Smith, a former Googler with a background in cloud-related teams, and Shih, an AI expert from Meta, identified the need for a more efficient and comprehensive code testing solution.

One of the critical differentiators for Nova AI is its decision to minimize the use of OpenAI's Chat GPT-4. While OpenAI promises that data from paid business plans is not used to train its models, many enterprises remain skeptical and prefer to keep their data in-house. Nova AI uses alternative open-source models like Llama, developed by Meta, and StarCoder, from the BigCoder community, along with building its own models.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University are paving the way for a new era of immersive displays, bringing us one step closer to merging the real and virtual worlds in a pair of ordinary glasses (Heide et al., 2024). Holographic images, which are inherently three-dimensional, offer the potential for a truly immersive experience by seamlessly integrating with our natural view of the everyday world.

Unlike monitors that simulate depth on a two-dimensional screen, holographic images provide real depth, making them a promising alternative for virtual and augmented reality displays. The immersive nature of holographic imagery allows users to move their heads freely without losing sight of the holographic images, offering a more natural and interactive experience.

The study, titled ""Neural étendue expander for ultra-wide-angle high-fidelity holographic display,"" was published in Nature Communications on April 22, 2024 (Heide et al., 2024). The researchers have developed a device that significantly improves the quality of holographic images, addressing one of the most critical challenges in holographic display technology.

Traditionally, holographic images have been limited by a narrow field of view due to a tradeoff between image size and clarity. This limitation has made it difficult for holographic displays to provide an immersive experience. However, the new device, which consists of a spatial light modulator and a custom-built optical element, filters light to expand the field of view while preserving image stability and fidelity.

The optical element, which resembles a small piece of frosted glass with a precisely etched surface, scatters light in a way that pushes some image elements into frequency bands that are less perceptible to the human eye. This innovative approach improves the quality of the holographic image and expands the field of view, making it possible to create larger images with minimal quality loss.

While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as improving image quality and refining the fabrication process for the optical elements, this research represents a significant step towards practical applications of holograph",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/holographic-displays-o-1.jpg,2024-04-23 12:23:16,"""Discover Nova AI: Utilize open-source LLMs for superior code testing, keeping data in-house.

Introduction

In a surprising turn of events, video game speedrunners, who are notorious for exploiting glitches to complete games in the shortest time possible, have become unlikely allies in the world of software engineering. Researchers from the University of Bristol have discovered that the techniques used by these gamers can provide valuable insights into understanding and addressing bugs in software.

The Quintessential Video Game and Its Glitches

Nintendo's Super Mario series is the epitome of video games. To delve into the world of glitches exploited by speedrunners, the researchers focused on four of the earliest Mario platforming games: Super Mario Bros (1985), Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988), Super Mario World (1990), and Super Mario 64 (1996). These games, despite their age, are still competitively run by speedrunners, with new records being reported regularly.

The researchers analyzed 237 known glitches within these games, classifying a variety of weaknesses. The goal was to explore whether these glitches share similarities with the bugs commonly found in conventional software.

Understanding the Hardware and Software Behind Classic Games

Many early video games, such as the Super Mario series, were developed for consoles with hardware that differs significantly from the more uniform PC-like systems of today. Constraints such as limited memory and buses meant that aggressive optimization and unique tricks were necessary to make games run smoothly. These techniques, while essential for the games' functionality, can lead to bugs due to their niche nature and differences from modern programming practices.

Dr. Joseph Hallett from Bristol's School of Computer Science explained, ""Programming for these systems is closer to embedded development than most modern software. Despite the challenges of programming these systems, new games are still being released and retro-inspired.""

A New Perspective on Software Bugs

The researchers identified seven new categories of weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which were previously unspecified in existing software defect taxonomies. This finding suggests that the bugs exploited by speedrunners may represent a new class of software issues that have not been previously considered by developers.

Dr. Hallett stated, ""We found",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/super-mario.jpg,2024-04-23 16:10:05,"Master Droopy Eyelid Solutions for Seamless Apple Vision Pro Experience: Enable Wrist Tracking & Optimize Settings (18 words)

In a groundbreaking study, scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have revealed that countries with limited access to renewable energy sources could significantly cut costs in green steel and green chemical production by importing from renewable-rich countries. This innovative approach creates strong incentives for businesses to invest in low-emission production facilities in these regions, while renewable-scarce countries could focus on downstream production and refinement to maintain industrial competitiveness.

The research, published in Nature Energy, emphasizes that the use of renewable electricity and green hydrogen is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in heavy industries such as steel and chemicals production. However, not all industrialized nations have the necessary geographical conditions to produce these materials in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices in the long term.

Lead author Philipp Verpoort explains, ""Renewable-scarce countries like parts of the EU, Japan, and South Korea could save between 18 to 38 percent in production costs by relocating their production of industrial basic materials like green steel and chemicals based on green hydrogen to countries where renewable energy is cheap.""

Importing intermediate goods and focusing on downstream production and refinement can be a more cost-effective strategy for these countries compared to producing green hydrogen domestically or importing it, which could result in diminished long-term competitiveness.

The researchers analyzed the green value chains of three primary basic materials: steel, urea, and ethylene. They expect an electricity-price difference of 4ct/kWh between some existing renewable-scarce industrial production sites (e.g., Germany, Japan, or South Korea) and favorable locations elsewhere (e.g., Australia, Chile, South Africa) in 2040.

Comparing different decarbonization strategies, the study demonstrates that cost savings in case of relocation could be substantial and that importing hydrogen is not a cost-effective strategy—especially when imports occur via ship.

In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly sophisticated, the potential for misuse has never been greater. Recently, OpenAI's generative AI program, Sora, showcased its ability to create strikingly realistic videos based on simple text prompts. While this breakthrough is impressive, it also raises concerns about the widespread creation of misleading and deceptive content.

According to a study by Drexel University, existing methods for detecting manipulated digital media are insufficient against AI-generated video. However, researchers have found success with a machine learning algorithm that can be trained to recognize the unique ""fingerprints"" of various video generators, such as Stable Video Diffusion, Video-Crafter, and Cog-Video. This algorithm can also learn to detect new AI generators after studying just a few examples of their videos.

Matthew Stamm, Ph.D., an associate professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and director of the Multimedia and Information Security Lab (MISL), emphasizes the importance of staying ahead of bad actors who might use this technology for deception: ""It's more than a bit unnerving that this video technology could be released before there is a good system for detecting fakes created by bad actors.""

Over the past decade, Stamm's lab has been actively involved in flagging digitally manipulated images and videos. Recently, they have been particularly busy due to the surge in political misinformation created using photo and video editing programs. The lab's tools use a sophisticated machine learning program called a constrained neural network, which can learn the difference between unedited media and manipulated content at the sub-pixel level.

However, AI-generated video technology introduces new challenges in detection. With no editing or pixel manipulation involved, standard forensic detection programs may struggle to identify AI-generated videos. To tackle this issue, researchers must develop new techniques to spot traces left behind by generative-AI programs during video construction.

The study tested 11 publicly available synthetic image detectors, which were highly effective at identifying manipulated images. However, these detectors failed to identify AI-generated videos. To address this gap, researchers must focus on developing detection tools specifically designed for AI-generated content.

Graphical abstract: A visual representation of the carbon electrode's surface functionality and its impact on the performance of vanadium redox flow batteries.

Introduction:

Renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are indispensable in the global pursuit of clean and sustainable energy. However, they face a significant challenge in managing fluctuations and intermittency. Grid-scale energy storage systems, such as flow batteries, have emerged as promising solutions. Among these, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have gained substantial attention due to their high efficiency, scalability, safety, and near-room-temperature operation conditions. The ability to size power and energy capacities independently is another advantage of VRFBs.

The core of VRFBs lies in the electrochemical reactions that occur at the surfaces of the electrodes. Modifying the electrode surface can significantly impact the electrochemical activity and, subsequently, the overall battery performance. A team of scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have delved into the surface functionality of carbon electrodes and their propensity for degradation during electrochemical cycles to extend VRFB lifespans.

The Study:

The researchers employed a combined experimental-theoretical approach, using carbon K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize carbon electrodes prepared under different conditions. The goal was to identify relevant functional groups and their unique spectroscopic features.

Key Findings:

Wenyu Sun, an LLNL researcher and the first author of the study, highlighted the importance of understanding the active species present on carbon electrodes, as they play a crucial role in determining the electrochemical performance of VRFBs.

Introduction

Imagine a world where renewable energy is harnessed from the most unexpected places, like the meeting point of salty and freshwater. Estuaries, where rivers merge with the sea, are not only hotspots for birdwatching and kayaking but also potential sources of sustainable ""blue"" osmotic energy. Researchers have developed a groundbreaking semipermeable membrane that converts osmotic energy into electricity, producing power densities twice as high as commercial membranes in lab tests.

The Power of Osmotic Energy

Osmotic energy can be generated wherever salt gradients are found, making it a highly adaptable renewable energy source. The traditional method of capturing this energy involves reverse electrodialysis (RED) membranes, which function as a kind of ""salt battery."" These membranes generate electricity from pressure differences caused by the salt gradient.

To optimize the capture of osmotic energy, positively charged ions from seawater, such as sodium, flow through the system to the freshwater, increasing the pressure on the membrane. Enhancing the membrane's ability to minimize internal resistance and maximize output power is key to improving electricity capture.

A Game-Changing Membrane Design

Dongdong Ye, Xingzhen Qin, and their team designed a semipermeable membrane made from environmentally friendly materials, aiming to minimize internal resistance and maximize output power. Their RED membrane prototype featured separate channels for ion transport and electron transport, achieved by sandwiching a negatively charged cellulose hydrogel (for ion transport) between layers of an organic, electrically conductive polymer called polyaniline (for electron transport).

This innovative decoupled channel design resulted in higher ion conductivity and lower resistivity compared to homogenous membranes made from the same materials. In an estuary environment simulation, the prototype demonstrated an output power density 2.34 times higher than a commercial RED membrane and maintained stable performance over 16 days of continuous operation. A salt battery array made from 20 of these RED membranes generated enough electricity to power a calculator, LED light, and stopwatch.

In the not-so-distant future, passengers traveling in vehicles may enjoy immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences that manipulate their sense of speed, all while avoiding motion sickness. A team of researchers from the UK and Canada has developed a pioneering system that controls users' perceptions of speed in VR, opening up new possibilities for entertainment and productivity during travel. This groundbreaking system will be presented at the Association of Computing Machinery CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May 2024.

Motion sickness is a common issue in VR, arising from a mismatch between the physical motion sensed by the vestibular system and the visual perception of movement. By manipulating users' virtual speed, this new system aims to create enjoyable experiences without causing discomfort.

Some existing VR systems attempt to reduce motion sickness by matching real-world vehicle movements to perceived movements in the headset. However, this study explores whether further manipulation of VR users' impressions of movement could provide more engaging and varied virtual experiences.

The research team built their system on the principles of translational gain and attenuation, which alter real-world movements into virtual perceptions without a one-to-one correlation. Translational gain, for instance, can translate a half-meter step in a user's living room into a five-meter movement in a virtual space, generally without causing motion sickness. Translational attenuation works in the opposite direction, shrinking large real-world movements into smaller virtual ones.

Dr. Graham Wilson, of the University of Glasgow's School of Computing Science, is one of the paper's lead authors. He explains, ""VR technology is becoming more widely accepted and adopted for use in entertainment and productivity applications, but it can still make some people feel unwell, particularly in vehicles. By exploring the potential of translational gain and attenuation, we can expand the scope of VR experiences during travel and create a more engaging environment for users.""

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have been attempting to mimic human cognitive abilities, such as image recognition and question-answering. However, unlike the human mind, these AI systems usually maintain consistent performance or even improve over time. A recent study by researchers at the University of California, Irvine has taken a novel approach to this field by intentionally inducing cognitive decline in AI agents, aiming to enhance our understanding of complex systems, improve interpretability, and increase security.

The concept for this research was inspired by discussions between the authors and their personal experiences with cognitive decline. The team wanted to explore the effects of deliberate cognitive decline in AI systems, specifically using large language models (LLMs) like the LLaMA 2 model, to investigate the phenomenon of 'neural erosion.'

Neural erosion involves the intentional ablation of synapses or neurons or the addition of Gaussian noise during or after training. This process leads to a controlled decline in the LLMs' performance on IQ tests. The researchers discovered that when artificial synapses and neurons were removed from the LLaMA 2 model, its performance declined, following a distinct pattern.

Their findings revealed that the LLM loses its ability to think abstractly, followed by mathematical degradation, and ultimately, a loss in linguistic ability, responding to prompts incoherently. This observed pattern is reminiscent of the neurodegeneration patterns observed in humans, providing valuable insights into the functioning of complex AI systems and the capabilities that are first and last to decline when their underlying structure is compromised.

Although this study did not aim to replicate human brain diseases, the authors acknowledge the potential for future research in this area. The team plans to extend their study to include specific tests of AI systems, emulate other neural diseases and neurodiversity, and apply their methods to improve AI security and interpretability. By focusing on exploring new frontiers in AI studies, the researchers hope to pave the way for innovative techniques that leverage AI neuro-erosion patterns to address real-world problems.

","Title: The Marvel of Animal Locomotion: Unveiling the Gaps between Biological and Robotic Running Systems

Introduction

Robotics engineers have spent decades and millions of research dollars in an attempt to develop a robot capable of walking or running as efficiently as animals. However, even with such significant investments, robots still cannot match the endurance, agility, and robustness displayed by various animal species. A study published in Science Robotics aimed to understand and quantify the differences between running robots and their biological counterparts. This article summarizes the findings of this interdisciplinary research, highlighting the areas where robots underperform and discussing the potential future of robotics technology.

The Study and Key Findings

The research team, composed of experts from leading universities, examined five different ""subsystems"" that contribute to a running robot's overall performance: Power, Frame, Actuation, Sensing, and Control. The study found that, with minor exceptions, the engineered subsystems outperformed their biological equivalents, sometimes radically. However, when it comes to whole-system movement, animals outshine robots in terms of efficiency, agility, and robustness.

1. Power

In terms of power, the study found that animals' energy-producing components, such as muscles and tendons, perform poorly compared to fabricated parts. Engineered energy-storing components, such as springs and batteries, can store and release energy more efficiently and consistently than their biological counterparts.

2. Frame

The frame, or the physical structure of a robot or animal, displays mixed results. While engineered frames can be stronger and lighter than animal skeletons, they lack the adaptability and flexibility exhibited by biological structures.

3. Actuation

Actuation, the process by which motion is generated, is another area where robots outperform animals. Robots' motors and servos can provide more precise and consistent motion than animal muscles, which can be affected by factors such as fatigue and temperature.

4. Sensing

Sensing systems, which allow robots and animals to perceive and interact with their environment, show a clear advantage for robots. Advanced sensors and data processing techniques allow robots to gather and analyze information more accurately and rapidly than animals.

5. Control

Introduction

As Caribbean islands embrace renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce their dependence on expensive fossil fuels, they face a unique challenge: hurricanes. These powerful storms can significantly impact solar energy generation, leaving island residents without a reliable source of electricity. Researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a comprehensive modeling method to predict the reduction in electricity generation caused by hurricane cloud cover and explored the potential of super grids as a solution to maintain equitable access to electricity.

The Impact of Hurricanes on Solar Energy Generation

The Caribbean's abundant sunshine is a valuable resource for generating solar power. However, hurricanes can overshadow solar panels, leading to a drop in electricity generation. To address this issue, Rodney Itiki, a postdoctoral research associate with ORNL's Power Systems Resilience group, developed a modeling method that considers all possible hurricane trajectories and their impact on solar energy generation. By analyzing how a large hurricane would reduce power from known solar installations, Itiki's algorithm can help design power systems that account for the worst-case scenario.

The Potential of Super Grids

Super grids, a collection of interconnected grids, offer a promising solution to maintain electricity flow during hurricanes. By connecting grids across island chains or between continents, solar power losses in one region can be compensated by the uninterrupted generation in another. Researchers at ORNL modeled four different super grid configurations, including a standalone U.S. grid, a standalone Caribbean super grid, a U.S.-Caribbean super grid, and a super grid connecting the U.S., Caribbean islands, and South America.

The Results

The largest super grid configuration included 90 photovoltaic plants within the hurricane corridor and solar farms in regions unaffected by hurricanes, such as California and Brazil. The model showed that some solar plants lost as much as 88% of their generating capacity for two days while shaded by hurricane clouds. The U.S.-Caribbean super grid proved to be the most effective at increasing power reliability, while the standalone Caribbean super grid offered the least assistance.

In the past few days, you might have noticed some changes while scrolling through your Facebook or Instagram feeds. Meta, the social media giant, has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into its platforms with the introduction of Meta AI. This new feature aims to assist users in completing tasks, learning, creating, and connecting with relevant content. However, it has left many users wondering if they can turn off this new AI companion.

Meta AI, similar to popular tools like ChatGPT, is designed to help users ""get things done, learn, create, and connect with the things that matter to you."" Although it works similarly to ChatGPT, users have expressed frustration with accidentally activating the chatbot when browsing posts or searching for profiles.

Unfortunately, as of now, there is no official way to disable Meta AI from Facebook or Instagram. Contrary to popular belief, Meta AI's help page acknowledges that ""Meta AI's responses may not always be accurate or appropriate."" This discrepancy between user experiences and the chatbot's guidance has led to confusion.

While you cannot disable Meta AI, you can avoid it if you prefer. On Facebook, the search button has been replaced by an animated blue ring, housing a new ""Ask Meta AI anything"" search bar. If you start typing a name, profiles will still appear as they did before. For specific post or picture searches, the functionality remains unchanged.

Despite its quirks, Meta AI does offer some benefits. You can use it to create content, generate images, and plan events through Messenger or WhatsApp. The chatbot can also provide suggestions related to posts, offering additional information or context. For instance, if a friend posts about visiting the cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C., Meta AI might suggest asking when the best time to see them is.

With Meta AI being a relatively new addition, the question remains: Will users eventually embrace or avoid Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp? Only time will tell as users adapt to this new age of social media interaction. In the meantime, understanding how Meta AI works can help you better navigate the ever-changing landscape of social media platforms.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/2821be4bd7bb75298ba3d159b14e396aff634885/2024/04/24/ec894527-1339-4f05-8308-8fc498207656/pxl-20240424-181716738.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-24 00:00:00,"Discover how to navigate Meta AI on Facebook & Instagram!

Introduction:

Imagine a future where air taxis and autonomous drones zip through the skies, bypassing ground traffic congestion. This vision is not far-fetched, as companies are already developing hybrid electric ""flying cars"" that take off and land vertically while efficiently soaring through the air for longer distances. However, ensuring the safety of these aircraft is of paramount importance, as they must be able to withstand various disturbances during flight, such as gusty winds, unexpected obstacles, or mechanical failures.

A team of engineers at Caltech, led by Soon-Jo Chung, has developed an onboard Machine Learning-based control system to help flying vehicles detect and compensate for disturbances, ensuring their continued flight. Dubbed ""Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance"" (NFFT), this new method introduces the concept of virtual sensors for fault detection using machine learning and adaptive control techniques.

The Challenge of Redundancy and Failure Detection:

To minimize energy consumption during urban flights, engineers are designing hybrid-electric aircraft with multiple propellers, or rotors, for redundancy. However, the addition of fixed wings to reduce energy consumption also increases the number of possible failure points. Detecting and identifying failures in real-time is a complex task that requires a novel approach.

An Alternative Solution: Neural-Fly for Fault Tolerance (NFFT)

NFFT is an AI-driven control system that builds upon previous efforts in deep learning and adaptive control techniques. The system uses a neural network pre-trained on real-life flight data, which learns and adapts in real-time based on a limited number of changing parameters. By estimating the effectiveness of each rotor, NFFT can detect failures without requiring additional sensors or hardware.

The NFFT method observes the attitudes and positions of the aircraft as it moves from point A to point B. If the aircraft deviates from its desired path, NFFT detects the anomaly and compensates for the error in less than a second, ensuring the aircraft remains controllable even in the event of a motor failure.
