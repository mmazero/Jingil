https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Climate change could cost Texans up to 1.5 months of outdoor time by 2080"" ","The Earth's climate is a complex and multifaceted aspect of our world, with many different ways to describe its effects. Researchers at MIT have developed a tool that allows people to see how many ""outdoor days"" their region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked. The results of this tool might be alarming or comforting, depending on where you live.

In California, France, and Germany, the climate will be slightly more clement in the spring and fall, adding anywhere from a few days to nearly a month of outdoor weather compared with historical records. The UK will be even better off, gaining 40 outdoor days by the end of the century. However, some temperate places like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan will lose a week or more of outdoor days. Additionally, the picture looks even more dire for countries with vulnerable populations, such as Nigeria and India, who will lose nearly two months and almost two and a half months of outdoor days, respectively.

These predictions are based on a field of study known as climate scenario analysis, which seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. The MIT tool is a relatable application of this field of study and has the potential to help shape an uncertain future.

Many startups in the space are using this relatively newfound predictive capability to help give shape to an uncertain future. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern all focus on providing customers with dashboards and data feeds that they can tailor to regions or even assets of interest. These startups determine the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought and deliver reports detailing risk to assets and supply chains. They can also crank out regulatory disclosures, highlighting relevant climate risks.

Investors and insurers are sufficiently worried about how climate change will affect assets and supply chains that these startups have attracted some real cash. Jupiter Intelligence has raised $97 million, while Cervest has raised $43 million, and One Concern has brought in $152 million.

Other markets exposed to the outdoors are also in need of solutions. ClimateAI is targeting agriculture, including agribusiness, lenders, and food and beverage companies, all of which have watched as droughts, floods, and storms have decimated crops. As a result, water risk assessment is a key feature of ClimateAI's forecasts. The startup has raised $37 million so far. Sensible Weather is working on markets that are a little closer to home for most of us. It provides insurance for people embarking on outdoor events and activities, from live concerts to camping and golfing. It works with campgrounds, golf courses, live event operators, and more, allowing them to give customers an option to insure their outing against inclement weather. The startup has landed the startup $22 million in funding.

As more businesses and consumers become aware of how climate change is affecting their lives, their demand for certainty will create a wealth of new markets that will offer these startups and their peers ample opportunity to expand. Climate scenario analysis, once a niche limited to academic labs and insurance companies, appears poised to enter the mainstream.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"""Discover how many 'outdoor days' your region may experience from now until 2100 with MIT's climate scenario analysis tool.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork"," AWS, Redis Fork Valkey, Backed by Google, Oracle, and More - Linux Foundation Hosts ","The Linux Foundation recently announced that it will host Valkey, a fork of the Redis in-memory data store. This announcement comes after Redis Labs switched Redis away from the permissive 3-clause BSD license and adopted the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL) in March 2021. The new license requires commercial agreements to offer Redis-as-a-service, making it incompatible with the standard definition of “open source.” Valkey is backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap.

Now, let's take a few steps back to understand how we got to this point. Redis, a popular data store, has seen several licensing disputes throughout its lifetime. In 2009, Redis founder Salvatore Sanfilippo launched the project under the BSD license, which allowed for commercial forks. In 2013, Garantia, the first major Redis service provider, rebranded to RedisDB, prompting Sanfilippo and the community to push back. After some time, Garantia eventually changed its name to Redis Labs and then, in 2021, to Redis.

In 2015, Sanfilippo joined Redis Labs, and in 2020, he transferred his IP to Redis Labs/Redis before stepping down from the company. In the meantime, Redis changed how it licenses its Redis Modules, which include visualization tools, a client SDK, and more. Initially, Redis went with the Apache License with the added Commons Clause that restricted others from selling and hosting these modules. However, in 2021, Redis announced that it had changed its licensing to the Server Side Public License (SSPL), which required commercial agreements to offer Redis-as-a-service.

Redis Labs' CEO Rowan Trollope reiterated that the large cloud vendors profited from the open-source version and were free to enter a commercial agreement with Redis. However, the current reality is that the big cloud vendors, with the notable exception of Microsoft, quickly rallied behind Valkey. The Valkey fork originated at AWS, where longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson started the project in her own GitHub account. Olson noted that she always knew that this change was a possibility and within the rights of the BSD license.

In conclusion, the creation of Valkey, a fork of Redis, is a response to Redis Labs' decision to adopt the Server Side Public License (SSPL) in March 2021. Valkey is backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, and it's already been embraced by many Redis maintainers, including AWS's longtime Redis maintainer, Madelyn Olson. Redis Labs' decision to switch to the SSPL has opened the door for commercial forks of the project, and it's unlikely that Valkey will be the last one to emerge.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-898655676.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-31 16:30:06,"""React Native: A Beginner's Guide to Building Native Mobile Apps"" - Learn how to build native mobile apps with React Native, a popular open-source framework for cross-platform development.

Introduction

Simplicity, often mistaken for ease, can prove to be quite challenging to achieve. Will Lawrence, Co-Founder and CTO of Iron Sheepdog, understands this concept all too well. With a mission to revolutionize the short-haul trucking industry, Iron Sheepdog focuses on developing user-friendly technology. Despite facing fierce competition, the company prides itself on achieving a level of adoption that remains elusive to many others in the sector. Headquartered in Williamsburg, Virginia, Iron Sheepdog provides software designed to optimize and bring efficiency to the fragmented world of short-haul trucking. By enabling businesses to monitor their contracted fleet while providing truckers with an intuitive app, the firm aims to create greater transparency and streamline operations.

A Promising Investment & Adoption Strategy

Recently, Iron Sheepdog secured a $10 million Series B funding round led by SJF Ventures, with additional backing from Grand Ventures, Supply Chain Ventures, and strategic partners. According to Mike Van Sickel, Iron Sheepdog's Co-Founder and CEO, the past few years were dedicated to attaining customer traction and ensuring profitability. Having achieved success in these areas, the time has come for expansion. To foster trust among short-haul operators—dubbed ""subhaulers""—the primary challenge lies in encouraging widespread usage of the application. As Van Sickel aptly notes, ""Trust is the most crucial aspect; we must convince the subhauler to genuinely employ the app.""

Born Out Of Experience And Frustration

What sets Iron Sheepdog apart stems from the personal experiences of its founders. Although none had driven short-haul trucks themselves, they shared frustrations stemming from their previous employment involving managing such services. They noticed a significant gap in available software catering specifically to short-haul truck management compared to other facets of their business. In response, they created Iron Sheepdog to simplify the laborious processes faced by both short-haul drivers and the firms utilizing their services. Since its establishment, Iron Sheepdog has witnessed consistent annual growth, doubling in size each year thanks to its unique, ground-up strategy.

An Unconventional Approach To Success

Rather than concentrating efforts solely on winning over contractors, Iron Sheepdog took a different route. It began by directly addressing the needs of short-haul truckers. Recognizing that simplicity leads to higher acceptance rates, the team focused on crafting an accessible, straightforward mobile app linked to prompt payment processing. By successfully attracting thousands of subhaulers onto the platform, a ripple effect ensued. Brokers followed suit due to increased demand from truckers, and subsequently, interested contractors joined as well, lured by the prospect of tapping into a vast pool of skilled professionals.

Optimization Opportunities Abound

As Iron Sheepdog continues to grow its broker and trucker base, further opportunities arise to maximize the potential of these connections. Businesses may begin allocating tasks more efficiently, assigning multiple jobs to individual trucks or consolidating delivery locations. Such strategies hold the potential to reduce overall transportation costs and minimize environmental impact via decreased fuel consumption. Furthermore, the data gathered throughout this interconnected ecosystem offers valuable insights for future improvements in operational efficiencies.

Why Iron Sheepdog Matters

Several factors contribute to Iron Sheepdog's significance within today's market landscape. First, investments in construction technology startups continue to rise, yet innovations surrounding transport logistics receive comparatively limited attention. Second, while several companies strive towards automating heavy machinery and improving urban distribution systems, fewer focus explicitly on enhancing medium and light-duty vehicle performance. Finally, Iron Sheepdog distinguishes itself by emphasizing adoption above all else—a vital component often neglected when designing enterprise software solutions. Ultimately, successful integration hinges upon the end users embracing novel technologies wholeheartedly. Otherwise, even the most sophisticated tools risk becoming obsolete before realizing their full potential.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ISD_broker-truck.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-30 16:00:39,"Iron Sheepdog's short-haul trucking software simplifies operations and fosters trust in the fragmented industry.

However, despite their promising amplification and sensing capabilities, OECTs have their limitations, such as limited stability and slow redox processes, which can impair their performance.

Recently, researchers at Northwestern University have introduced a new strategy to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECTs using electron-beam exposure (eBL). This method allows for the micropatterning of organic semiconductors without using masks or chemical solvents, which can damage the materials. The patterned films resulting from this process are ultra-small and high-density, with well-defined, conducting channel regions. Moreover, the eBL strategy enables the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits.

The researchers successfully used their fabrication strategy to create various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These circuits performed remarkably well while maintaining excellent operational stability.

This study highlights the potential of e-beam exposure as a scalable fabrication method for OECTs, contributing to their integration into electronic devices.

Are you tired of struggling to find, hire, and maintain a team of cybersecurity professionals? The industry is facing a nearly 4 million person workforce shortage, and that number is only growing. But there's hope on the horizon: generative AI can help address this shortage and have a positive impact on cybersecurity.

Gen AI can be applied to technical documentation and other cybersecurity information to create more dynamic training that meets new hires where they are, versus building training material for a specific user background and requiring new hires to do that work before joining an organization. It can also be used to process and distill information into something very precise and meaningful for the user, reducing the time that security analysts need to find information to do their job and communicate with their broader team.

Gen AI can create more user-friendly documentation, reducing the amount of time spent combing through technical documentation and allowing users to access information faster. Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze and synthesize data, reducing the time that security analysts need to find information to do their job and communicate with their broader team.

Gen AI can also be used to reduce the risk of burnout for security professionals by automating tedious activities such as searching for documentation and logging processes and findings. By reducing the ""busy work"" that burdens teams, the focus can be on increasing time spent remediating and reducing risk.

One area that would benefit greatly from gen AI is continual education. As cybersecurity threats, attack vectors, and bad actors are constantly changing, it's essential that security professionals have access to the latest information. Gen AI can be used to gather and distill information pertinent to an industry vertical from an organization's trusted sources, from favorite trade publications and industry associations to other preferred research and resource sites.

Gen AI can also be used to improve cross-team organizational security communications. For example, if an organization sees persistent phishing attempts, gen AI can analyze the text and create custom messaging based on each department's function to best equip them to mitigate the risk.

But with all cutting-edge technology, we must carefully consider how it should be used and put the proper policies and other safeguards in place. For example, we recommend that organizations choose a gen AI platform and put in place a paid, contractual relationship with the vendor to",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-giant-unlocked-padlock-letting-out-a-burst-of-li-7KrtL86MSyS_AD7ADE46qw-s-BURFAZT7mJv6iRNfMBbg-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-30 19:15:00,"Keep your cybersecurity team running smoothly with AI.

This is because they rely on natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that aren't quite perfect yet.

There's a lot of research being done to improve NLP algorithms and make them more accurate. For example, researchers at MIT have recently developed a new algorithm called BERT that can understand the nuances of language much better than previous NLP algorithms.

BERT works by breaking down sentences into smaller pieces called subwords and training a model on a massive corpus of text. This allows the model to understand the relationships between words and phrases in a sentence, which is crucial for understanding the meaning of the text.

Another exciting development in the world of AI is the rise of generative models. These models can create new data based on existing data, which has a lot of potential applications in fields like image and video processing.

One example of a generative model is OpenAI's Sora, which can generate realistic images and videos based on text descriptions. Sora works by learning the patterns in the data and using those patterns to generate new data.

Despite these exciting developments, there are still many challenges to overcome in the world of AI. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that AI systems are fair and unbiased. For example, if an AI system is trained on data that contains biases, it may perpetuate those biases in its outputs.

Another challenge is ensuring that AI systems are safe and secure. As AI systems become more advanced, they may be able to perform tasks that are dangerous or harmful if not used properly.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI are enormous. With continued research and development, AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, from healthcare to transportation to finance.

In conclusion, AI is a rapidly evolving field with exciting potential applications and challenges. As AI systems become more advanced, it's important to ensure that they are developed and used in a safe, ethical, and responsible way. With continued research and development, the future of AI is bright.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sensetime1.jpg?resize=1200,640",2024-03-30 13:01:25,"""Discover the latest advancements in AI and NLP, including BERT and generative models.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/the-market-is-forcing-cloud-vendors-to-relax-data-egress-fees/,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees, Relaxing Cloud Egress Fees: A Natural Progression of the Market,"FOR CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS

In recent months, the big three cloud vendors — Amazon, Microsoft and Google — have relaxed their egress fees, which are a tax of sorts that the cloud companies charge customers to move their data to another vendor.

It’s a way to keep existing customers in the fold, but it’s kind of a ham-handed way to do it, and doesn’t exactly foster goodwill.

As a number of factors come into play, like the reality of a multi-cloud world, a stricter regulatory environment and consumer backlash, these companies are beginning to see the error in their ways by easing these fees, albeit with lots of caveats and a bit of friction involved.

For example, there are limits to the kind of data you can move, and each requires you to contact the vendor and open a request to get your own data out of the cloud.

But it’s a start at least.

This change of heart is really an acknowledgement of changing market dynamics, says John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director at Synergy Research, a firm that tracks the cloud infrastructure market.

“I think this is a natural progression of the market. As true competition heats up, it would do cloud providers no good to be seen as being overly protectionist,” Dinsdale told TechCrunch.

“Giving customers what they want is just the right business strategy. In the IT world of the last few years, legacy companies that have tried to hang on to the old ways of doing things have not done well,” he said.

It’s also clear that we are moving into a multi-cloud world where it’s more important than ever to remove friction around moving data, says Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder at Bobsled, a startup that helps customers move data between clouds.
