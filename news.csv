https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises"," Apple's Antitrust Lawsuit, Microsoft's AI Ambitions, and Nvidia's Surprises ","Welcome to the latest edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the most important news and updates from the tech industry. In this edition, we'll be diving into the latest Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's get started!

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, on the other hand, argues that the DOJ's actions could potentially ruin what its users love about its phones and ecosystem. While the lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are notable differences in how the two companies retain customers. However, experts believe that a resolution to the lawsuit may take anywhere from three to five years.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft made headlines this week by acquiring the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman has now become the lead of Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan is the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its largest investor.

Nvidia also made waves with its GTC developer conference, where CEO Jensen Huang announced some surprising developments. Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would become a reality within the next five years and unveiled a new AI platform for humanoid robots named GR00T. These announcements showcase Nvidia's continued commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI technology.

In other news, there are reports that Google and Apple are in talks to deploy Google's AI model on upcoming iOS updates. The implications of this potential partnership remain uncertain, but it raises questions about whether it's a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up or a long-term collaboration.

Turning our attention to hacking and privacy concerns, the Biden administration is leading an international coalition against commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors backing this initiative were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against. This development highlights the need for greater accountability and regulation in the tech industry.

Additionally, a recent hacking incident disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament, with the hackers claiming it was done for fun and to expose a vulnerability to the game's developers. This incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges posed by cybersecurity threats in the gaming community.

Glassdoor, a popular platform for employee reviews, faced criticism this week as users reported their real names being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to affected users was to delete their accounts entirely. This raises concerns about privacy and the need for better safeguards when it comes to online platforms.

Moving on to funding and IPO updates, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the company's stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced a successful IPO, with its stock closing at $62.03 on the first day.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, recently raised $50 million in funding. The company's ambitious goal is to replace PCs with browsers, but its path to monetization remains unclear despite numerous feature launches and AI updates.

In our bonus round, we explore the limitations of AI when it comes to spelling. Despite its potential, AI still struggles with spelling, as evidenced by some AI-generated images. We delve into the reasons behind this and the challenges that AI developers face in improving this aspect of AI technology.

In another bonus piece, Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, announced a temporary pause in production due to financial constraints. The company's future operations depend on its ability to secure additional capital.

Lastly, we examine the importance of reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini, despite the inherent challenges in doing so. While it may be difficult to fully review these systems, it remains crucial to put them to the test in order to understand their capabilities and limitations.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. We hope you found these updates informative and engaging.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/why-its-impossible-to-review-ais-and-why-techcrunch-is-doing-it-anyway/,"Why it's impossible to review AIs, and why TechCrunch is doing it anyway", The Challenge of Evaluating AI Models: TechCrunch's Approach ,"Every week, it seems like there's a new AI model being released. However, evaluating these models comprehensively has become nearly impossible due to their frequency and complexity. In this article, we will explore why evaluating AI models is challenging, the importance of attempting to do so, and our evolving approach to the task.

The rapid pace of AI model releases makes it difficult for anyone other than dedicated experts to thoroughly assess their strengths and weaknesses. At TechCrunch, we receive news of new or updated models on a daily basis. While we take note of their characteristics, the sheer volume of information is overwhelming. Additionally, the release levels, access requirements, platforms, and code bases associated with each model create a complex web of information to navigate. It's like trying to boil the ocean.

Fortunately, our readers are primarily interested in top-line models and major releases. Models like Vicuna-13B, while interesting to researchers and developers, are not commonly used for everyday purposes like ChatGPT or Gemini. This allows us to focus our evaluation efforts on the models that have significant impact and relevance to users.

However, even narrowing down the models for evaluation presents a challenge. These large AI models are not simple software or hardware that can be easily tested and scored. They are complex platforms with multiple individual models and services integrated into them. For example, when you ask Gemini for directions to a good Thai restaurant, it doesn't just consult its training data for an answer. Instead, it queries various Google services and sub-models to provide a response. The chat interface is merely a new front-end for a vast array of AI-powered and non-AI-powered services.

This means that the Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude we review today may not be the same version you use tomorrow. And because companies like Google and OpenAI are secretive about their updates, we don't always know when or how these changes occur. A review criticizing a certain aspect of Gemini Pro may become outdated if Google quietly updates a sub-model or adds secret tuning instructions that improve its performance.

Now imagine this complexity multiplied by a hundred thousand tasks. These AI systems can be asked to do almost anything, even tasks their creators didn't anticipate or design them for. This makes it impossible to exhaustively test them, as even millions of daily users can't fully explore their capabilities and limitations. Developers of these models constantly encounter unexpected functions and edge cases.

Furthermore, these companies closely guard their internal training methods and databases as trade secrets. However, auditing and inspecting mission-critical processes is essential for building trust. We still don't know, for example, if OpenAI used pirated books to train ChatGPT. Google's image model also raised eyebrows when it diversified a group of 18th-century slave owners. While we may get non-apology statements from these companies, they rarely provide full transparency.

Does this mean AI models can't be evaluated at all? Not necessarily, but it's not a straightforward process. Imagine an AI model as a multi-talented baseball player. While they may excel in various areas like cooking, singing, or coding, what most people care about is their ability to hit, field, and run. These skills are crucial to the game and can be easily quantified.

Similarly, AI models can perform a wide range of tasks, but many of them are merely parlor tricks or niche applications. Only a handful of tasks are relevant to the daily lives of millions of users. It is these tasks that should be the focus of evaluation efforts. To that end, we have a carefully curated set of criteria and methodologies in place to assess the real-world performance of AI models.

In conclusion, evaluating AI models is a complex task due to their rapid releases, extensive capabilities, and opaque nature. However, it is crucial to attempt evaluations as a counterbalance to industry hype. While our reviews may be limited and inconsistent, they provide a qualitative analysis that adds value and serves as a reality check. We prioritize evaluating the models that have the most impact on users' lives and employ a rigorous methodology to ensure accuracy and fairness.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-robot-phrenology-v4.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 13:01:15,Discover the challenges of evaluating AI models and why it's important.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/03/23/apple-iphone-16-pro-ios-18-ai-china-baidu-google-gemini/,Apple’s Latest AI Move Is Vital To Find iPhone Success, Apple Partners with Google and Baidu for AI Integration ,"

As Apple gears up to unveil its plans for integrating AI into the iPhone, it appears that the tech giant is forging a potential partnership not only with Google but also with China's Baidu. This collaboration could help Apple catch up with its Android competitors in terms of generative AI capabilities.

While Android smartphones have been incorporating generative AI into their flagship devices, Apple's iPhone 15 family has lagged behind in this aspect. Although AI features can be found in Apple's software, such as image processing and predictive text input, generative AI is expected to be introduced in the next version of iOS, which is anticipated to be released at the Worldwide Developer Conference this summer. This new iOS version will likely be available on the upcoming iPhone 16 family.

Like other smartphone manufacturers, Apple will focus on both on-device and cloud-based AI processing. Apple's commitment to prioritizing local processing and keeping data on the device aligns with its reputation for privacy and security. However, for AI applications that require extensive processing, Apple will need to leverage the power of the cloud.

To address this need, Apple is reportedly exploring a partnership with Google and its Gemini generative AI service. Despite the fact that Google drives the adoption of the rival Android OS, Apple and Google have collaborated in various areas, such as making Google the default search engine on Apple devices. This collaboration could be mutually beneficial, as Google could tap into Apple's vast user base of AI-enabled iPhone owners, while Apple could utilize Google's advanced AI technology. Forbes writer David Phelan delves deeper into this potential partnership.

However, Google's Gemini is currently unavailable in China due to factors like coal regulations and government regulations on generative AI modems. As a result, Apple is in talks with China's Baidu to incorporate its cloud-based AI services into iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 family, as reported by The Wall Street Journal's Raffaele Huang. Baidu, known as the ""Google of China,"" could provide an alternative solution for AI services in the Chinese market.

Apple is not the only company taking this approach. During the recent Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S24 family, which also features Galaxy AI services that partly rely on Google's Gemini. Additionally, Samsung has partnered with Baidu to offer AI services in China.

It will be interesting to see how Apple differentiates its AI services from those of its competitors, considering they are built on similar technology foundations. The technical nuances and unique features Apple brings to the table will play a crucial role in setting its AI offerings apart.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/liquid-death-vc-beverage-startup-coke-pepsi/,Liquid Death is just one of many VC-backed beverage startups ready to disrupt Coke and Pepsi, Liquid Death: Disrupting Beverage Industry ,"

Liquid Death: The Disruptor in the Beverage Industry

In a world dominated by industry giants like Coke and Pepsi, a new player has emerged to shake up the beverage market. Liquid Death, a canned water company, has made waves by raising an impressive $267 million in venture funding. What makes this startup so intriguing is its ability to disrupt an industry that doesn't typically attract much investor interest.

The beverage industry is notoriously challenging for venture capitalists. It requires significant capital investment, a keen eye for consumer trends, and the ability to cultivate repeat customers. However, Liquid Death has managed to capture the attention of investors like Science Ventures, who see the brand's potential to challenge legacy players.

Michael Jones, the managing director of Science Ventures, explained why his firm decided to back Liquid Death: ""We were in the market for culturally relevant companies with better-for-you products that redefined a tired and old category."" Jones and his team recognized Liquid Death as a super disruptive brand with the power to revolutionize the industry.

But Liquid Death is not the only VC-backed beverage startup aiming to disrupt the market. Many startups are taking a similar approach by creating new drink categories. These companies draw inspiration from other industries and leverage innovative technologies to carve out their own niche. By doing so, they can generate substantial revenue and capture a significant market share.

One example is Not Beer, a premium sparkling water brand set to launch on April 9. Founder Dillon Dandurand noticed a growing trend among Gen Z consumers who are drinking less alcohol. Not Beer aims to provide a healthier alternative for those who still want to have fun without the need for excessive alcohol consumption. Dandurand believes that there is a massive potential for non-alcoholic brands that offer a similar experience to traditional alcoholic beverages.

Standing out in a crowded market is no easy feat. According to Dandurand, two key attributes differentiate successful brands: taste and brand identity. With so many options available, companies need to convince consumers that their product is superior both within its category and compared to other categories. This requires a strategic marketing approach and a strong value proposition.

It's not just water-based startups that are attracting VC dollars. Companies that incorporate vitamins, minerals, supplements, and botanicals into their beverages are also gaining traction. Odyssey, for instance, secured $6 million in venture capital funding for its drinks infused with lion's mane and cordyceps mushrooms, known for their cognitive and energy-boosting properties. Similarly, better-for-you soda startups like Olipop and Poppi have raised over $50 million in venture funding each. Lemon Perfect, a healthy lemonade alternative, has raised an impressive $70 million from a diverse group of investors, including VC firms, athletes, and celebrities.

Poppi, which boasts a 19% market share since its launch four years ago, is a prime example of a startup that has successfully disrupted the beverage market. With backing from CAVU Consumer Partners and celebrity investors like Russell Westbrook and Olivia Munn, Poppi has managed to carve out a significant portion of the market for itself.

In conclusion, the beverage industry is ripe for disruption, and VC-backed startups like Liquid Death are leading the charge. By offering innovative products, leveraging new technologies, and tapping into consumer trends, these companies are challenging the status quo and capturing the attention of investors and consumers alike. With the right combination of taste, branding, and market positioning, these startups have the potential to reshape the industry for years to come.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’, Unforgettable Total Solar Eclipses: Debunking Misconceptions ,"If you believe you have witnessed a total solar eclipse, think again. This common misconception among many people is rarely accurate. Before a total solar eclipse takes place, there is often widespread anticipation and excitement about the rare celestial event. However, the truth is that most individuals who claim to have seen a total solar eclipse are actually misremembering. What they likely witnessed was a partial solar eclipse, which occurs twice a year across large portions of the planet.

To truly experience totality, when the sun is completely blocked by the moon, is an unforgettable event. It is not something that is easily forgotten or vaguely remembered years later. Instead, it is a cherished memory that lasts a lifetime. Additionally, witnessing a total solar eclipse usually requires significant effort. One must be located within the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon entirely obscures the sun. If you are not within this path, you will only witness a partial solar eclipse. Therefore, if you are unsure whether you have seen a total solar eclipse, eclipse chasers will immediately question the validity of your claim.

However, it is worth noting that many people in North America have indeed had the opportunity to witness a total solar eclipse. In fact, the continent is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses. The most recent notable event was the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017, which brought totality to 12 U.S. states spanning from Oregon to South Carolina. Approximately 12 million people lived within this path, and an additional one million individuals traveled to be a part of the experience. If you were fortunate enough to be within this path, you would remember the breathtaking twilight-like sky, the silhouette of the moon, and the awe-inspiring sight of the sun's radiant corona. Witnessing such an event is undoubtedly one of life's most cherished memories.

If you are uncertain about whether you have witnessed a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify your memory. Often, individuals who believe they saw a total solar eclipse in school or at work can recall using solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras. It is highly likely that these memories are from the 2017 partial solar eclipse that was visible across North America. However, there have been other solar eclipses within living memory on the continent. To confirm the authenticity of your memory, you can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database and verify the location of the event.

For your convenience, here is a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America within the last 70 years, according to GreatAmericanEclipse.com. Each link provides an interactive map to help you determine if you were within the path of totality on specific dates. If the dates are not listed, it means that it was a partial solar eclipse rather than a total one.

When you encounter someone who believes they have seen a total solar eclipse, it can be enlightening to ask them about the specifics of their experience. Inquire about the date, location, and their recollection of totality. However, be prepared to gently inform them that a truly remarkable event is set to occur on April 8, 2024. This date marks a once-in-a-lifetime total eclipse of the sun, where they will have the opportunity to finally experience totality and achieve something that very few humans ever do. The best part is that this time, it will be a shared experience for an astounding 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, who already reside within the path of totality.

On April 8, 2024, everyone in North America will witness a partial solar eclipse. However, only those located within a narrow 115-mile path that spans parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will have the privilege of experiencing totality. This path will traverse five states in Mexico (Sinaloa, Nayarit, Durango, Coahuila, and Chihuahua), 15 U.S. states (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee (northwest corner), Michigan (southeast corner), Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine), and six Canadian provinces (Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland).

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent, UFC Fighter Disqualified for Biting Opponent ,"Pressure and combat sports can push athletes to do unthinkable things. The most recent shocking incident occurred during UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas. In his debut UFC fight, Igor Severino, a Brazilian fighter, resorted to biting his opponent, Andre Lima, in the second round of their preliminary bout.

This disgraceful act resulted in Severino's disqualification, as clear images confirmed the presence of bite marks on Lima's arm. The incident took place while Severino was grappling with Lima from behind in a standing position. It was an unfortunate turn of events for Severino, as this act will undoubtedly make it difficult for him to regain a place in the promotion.

Severino, who is only 20 years old, had the opportunity to establish himself in the UFC. However, his actions on Saturday night have tarnished his reputation. The defeat against Lima was Severino's first loss, bringing his record to 9-1. On the other hand, Lima remained undefeated at 8-0.

The immediate response from UFC CEO Dana White was to cut Severino from the promotion. White expressed his disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you get frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but the worst thing you can do is bite your opponent. Now, you get cut and lose the biggest opportunity of your life. Not to mention, he’s going to have real problems with the NSAC."" Severino's biting incident not only cost him his UFC career but also raised concerns with the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

Biting is not a new phenomenon in combat sports, but it remains an egregious act every time it occurs. Remarkably, Lima displayed an unusual level of composure despite being bitten. He calmly informed the referee about the incident, initiating a brief investigation into the violation.

Severino now faces the daunting task of rebuilding his reputation with smaller promotions before he can even consider competing in the UFC, Professional Fighters League, or any other reputable mixed martial arts organization. It will require time, effort, and a strong commitment to demonstrate his remorse and dedication to fair competition.

As the UFC Fight Night event in Las Vegas concludes, stay tuned for more traditional results and updates. The biting incident may have marred the evening, but there are still plenty of exciting fights and stories to come out of this event.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,"Meta Description: ""UFC fighter disqualified for biting opponent in debut fight.

But before we dive into that, I have a confession to make: I have a secret desire to make rabbit pot pies on Easter. The irony of it all would perfectly complement the savory dish. But for now, let's focus on Wordle and unravel its mysteries.

First things first, let me share some hints and clues for today's Wordle. The hint is that it's useful when dry but useless when wet. And here's a clue: the word begins with a consonant. Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of solving today's Wordle.

<h3>Wordle Analysis</h3>
Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. It's always exciting to see if my guesses were on point. If you want to check your Wordles, you can use Wordle Bot too. Just head over to their website.

Now, let me take you through my journey of guessing today's Wordle phrase. My initial guess was ""chain,"" which left me with a whopping 681 words to narrow down. Thankfully, I managed to bring that number down to a more manageable 19 with the word ""slope."" Feeling hopeful, I decided to go with ""below"" as my final guess. It wasn't a bad choice, considering it sounded like a good fit. And guess what? It worked! Coincidence? Perhaps, but it was a satisfying moment nonetheless.

<h3>Competitive Wordle Score</h3>
Unfortunately, today's Wordle didn't earn me any points. My guess in four was a total wash, and I couldn't tie with the Bot. Zeroes all around! But that won't deter me from trying again tomorrow.

Today's Wordle Etymology
Now, let's delve into the fascinating origins of the word ""towel."" It traces its roots back to the Old French term ""touaille,"" which entered the English language around the 13th century. This Old French word is believed to have derived from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which itself likely originated from the Latin word ""tubicula."" ""Tubicula"" is a diminutive form of ""tuba,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of the word reflects its significance in daily life, initially referring to a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping.

The transformation from ""touaille"" in Old French to ""towel"" in English showcases the linguistic influences of Norman French on the English language following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Over time, many words of French origin underwent pronunciation and spelling changes as they became Anglicized. Thus, we have the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Towels have been an essential item in households for centuries, evolving in material and usage, but their fundamental purpose remains the same: drying or wiping.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-vlogger-ai-model-can-generate-video-avatars-from-images-what-could-go-wrong/,Google's VLOGGER AI model can generate video avatars from images - what could go wrong?, Google's VLOGGER AI: Generating Realistic Video Avatars ,"VLOGGER is an advanced tool developed by Google that can create high-quality video clips using just a single photograph. It goes beyond previous ""talking head"" software by accurately portraying facial expressions and body movements, down to the smallest details like blinking. The question that arises is, what should we do with these videos?

In response to this question, Enric Corona and his team at Google Scholar have come up with an answer: control them using VLOGGER. This tool can generate a high-resolution video of a person speaking based on a single photograph. What's even more impressive is that VLOGGER can animate the video according to a speech sample, creating a controlled likeness of a person, essentially an ""avatar"" of high fidelity.

The potential applications of VLOGGER are vast. On a simple level, Corona's team suggests that VLOGGER could greatly impact helpdesk avatars by creating more realistic-looking synthetic talking humans that can develop empathy. They also propose that this technology could enable new use cases such as enhanced online communication, education, or personalized virtual assistants.

However, there is also the concern that VLOGGER could contribute to the rise of deepfakes, which are realistic-looking videos of people saying and doing things they never actually did. Corona's team acknowledges this concern and intends to provide supplementary materials addressing the societal implications of VLOGGER. Unfortunately, these materials are not currently available on the project's GitHub page.

To understand the significance of VLOGGER, it's important to consider the limitations of existing video avatars. Most avatars only show the face, cropping out the body and hands. They also have limited variations in facial expressions and poses, resulting in rudimentary lip-syncing. VLOGGER, on the other hand, can generate high-resolution videos of head and upper-body motion with diverse facial expressions and gestures. It is the first approach to generate talking and moving humans based on speech inputs.

The goal of Corona's team is to achieve automation and behavioral realism with VLOGGER. They aim to create a multi-modal interface that combines audio and animated visual representation to support natural conversations with a human user. Using a process called ""diffusion,"" VLOGGER predicts the frames of video that should accompany each moment of a sound file based on a single photograph. It then generates those frames in high-definition quality.

VLOGGER incorporates several recent trends in deep learning. It leverages multi-modality by integrating text, audio, images, and video. It takes advantage of large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 to use natural language as input for various actions. Additionally, it utilizes the concept of diffusion, which involves introducing noise into an image and reconstructing the original image to train a neural network. This technique has been successfully applied in image-generation processes.

To achieve its results, Corona's team trained a neural network to associate a speaker's audio with individual frames of video. They used the Transformer, a recent innovation, along with the diffusion process to predict video frames based on past frames and audio. This combination allows the neural network to learn and render accurate actions.

In conclusion, VLOGGER represents a significant advancement in video generation technology. Its ability to create realistic videos from a single photograph opens up new possibilities for communication, education, and virtual assistants. However, it also raises concerns about the potential misuse of deepfake technology. As the development of VLOGGER progresses, it is crucial to consider the societal implications and ensure responsible use of this powerful tool.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/0aa845e6caa6ed820cc93f8f6f5c66a2d0dc2096/2024/03/20/21d12fd0-6e03-45d0-b9a3-0376729be898/google-2024-vlogger-spalsh-image.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-23 11:45:00,"Meta Description: Experience the rise of video avatars with Google's VLOGGER AI model.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse, The Difference Between Solar and Lunar Eclipses ,"Do you know the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the next few weeks, we will witness two remarkable celestial events—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Although these phenomena differ greatly, they both arise from a similar celestial alignment.

Let's start with the lunar eclipse. This occurs when Earth's shadow casts onto the moon, resulting in a captivating display. On the other hand, a solar eclipse takes place when the moon obstructs the sun's light, casting a shadow on Earth. Despite their dissimilarities, both types of eclipses are rare due to the slight variation in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon around the sun.

So, what causes a lunar eclipse? A lunar eclipse can only occur during a full moon when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. While full moons occur every 29 days, it is uncommon for the moon to pass through Earth's shadow. When this rare event does transpire, it is referred to as a lunar eclipse.

Now, let's delve into the reasons behind a solar eclipse. A solar eclipse exclusively occurs during a new moon, when the moon aligns itself between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow onto our planet. New moons occur every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon, but it is infrequent for the moon to block the sun's rays from Earth's perspective. When this extraordinary occurrence takes place, it is known as a solar eclipse.

What causes a total lunar eclipse? A total lunar eclipse is a result of a perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth possesses two shadows—a fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and a dark central umbral shadow. When a full moon ventures into Earth's umbral shadow, it receives no direct light from the sun. The only illumination on the lunar surface emanates from sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. As a consequence, the moon's appearance transforms into a mesmerizing pinkish-red hue, resembling a thousand simultaneous sunsets. If one were to stand on the moon during a lunar eclipse, they would be immersed in this enchanting pinkish-red light, witnessing a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will observe a penumbral lunar eclipse as the full ""Worm Moon"" traverses through Earth's penumbra.

Now, let's turn our attention to a total solar eclipse. A total solar eclipse materializes due to a flawless alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, along with a celestial serendipity. During a new moon, two shadows are cast—the fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When the new moon impeccably obstructs the entire sun, a rare occurrence facilitated by its size (400 times smaller than the sun) and proximity to Earth (400 times closer), its umbral shadow is projected onto our planet.

This shadow of the moon gracefully glides across Earth's surface as a result of its west to east orbit, which aligns with Earth's rotation. This synchronization between the moon's shadow and Earth's movement creates an umbral shadow, commonly known as the path of totality. Those lucky enough to find themselves within this path will witness an awe-inspiring phenomenon—a total eclipse of the sun. To exemplify, if one were standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse, they would observe the moon's shadow traversing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will transpire as the new ""Pink Moon"" impeccably blocks the sun, projecting an umbral shadow over North America.

Why are lunar and solar eclipses considered rare events? Eclipses, in general, are relatively infrequent due to the moon's inclined orbit around Earth. This inclination, approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path, causes the moon's trajectory to intersect with the sun's path twice during each orbit—roughly every month. However, for an eclipse to occur, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This specific scenario transpires twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" when solar and lunar eclipses take place. Nonetheless, the majority of solar eclipses are either partial or annular, featuring a captivating ""ring of fire"" effect. Similarly, most lunar eclipses are either penumbral or partial.

Let's explore the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024 and 2025. In 2024, there will be two ""eclipse seasons,"" commencing on March 25 and September 17:

- March 25, 2024: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8, 2024: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17, 2024: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- October 2, 2024: Annular solar eclipse (visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America)

Moving on to 2025, we can anticipate two ""eclipse seasons"" beginning on March 13 and September 7:

- March 13, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- March 29, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
- September 7, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
- September 21, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing, Mallard Bay: The Online Marketplace and SaaS Platform for Guided Hunting and Fishing ,"Americans have a deep love for fishing and hunting, with a staggering $144.8 billion spent on these activities in 2022 alone, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, the booking process for guided hunting and fishing trips has remained outdated and offline, relying on phone calls and physical payments. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this industry by providing an online marketplace for consumers to easily find and book these guided tours, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, Mallard Bay offers a vertical SaaS platform for outfitters to manage their back office operations and access marketing services.

Recently, Mallard Bay announced a successful Series A funding round, raising $4.6 million. The round was led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. The idea for Mallard Bay came to co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux after a disappointing hunting trip with his father during his college years. They arrived at their destination only to discover that their hunt had been double-booked, leaving them with limited options and ultimately no success. This experience inspired Meaux to create a solution for others to avoid similar mishaps.

Initially, Mallard Bay aimed to build a marketplace similar to Airbnb for booking guided hunts. However, after consulting with outfitters and guides, they realized they needed to offer more to entice these professionals to join the platform. This led to the development of Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back office solution for outfitters. Many outfitters were receptive to the idea of transitioning to an online platform but lacked the business expertise to do so. Mallard Bay bridged this gap by providing domain expertise and guiding outfitters through the transition.

The platform gained significant traction after hunting influencer Toby Brohlin joined, resulting in more outfitters signing up. Brohlin alone has booked over $1 million in gross bookings, contributing to Mallard Bay's total of over $6 million in gross bookings in 2023. The company is projected to reach $30 million to $35 million in gross bookings in 2024.

Despite the promising market size and Mallard Bay's success, Meaux faced challenges in securing investors for the company. They approached over 270 investors before closing the Series A round. The difficulty stemmed from investors' lack of understanding of the hunting and fishing industry and its potential. Additionally, the founders had to dispel negative perceptions surrounding hunting and emphasize the company's commitment to ethical practices and conservation.

Conservation is a critical aspect of hunting and fishing, as responsible practices ensure the preservation of wildlife for future generations. Mallard Bay recognizes this and aims to promote sustainable wildlife management. By instilling these values in their platform, they hope to educate the public and change the narrative surrounding hunting and fishing.

As someone not actively involved in hunting or fishing, Mallard Bay's success still caught my attention due to the unique concept of a hunting SaaS platform. It's not often that we hear about hunting or fishing in the startup and tech ecosystem. However, Mallard Bay's growth since its launch in 2021 is impressive. With a 600% year-over-year increase in bookings, the company has defied expectations in a seemingly niche market. This further emphasizes the potential of niche markets, as they often hold untapped opportunities.

Outdoor activities, including hunting and fishing, contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, with over $394 billion spent in these sectors. However, many of these industries still rely on outdated offline practices or subpar technology. This was evident in my recent experience trying to find parking for a popular hiking trail in Sedona, Arizona. The lack of streamlined information and technology made the process frustrating and inefficient.

Mallard Bay's success and the broader outdoor industry's potential highlight the need for innovative solutions and improved technology. By embracing online platforms and leveraging advanced tech, these industries can enhance the customer experience and drive further growth. Mallard Bay is leading the charge in transforming the guided hunting and fishing sector, and their journey serves as an inspiration for other startups to explore niche markets and disrupt traditional industries.

In conclusion, Mallard Bay is revolutionizing the hunting and fishing industry by providing an online marketplace for consumers to book guided tours and a comprehensive back office solution for outfitters. Their recent Series A funding round and impressive growth highlight the untapped potential in this niche market. By promoting ethical practices and conservation, Mallard Bay aims to change the public perception of hunting and fishing. The success of Mallard Bay serves as a reminder of the opportunities that lie in niche markets and the importance of leveraging technology to enhance traditional industries.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Revolutionize hunting and fishing with Mallard Bay's online marketplace and back office solution.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/03/23/the-invisible-shield-aims-to-makes-public-health-more-visible/,‘The Invisible Shield’ Aims To Makes Public Health More Visible," ""The Invisible Shield: Shedding Light on Public Health"" ","There’s a common saying that offensive linemen in football don’t receive much recognition unless they make mistakes. The same can be said about public health. That's why a new TV series called ""The Invisible Shield"" aims to bring more visibility to the importance of public health. Premiering on PBS on March 26 at 10 pm, this four-episode series sheds light on the often overlooked work of the public health system and its professionals.

The title ""The Invisible Shield"" refers to the fact that while the public health system works tirelessly to protect everyone from various health threats, it often goes unnoticed. Instead, there is more focus on celebrity news, politics, and unnecessary products. As Dr. Kelly Henning, Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, points out, ""The better public health works, the less likely you are to see it."" Unfortunately, this invisible shield has been eroding for years, and most people are unaware of it due to the system's invisible nature.

The Covid-19 pandemic should have exposed the chronic underfunding, underappreciation, and vulnerability of public health systems. With more resources and support, countless lives could have been saved, and suffering reduced. However, political and business leaders only briefly acknowledged this before reverting to their own interests. In fact, some leaders worsened the situation by spreading misinformation and disinformation about public health. While the pandemic briefly shed some positive attention on public health, the necessary resources did not follow suit. So, what will it take for society to realize the urgent need for stronger support for the public health system? Should we wait for an even bigger disaster than Covid-19 to strike before taking action? That would be akin to waiting for a building to burn down before considering installing smoke alarms and fire extinguishers.

To avoid waiting for another catastrophe, RadicalMedia produced ""The Invisible Shield"" with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. The series aims to bring more attention to public health, which often gets lost amidst the constant self-promotion of celebrities, influencers, politicians, and businesses. By highlighting the significant impact of public health in our lives, the series reminds viewers of its essential contributions. Just think, without public health accomplishments like vaccinations, antibiotics, clean water supplies, and anti-pollution efforts, many of us may not be here today to buy into all the hype and products. As Dr. Josh Sharfstein, Distinguished Professor of the Practice at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, states in the trailer for ""The Invisible Shield,"" ""Public health saved your life today, but you didn't even know it.""

Of course, four episodes cannot fully encompass all that public health has accomplished over the years. Even the 2021 Justice League movie, directed by Zack Snyder, was four hours and two minutes long (although it felt even longer). The first episode of ""The Invisible Shield"" titled ""The Old Playbook"" explores how public health has contributed to doubling life expectancy since 1900. It also addresses the current risks and challenges facing the public health system. The episode delves into how the lessons learned from previous epidemics and pandemics were applied in response to Covid-19.

As the series unfolds, viewers will gain a deeper understanding of the critical role public health plays in our lives. It serves as a reminder that public health is not just a fleeting concern during a crisis but an essential component of our well-being. ""The Invisible Shield"" invites us to appreciate the tireless efforts of public health professionals and to support the system that protects us all. So, mark your calendars for March 26 and tune in to PBS at 10 pm to witness the unveiling of the invisible shield that has been quietly safeguarding our health for years.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08,"Watch ""The Invisible Shield"" on PBS at 10 pm on March 26.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,These ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization, ADHD Medications Lower Suicide & Hospitalization Risk ,"<h3>ADHD Medications Associated with Lower Risk of Suicide and Psychiatric Hospitalizations
</h3>
A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who are prescribed ADHD stimulant medications have a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included 221,714 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also revealed that the use of ADHD medications is associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers, led by Heidi Taipale, examined the data of individuals who had been diagnosed with ADHD between 2006 and 2021 in Sweden. They analyzed the participants' healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register, as well as information from the Prescribed Drug Register to track their use of prescribed ADHD medications.

The study found that four ADHD medications were linked to a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations due to co-morbidities: amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate. However, the decreased risk of suicidal behavior was only associated with the use of lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate.

According to a previous study conducted in Sweden in 2019, the prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD is 52%, compared to only 7% among individuals without ADHD. Psychiatric co-morbidities include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. The 2019 study also reported that psychiatric co-morbidity increases the risk of mortality among people with ADHD, especially when substance use disorder is involved.

While the study did not find a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior associated with atomoxetine, it did find an association between atomoxetine and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers emphasized that ADHD medications, especially stimulants, not only improve ADHD symptoms but also have a positive impact on overall functioning and quality of life. However, they also acknowledged that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies.

It is worth noting that there are concerns about the potential adverse effects of long-term stimulant use, such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. There is also a concern about the increased risk of seizures, psychosis, or mania associated with these medications.

In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that ADHD medications, specifically lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate, are associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. The findings highlight the importance of medication management in the treatment of ADHD and its associated co-morbidities.

The study was published online on JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024. The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to a better understanding of the benefits and risks of ADHD medications and ultimately improve the care and outcomes for individuals with ADHD.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,"Meta Description: Lower suicide and hospitalization risk associated with ADHD medications.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone, Google's Surprise Android Update Beats iPhone ,"Android and iPhone are in constant competition, with each operating system striving to offer the best features and user experience. Recently, Google has been making efforts to make Android more like the iPhone, and it seems to have succeeded with its latest update. In fact, Google has not only matched an existing iPhone feature but has gone even further, surpassing Apple in the process.

Previously, I discussed Google's plan to introduce an emergency satellite service as a new feature for Android. This feature allows Android to catch up to the satellite SOS functionality that has been available on iPhones for a few years. But Google's offering goes beyond just matching Apple's feature. It includes a Garmin rescue service that enhances the safety and security of Android users.

However, one limitation of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only useful in emergencies. For those who don't engage in extreme activities like mountain climbing or sailing, the feature remains unused. But with the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google aims to bridge this gap. The update allows users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, enabling core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network. This means no more dropped calls or loss of connectivity in cellular black spots.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. Additionally, the update includes a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. This expansion of platform support for satellite connectivity is a significant development. Some networks already have plans to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option.

While Apple also offers satellite connectivity, it remains more limited compared to Android. Apple allows iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, or iPhone 15 Pro users to connect their devices to a satellite for emergency texting, requesting roadside assistance, and sharing their location off the grid. Android, on the other hand, has the potential to go even further. Previous beta code hinted at a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further fueled speculation about the future of satellite connectivity.

While direct phone-to-satellite connectivity might become more common in the future, messaging integration is a great starting point. The fact that this feature is coming to Android 15 confirms its imminent arrival, assuming there are no major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, it appears that Google is taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes on the heels of reports that Gemini, Google's AI workhorse, could be coming to iPhone, potentially closing the gap even further.

In summary, Google's latest update for Android introduces satellite connectivity and messaging integration. This feature not only matches Apple's existing functionality but goes further in terms of usability and potential. As Android and iPhone become more similar, it is clear that Google is taking the lead in innovation, with Apple likely to follow suit. The future of smartphone connectivity looks promising, and users can look forward to enhanced features and experiences on both Android and iPhone devices.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,"Meta Description: ""Google's latest Android update introduces satellite connectivity, surpassing iPhone capabilities.
