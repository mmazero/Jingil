Summary:
General Galactic, co-founded by Halen Mattison and Luke Neise, aims to make e-fuels more accessible and affordable by designing and building the entire system in-house. By capturing CO2, producing hydrogen from water, and combining them to form methane using renewable power, they plan to minimize costs and transform the e-fuels industry.","Title: Revitalizing Childhood: Clarity Pediatrics Tackles ADHD and Chronic Conditions

In the United States, raising young children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) can be a daunting task. These children might struggle with schoolwork, display frequent emotional outbursts, or have trouble focusing. Seeking professional assistance often reveals a nationwide shortage of psychologists, leading to long wait times for diagnoses and therapy. Moreover, treatment costs can quickly escalate into thousands of dollars per year for families seeking out-of-network care.

Enter Clarity Pediatrics, a chronic care startup founded in 2021, aiming to transform the landscape of ADHD diagnosis and treatment for children aged five to twelve. By offering group therapy sessions for parents of newly or previously diagnosed kids, Clarity Pediatrics significantly reduces the waiting period from several months to just a few days, with an average $15 co-pay per session.

What makes Clarity Pediatrics unique is its reliance on behavioral parent training (BPT), which the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends for families with children suffering from mild-to-moderate ADHD. Since young kids aren't developmentally ready to change their behaviors independently, BPT empowers parents by equipping them with strategies and skills to help their children succeed in school and manage emotional outbursts. Christina LaMontagne, Clarity's CEO and co-founder, asserts, ""There is no evidence that one-to-one therapy is effective for young kids with ADHD.""

Over the past 18 months, Clarity Pediatrics has delivered online care to thousands of families in California. Utilizing $10 million in seed funding from investors such as Rethink Impact, Homebrew, and Maverick Ventures, the company plans to expand its services to other states in 2024.

Clarity Pediatrics is not alone in tackling the shortage of children's therapists. Startups like Brightline, Little Otter, and Bend Health offer online pediatric mental health services, including ADHD treatment. However, Clarity Pediatrics currently focuses on diagnosing, treating, and prescribing medication for ADHD in children aged five to twelve.

In today's digital age, an exciting shift is taking place in the realms of business and technology. IT professionals are becoming more business-savvy, while business pros are growing increasingly tech-savvy. This convergence has led to the emergence of a new breed of hybrid professionals – the citizen developers. This article will delve into the phenomenon of citizen developers, their benefits, and the role they play in the ever-evolving world of technology and business.

[THE RISE OF CITIZEN DEVELOPERS]

The increasing prevalence of citizen developers has been discussed by Tom Davenport and Ian Barkin in an MIT Sloan Management Review webcast and related article. These hybrid professionals, who possess knowledge of both business processes and technology, are poised to deliver and maintain IT functions. According to Davenport, ""IT and businesspeople are both converging toward the middle.""

Citizen developers bridge the gap between domain expertise and technological understanding. They understand the problems in supply chains and have a working knowledge of technology, enabling them to find solutions using available tools. This overlap between humans becoming more technical and technology becoming more user-friendly results in increased success rates for technology initiatives.

[GUARDRAILS FOR CITIZEN DEVELOPERS]

However, citizen developers are not equipped to handle tasks such as designing enterprise architecture or planning and maintaining infrastructure requirements. These responsibilities remain with software professionals, who provide guidance, plan strategically, and ensure the viability of business technology.

To ensure citizen developers work efficiently and securely, ""guardrails"" are built into systems. These guardrails include standards, security protocols, and scorecards. By making it easy to do the right thing, companies can create zone-based standards to manage risk and maintain control over applications.

[SKILL GAP AND AI SOLUTIONS]

Despite the rise of citizen developers, there is still a significant skill gap in the workforce. According to research, 60% of enterprises have a massive gap due to the rapid pace of technological change. Addressing this gap is crucial for the future, as there will be an impending shortage of 160 million tech workers.

Artificial intelligence (AI) may provide a solution to this challenge. AI can help create computing technology that doesn't require extensive",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/7a05f69a5a6f58c202e76a90db76c7ab4cdf960a/2024/04/22/4ac46b7e-1611-4206-8ae5-22c4e29f1817/itduogettyimages-1016895138.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-22 00:00:00,"""Empower Your Business with Tech-Savvy Pros: Boost Tech Initiatives & Fill Skill Gaps with AI Solutions"" - 17 words.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become an indispensable part of our daily lives, powering smartphones, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage systems. The key components of LIBs are lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, graphite anodes, and liquid electrolytes that facilitate the movement of ions between the electrodes. The electrolyte significantly impacts battery performance by governing the characteristics of the interphase layer that forms on the electrodes. However, most commercial electrolytes still rely on a lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)-based system formulated more than three decades ago.

Recent advancements in high-concentration electrolytes (> 3 mol/L) have shown promise in enhancing battery performance. These electrolytes promote the formation of robust inorganic-dominated interphase layers, which improve battery cycling performance. But they often suffer from high viscosity, poor wetting ability, and inferior conductivity, not to mention the high costs associated with large amounts of lithium salts.

To reduce costs, research has turned to ultralow-concentration electrolytes (< 0.3 mol/L). Unfortunately, these electrolytes tend to decompose more solvent than the few salt anions, resulting in an organic-dominated and less stable interphase layer. A new ultralow-concentration electrolyte, LiDFOB/EC-DMC, promises to overcome these challenges.

Led by researchers at Ningbo University (China) and the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras Campus (U.S.), this novel electrolyte comprises lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and a commercial carbonate solvent, EC-DMC. LiDFOB, a common additive and significantly cheaper than LiPF6, offers water and air stability, unlike LiPF6, which releases highly toxic and corrosive hydrogen fluoride gas (HF) in the presence of moisture.

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots have become increasingly popular, offering a wide range of applications for both personal and professional use. However, to harness the full potential of these AI chatbots, users must understand the art of AI prompting. Google, recognizing this need, recently introduced a blog series aimed at helping users master AI chatbots, with a particular focus on Gemini for Google Workspace. This article provides a summary of Google's tips and tricks, offering a comprehensive guide to mastering AI prompting.

The Importance of AI Prompting

An AI prompt is essentially a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. To maximize the benefits of generative AI, crafting effective prompts is crucial. Google outlines four key areas to consider when writing a prompt: persona, task, context, and format.

1. Persona
The persona refers to the individual or entity requesting the information. This could be a specific role, such as a marketing professional or a customer service representative. By defining the persona, you can tailor the prompt to better suit the required outcome.

2. Task
The task is the action you want the AI chatbot to perform. This could be anything from generating a report, drafting an email, or providing information on a specific topic. Clearly defining the task ensures the AI chatbot understands what is expected.

3. Context
Context involves any additional information that could assist the AI chatbot in completing the task. This could include details about the project, the audience, or the desired outcome. Providing context helps the AI chatbot to produce more accurate and relevant results.

4. Format
The format refers to how you want the output to be structured. This could be a bullet-point list, a paragraph, or a detailed report. Specifying the format ensures the AI chatbot presents the information in a way that is useful and easy to understand.

The Prompt Formula

Google's prompt formula encourages users to include as much detail as possible when crafting a prompt. This formula includes:

1. Role: Define the persona or role.
2. Goal: Describe the task or goal.
3. Context: Provide any relevant context or background information.
4. Format: Specify the desired output format.

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology, social robots are becoming increasingly prevalent. These robots are designed to interact with humans, yet the focus on their development has primarily been on design features, overlooking crucial sociological factors. A groundbreaking study by Cornell and Indiana University scholars specializing in human-robot interaction sheds light on this issue. The researchers argue that understanding the broader scope of communities around robots and human interactions is essential to creating truly social robots.

The Role of Interactions in Constructing Sociality

Malte Jung, a co-author and associate professor of information science, emphasizes that sociality is not merely about enhancing a robot's character or natural behavior. Instead, it is constructed through interactions between people around the machine. The contexts in which these interactions occur and the cultural norms involving robots play a significant role in shaping sociality.

The Social Life of Robots in Tokyo

Waki Kamino, the paper's lead author, conducted extensive fieldwork in Tokyo's robot-friendly culture. She discovered that social robots, such as Sony's Aibo, SHARP's RoBoHoN, and Groove X's LOVOT, have expansive communities of owners who regularly interact and socialize with their robots. These robots have become integral parts of their owners' social rituals, participating in activities like coffee dates and birthday parties.

Norms and Emotional Support

Kamino's research reveals that manufacturers and robot owners together establish new norms for robots as social agents. Companies incorporate familiar designs and bring owners together through sponsored events, while owners integrate robots into everyday interactions with friends and meet up regularly in public spaces. Moreover, robots provide emotional support to their owners. Some robots serve as companions for hospitalized individuals, while others replace living pets to minimize emotional risk.

Rethinking Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

The research team calls for a broader sociological view when designing and building robot companions. Traditionally, HRI research has focused on the interaction between one person and one robot. However, Kamino's work demonstrates that using robots is a social practice that involves multiple individuals. Interacting with robots can foster connections and",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/robot-friend.jpg,2024-04-22 11:24:04,Discover the sociological side of social robots: build stronger communities & interactions!

A few days ago, the tech world was abuzz with rumors about Salesforce acquiring Informatica, a data integration and management solutions provider. The potential deal was expected to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $15.7 billion, reminiscent of Salesforce's previous acquisitions of MuleSoft and Tableau. However, Informatica has recently released a statement confirming that it is not for sale, putting an end to the acquisition speculations.

Informatica's Official Statement

On Monday, Informatica released a press statement addressing the acquisition rumors. The company clarified that, despite the recent news articles claiming otherwise, it is not engaged in any acquisition discussions with any party. As per Informatica's policy, the company generally refrains from commenting on market rumors or media speculation. However, it chose to issue a statement to set the record straight and avoid any misinformation.

Rumor Analysis: Why the Deal Never Made Sense

The rumored acquisition did not seem like a perfect fit for either Informatica or Salesforce. According to Ray Wang, a principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, the deal would have been curious, given that Informatica's technology isn't cutting-edge, and Salesforce's Data Cloud offering is already a strong data integration solution.

Moreover, Salesforce has maintained its usual policy of not commenting on rumors or speculation, consistent with its approach in past situations.

What Informatica's Statement Means for the Future

Informatica's decision to publicly address the acquisition rumors shows that the company is keen on maintaining transparency with its stakeholders. This move is likely to strengthen Informatica's reputation as a reliable and honest company.

Furthermore, the denial of the acquisition rumors does not necessarily mean that Informatica is not open to future partnerships or collaborations. It merely signifies that the company is not currently in talks with any potential acquirers.

In conclusion, the rumored Informatica-Salesforce acquisition has been put to rest.

Linux kernel development is a dynamic and critical aspect of the open-source world. To stay updated on the latest developments, you can follow the Linux Kernel Mailing List or subscribe to Linux Weekly News (LWN). However, for a comprehensive yet condensed overview, attending a state-of-the-kernel presentation by Jonathan Corbet, a Linux kernel developer and LWN's editor-in-chief, is highly recommended.

At Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, Corbet provided an update on the Linux kernel, echoing Linus Torvalds' sentiments about the calm and steady nature of the upcoming Linux 6.9 kernel release. This stability is a positive sign, but there are still areas of concern.

One of the primary issues is the potential for exploitation of kernel bugs, which can lead to system vulnerabilities. Although this is not a new problem, the Linux kernel developers have recently started issuing their own Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) notifications. According to Corbet, since February alone, there have been around 800 new assigned CVEs.

To protect your Linux systems, it is essential to use long-term stable (LTS) kernel releases, which include fixed CVEs and receive patches for new issues. However, LTS releases will no longer be supported for six years, as was the case previously; instead, they will be supported for only two years. As of January 2024, Linux 4.14 was retired, and by 2026, only the two most recently released LTS versions will be supported.

To determine your current kernel version, run the following command from the shell:

$ uname -r

If you're using an LTS version, consider updating it regularly to ensure the security and safety of your Linux systems.

The decrease in use of older kernel versions and the practical difficulties of maintaining outdated software have led to the reduction in LTS support duration. This shift highlights the importance of using current versions, which are easier to support and secure.

For those attached to specific kernel versions, some Linux distribution builders, like Canonical and OpenELA, offer extended support. However, the future points to more frequent updates to keep your Linux machines secure and safe from potential security issues",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a5d0e57d7310a5079b4ad595588541e34b46844d/2024/04/22/c1bb2c7d-f3a7-4f8b-abd7-adb79dc88230/sleeping-penquingettyimages-128104898.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-22 00:00:00,"Stay updated: Protect your Linux systems with secure, stable kernel releases.
