https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-team-reconfigurable-photonic-architecture-lifelong.html,Research team develops reconfigurable photonic computing architecture for lifelong learning," Photonic Computing for Lifelong Learning: Overcoming ""Catastrophic Forgetting"" ","As AI tasks become increasingly complex and abundant, energy consumption has become a significant barrier to more widespread applications of today's heavy electronic deep neural models, especially in terminal/edge systems. The community is seeking next-generation computing modalities to overcome the physical constraints of electronics-based implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Photonic computing has emerged as a promising avenue for overcoming the limitations of electronics and improving energy efficiency, processing speed, and computational throughput by orders of magnitude. Such extraordinary properties have been exploited to construct application-specific optical architectures for solving fundamental mathematical and signal processing problems with performances far beyond those of existing electronic processors.
However, existing optical neural networks (ONNs) still suffer from ""catastrophic forgetting,"" which is the widespread problem of conventional computing systems that are prone to training new models that interfere with formerly learned knowledge, rapidly forgetting the expertise gained from previously learned tasks when trained on something new.
Such an approach fails to fully exploit the intrinsic properties in sparsity and parallelism of wave optics for photonic computing, which ultimately results in poor network capacity and scalability for multi-task learning.
In a recent paper published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of scientists, led by Professor Lu Fang from Sigma Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and co-workers have developed L2ONN, a reconfigurable photonic computing architecture for lifelong learning.
The unique characteristics of light, spatial sparsity, and multi-spectrum parallelism have been developed in photonic computing architecture for the first time, endowing ONNs with lifelong learning capability. Unlike existing ONNs that try to imitate ANN structures, the photonic lifelong learning of L2ONN is initially designed following the physical nature of light–matter interaction, to fully explore the functional and performance potentials of wave optics in photonic computing.
Benefiting from the proposed lifelong-learning optical computing architecture, experimental evaluations on free-space and on-chip architectures demonstrate that L2ONN shows its extraordinary learning capability on challenging tens-of-tasks, such as vision classification, voice recognition, and medical diagnosis, supporting various new environments.
L2ONN achieves up to 14 times larger capacity than existing optical neural networks, with an order of magnitude higher energy efficiency than the representative electronic artificial neural networks.
""Humans possess the unique ability to incrementally absorb, learn, and memorize knowledge. In particular, neurons and synapses perform work only when there are tasks to deal with, in which two important mechanisms participate: sparse neuron connectivity and parallelly task-driven neurocognition, together contribute to a lifelong memory consolidation and retrieval.
""Accordingly, in ONNs, these characteristic features can be naturally promoted from biological neurons to photonic neurons based on the intrinsic sparsity and parallelism properties of optical operators.
""An optical architecture imitating the structure and function of human brains demonstrates its potential to alleviate the aforementioned issues, which shows more advantages than electronic approaches in constructing a viable lifelong learning computing system.
""We have demonstrated the photonic lifelong learning provides a turnkey solution for large-scale real-life AI applications with unprecedented scalability and versatility. We anticipate that the proposed neuromorphic architecture will accelerate the development of more powerful photonic computing as critical support for modern advanced machine intelligence and towards beginning a new era of AI,"" stated the scientists.
In conclusion, photonic computing has emerged as a promising avenue for overcoming the limitations of electronics and improving energy efficiency, processing speed, and computational throughput by orders of magnitude. L2ONN, a reconfigurable photonic computing architecture for lifelong learning, has demonstrated its extraordinary learning capability on challenging tens-of-tasks, supporting various new environments.

On Tuesday, the White House released a policy memo that directed NASA to create a new time standard for the Moon by 2026. This new time reference, Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC), will help guide future lunar missions. The memo came as a 21st-century space race emerged between the US, China, Japan, India, and Russia.

NASA has been instructed to work with several government departments, including Commerce, Defense, State, and Transportation, to plan a strategy for implementing LTC by December 31, 2026. International cooperation will also be crucial, particularly with signatories of the Artemis Accords, a set of common principles that govern space exploration and operating principles. Although China and Russia are not part of the group, they have expressed interest in establishing their own time standards.

The memo highlights the importance of establishing a consistent definition of time among operators in space. This is critical for successful space situational awareness capabilities, navigation, and communications, all of which are foundational for interoperability across the US government and with international partners.

According to Einstein's theories of relativity, time changes relative to speed and gravity. Given the Moon's weaker gravity and movement differences between it and Earth, time moves slightly faster there. As the US and other countries plan Moon missions to research, explore, and eventually build bases for permanent residence, using a single standard will help them synchronize technology and missions requiring precise timing.

NASA's Artemis program aims to send crewed missions back to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s. The space agency has set a launch date of September 2025 for Artemis 2, which will fly around the Moon with four people onboard, and a launch date of 2026 for Artemis 3, which plans to put humans back on the Moon's surface.

In addition to the US, China aims to put astronauts on the Moon before 2030 as the world's two foremost global superpowers take their race to space. Although no other countries have announced crewed missions to the lunar surface, India, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, South Korea, and private companies have all demonstrated lunar ambitions in recent years.

Furthermore, establishing a lunar time standard will enable further scientific exploration, technological establishment, and resource mining. The Moon could also serve as a critical stop on the way to Mars. It could test technologies and provide fuel and supply needs for eventual human missions to the Red Planet.

In conclusion, the White House's policy memo directing NASA to create a new time standard for the Moon is a significant step towards establishing a consistent definition of time among operators in space. The new Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) will help guide future lunar missions, maintain resilience, and enable interoperability across the US government and with international partners.

Introduction

In today's world, where technology is rapidly evolving, the demand for high-performance, miniaturized electronic components is at an all-time high. Among these components, flexible mini-inductors have gained significant attention due to their potential role in improving device performance, reducing energy consumption, and enabling device miniaturization. A recent breakthrough in this field comes from a research team at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They have developed a game-changing mini-inductor based on amorphous alloys that offers both exceptional flexibility and high inductance, making it an ideal solution for low-frequency applications.

The Challenge with Conventional Inductors

Traditional inductors, typically made of non-magnetic materials such as copper, suffer from magnetic flux leakage. This leakage reduces the inductance density, which is detrimental for low-frequency applications. To address this issue, the NIMTE research team turned to Fe-based soft magnetic amorphous alloys as a promising alternative. These alloys exhibit excellent soft magnetic properties, making them an ideal choice for fabricating amorphous flexible mini-inductors.

The Power of Femtosecond Laser Technology

To craft the amorphous alloy ribbons with precision, the research team employed high-precision femtosecond laser ablation technology. This advanced method allowed them to create the mini-inductors without inducing crystallization of the amorphous alloys, ensuring that the intrinsic mechanical excellence of the alloys was preserved.

The Unique Advantages of Amorphous Flexible Mini-Inductors

The novel mini-inductor, crafted from amorphous alloys, significantly reduces magnetic leakage to less than 10-4 T. This dramatic reduction in leakage minimizes interference between electronic components, providing a cleaner and more efficient signal processing environment.

Moreover, the high permeability of amorphous alloys results in an impressive inductance density of approximately 280-390 nH/mm2.

In the quest for sustainable energy sources, the scientific community is constantly exploring innovative methods to enhance fuel production processes. One such method is electrocatalysis, which plays a crucial role in converting chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Electrocatalysis involves the use of catalysts to speed up electrochemical reactions without being consumed in the process. This technique is essential in devices like fuel cells and electrolyzers, where it enables the efficient transformation of fuels into electricity or water into hydrogen and oxygen, respectively.

However, traditional electrocatalysis methods often face a significant challenge: maximizing the transport of reactants to the catalyst's surface. This critical step is essential for achieving optimal reaction efficiency, which remains elusive in current clean energy solutions. To tackle this issue, a team of researchers led by Magalí Lingenfelder at EPFL has developed a novel approach that combines magnetic fields and electrocatalysis to enhance the efficiency of clean fuel production. Their research was published in Nature Communications.

The study demonstrates that surrounding catalysts with magnetic fields generates Lorentz forces, which, in turn, induce whirling motions that enhance the movement of reactants and products at the catalyst surface. This results in a more consistent and rapid reaction, overcoming limitations posed by reactant scarcity, a common hurdle in reactions like the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), critical for fuel cells.

To observe the movement of ions in real-time under a magnetic field, the researchers developed an advanced magneto-electrochemical setup. This setup enabled them to decouple the different effects and observe how magnetic forces can stir and enhance the movement of reactants around the catalyst, akin to creating miniature whirlpools. This process significantly improves the efficiency of reactions crucial for green hydrogen production, offering a promising avenue for advancing sustainable energy technologies.

The research team, led by Magalí Lingenfelder at EPFL, showcased a more than 50% boost in activity for the oxygen reduction reaction induced by magnetic fields on non-magnetic interfaces. This substantial increase in efficiency allows for the resolution of many fundamental controversies in the field, demonstrating the mechanisms and conditions needed for magnetic fields to enhance different electrocatalytic reactions involving gas products or reactants",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/study-shows-magnetic-f-1.jpg,2024-04-03 12:38:07,"Boost Clean Energy Production: Magnetic Fields Enhance Electrocatalysis - 50%+ increase in oxygen reduction reaction efficiency.

In a groundbreaking feat, scientists showcase multi-level recording with 3D magnetic medium, paving the way for enhanced hard disk drives. DataStorage Innovation","Title: A Breakthrough in Data Storage: Multi-level Recording with 3D Magnetic Recording Medium

In a significant breakthrough for the field of data storage, researchers from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University have demonstrated the potential of multi-level recording using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium. This innovation could pave the way for increased storage capacity and more cost-effective hard disk drives (HDDs) in the future.

Currently, data centers store vast amounts of data on HDDs that utilize perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) to store information at areal densities of approximately 1.5 Tbit/in2. However, to transition to higher areal densities, a high anisotropy magnetic recording medium consisting of FePt grains combined with heat-assisted laser writing is required. This method, known as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), can sustain areal recording densities of up to 10 Tbit/in2. Moreover, densities larger than 10 Tbit/in2 are feasible based on a new principle demonstrated by storing multiple recording levels of 3 or 4 compared to the binary level used in HDD technology.

The research team has successfully arranged the FePt recording layers three-dimensionally by fabricating lattice-matched, FePt/Ru/FePt multilayer films, with Ru as a spacer layer. Measurements of the magnetization reveal that the two FePt layers have different Curie temperatures. This discovery allows for three-dimensional recording by adjusting the laser power when writing.

The researchers also demonstrated the principle of 3D recording through recording simulations. They utilized a media model that mimics the microstructure and magnetic properties of the fabricated media. The three-dimensional magnetic recording method can increase recording capacity by stacking recording layers in three dimensions. This means that more digital information can be stored with fewer HDDs, leading to energy savings for data centers.

In the future, the researchers aim to develop processes to reduce the size of FePt grains, improve the orientation and magnetic anisotropy, and stack more FePt layers. The goal is to realize a media structure suitable for practical use as a high-density HDD. This innovative approach to data storage using a three-dimensional magnetic recording medium could revolutionize the industry and lead to significant advancements",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/proof-of-principle-dem.jpg,2024-04-04 11:00:33,"Discover the future of data storage with 3D Magnetic Recording: Increase capacity, save energy, and revolutionize the industry.

In today's fast-paced business world, data transformation and optimization have become essential tasks for many organizations. However, these challenges seem to increase with the growth of AI and cloud technologies. According to a recent Gartner poll, only 44% of data and analytics leaders believe their teams are effective in providing value to their organization, mainly due to insufficient resources, funding, and skilled staffers.

Armon Petrossian and Satish Jayanthi, former sales manager and senior solutions architect at WhereScape, respectively, faced these challenges while working on data warehousing problems for their clients. After six years at WhereScape, they decided to start Coalesce, a San Francisco-based company that provides a suite of data transformation services, apps, and tools.

Coalesce's mission is to radically improve the analytics landscape by making enterprise-scale data transformations as efficient and flexible as possible, allowing organizations to quickly move to implementing and taking advantage of AI and large language models. The company has recently closed a $50 million Series B funding round co-led by Industry Ventures and Emergency Capital, bringing their total raised to $81 million.

The Data Transformation Layer: A Bottleneck in Analytics

Data transformation and optimization are critical for organizations to gain valuable insights from their data. However, data science and engineering teams spend the majority of their time on data prep, which includes data cleansing and transformations, manually coding and building out data pipelines, and getting the data from source to dashboard or other business uses. These manual processes are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and don't scale.

To address this challenge, Coalesce has built a platform that standardizes data while automating the more repetitive, mundane data transformation processes. Using Coalesce, data science teams can employ metadata to manage transformations with an understanding of how the different pieces of data are linked and connected. This reduces the time and effort required in data transformation and optimization, ultimately resulting in faster time-to-value for the organization's data.

Coalesce's platform is built to work exclusively with Snowflake's Data Cloud product, and Snowflake's corporate VC arm, Snowflake Ventures, is an investor. However, Petrossian believes that Coalesce's focus on enterprise Fortune 500 companies makes it more resilient to economic shifts and market headwinds.

Competition in the Data Transformation Tool Market

Coalesce isn't the only data transformation tool vendor in the market. Other vendors, such as Dbt and legacy extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools like Informatica and Talend, could be considered rivals. However, Petrossian believes that Coalesce's focus on enterprise Fortune 500 companies and its ability to offer a scalable and efficient platform set it apart from the competition.

Coalesce's Roadmap

Coalesce plans to focus on improving the Coalesce platform's performance, introducing AI features, and reaching out to existing Snowflake customers. The company aims to expand its 80-person team to around 100 by the end of the year. Petrossian hinted that generative AI and machine learning applications could be force multipliers for Coalesce's business.

Conclusion

In conclusion, data transformation and optimization are essential tasks for organizations to gain valuable insights from their data. However, these challenges increase with the growth of AI and cloud technologies. Coalesce's platform, which standardizes data while automating the more repetitive, mundane data transformation processes, offers a solution to this challenge.

Sachin Bansal, the co-founder of e-commerce giant Flipkart, is reportedly in discussions with investors to secure funding for his fintech startup, Navi, at a valuation of around $2 billion. According to sources who spoke to TechCrunch, Bansal aims to raise between $200 million and $400 million in this funding round, which would be Navi's first significant outside fundraising since its inception in 2018.

Navi, which offers personal loans, home loans, and health insurance, initially aimed to raise $440 million through an initial public offering (IPO). However, due to the sluggish IPO market, the startup abandoned these plans in 2022. Bansal has primarily self-funded Navi up to this point.

Although discussions are ongoing, no deal has been finalized. The terms and Bansal's interest in outside funding may change during the negotiations. A Navi spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

This development in the venture market indicates a significant shift in India and signals a potential revival of growth-stage funding rounds for fintech businesses worldwide. The funding discussions follow a challenging 2023 in India's startup ecosystem, which experienced a 73% decline in overall funding.

Several other Indian startups, including Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund ADIA-backed audio-storytelling platform Pocket FM, Indian eyewear brand Lenskart, Temasek-backed consumer nutrition platform HealthKart, and bike-taxi aggregator Rapido, are also in talks to raise new growth-stage rounds.

Bansal's approach to Navi is a departure from his time at Flipkart, where he raised billions of dollars from a prestigious list of strategic and financial investors. After leaving Flipkart in 2018 with a $1 billion windfall, Bansal opted for a self-funded approach for Navi. Before the IPO filing, he engaged in discussions with potential investors, including SoftBank, but these talks stalled when Navi's application for a banking license was rejected","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-634332718.jpg?resize=1200,781",2024-04-04 06:31:36,"""Explore Sachin Bansal's $2B Navi fintech venture!

Introduction

Quantum computing holds the promise of revolutionizing the world with its potential to solve complex calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. Although we've seen incremental advancements in quantum hardware from industry leaders like IBM and Google, these machines have yet to be used for practical purposes. That is, until now. Microsoft and Quantinuum recently announced the development of the most error-free quantum computing system to date. Let's dive into the details of this groundbreaking achievement and what it means for the future of quantum computing.

The Quantum Computing Landscape

Classical computers and electronics rely on binary bits, which can be either on or off, as their basic unit of information. Quantum computers, on the other hand, work with qubits, which can exist in a superposition of two states simultaneously. The challenge with qubits is that they are prone to errors, which is the primary reason today's quantum computers, known as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, are only used for research and experimentation.

Microsoft's Solution

Microsoft's approach to overcoming qubit errors involved grouping physical qubits into virtual qubits, enabling error diagnostics and correction without destroying them, and implementing it all over Quantinuum's hardware. This resulted in an error rate that was 800 times better than relying on physical qubits alone. Microsoft claims to have run over 14,000 experiments with zero errors.

The Potential Impact

Microsoft's achievement could pave the way towards Level 2 Resilient quantum computing, which would be reliable enough for practical applications. The implications of this development are immense, as it would unlock the potential to solve previously intractable problems.

Expert Opinions

Aram Harrow, a professor of physics at MIT, specializing in quantum information and computing, shared his thoughts on Microsoft's announcement, stating that it is a ""strong result"" and that the ""Quantinuum system has impressive error rates and control, so it was plausible that they could do an experiment like this. It's encouraging to see that it worked.""

Paris-based startup Pigment has raised a massive $145 million in a Series D funding round, just five years after its inception. The enterprise software company offers a business planning platform for large companies to visualize their past financial performance and forecast upcoming quarters.

This funding round comes as a pleasant surprise, given the recent downturn in funding rounds in the French tech ecosystem, according to a recent study by EY. In 2023, funding rounds in the French tech ecosystem were down 38% compared to 2022. However, if we exclude buzzy AI startups like Mistral AI and capital-intensive infrastructure plays that are not really tech startups, like EV charging networks (Driveco) and EV battery factories (Verkor), funding rounds are drastically down.

Pigment appears as an exception with its Series D, led by existing investor Iconiq Growth, who is doubling down on this new funding round. Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners, IVP, Meritech, Greenoaks, and Felix Capital are also participating in the round, with many of them being existing investors as well.

The reason behind Pigment's successful raise is its remarkable growth. In the past year, the startup tripled its revenue and doubled its customer base, with well-known clients like Unilever, Datadog, Kayak, and Merck. Half of Pigment's clients are based in the U.S.

Pigment's co-founder and co-CEO, Eléonore Crespo, shared with me that their current investors told them, ""if you're going to raise money in 18 months to scale with others, we might as well offer you great terms right now for an internal round."" Everything happened quickly, with the funding round being completed in one week.

Before founding Pigment, Crespo worked for VC firm Index Ventures and Google. She co-founded Pigment with Romain Niccoli, who was the co-founder and CTO of adtech startup Criteo - an early success of the French tech ecosystem.

Pigment is a flexible business planning tool that is used by chief financial officers and finance teams to create reports and budgets. It's a modern SaaS platform, meaning that you can integrate it with all your company's data (ERP, HRIS, data lakes, etc.) and use it as a collaboration tool.

In addition to finance teams, sales teams can use Pigment to create quotas and see how everyone is performing against quarterly quotas. HR teams can see how they should scale the workforce up and down based on strategic changes and financial objectives.

As more teams start using Pigment, it becomes an important tool for cross-team collaboration. And it's supposed to work better than legacy tools from Oracle and SAP.

Like many software companies, Pigment has also added AI features. As Pigment acts as the central repository for all the important metrics of a company, customers can ask questions to Pigment AI in natural language to get a quick answer. Examples include ""Can you give me a breakdown of revenue per country?"" or ""Why was our actual revenue lower than our forecast last quarter for this product?""

However, what sets Pigment apart is its optimization of its core product to work well even with large datasets and complicated calculations. The best enterprise software products are must-have products, which means that companies usually don't need to spend a lot of resources on improving the product - clients need this tool to operate. Pigment is still the challenger in this industry, so it believes it needs to provide a better product to compete with other business planning products.

In conclusion, Pigment's successful Series D funding round is a testament to its exceptional growth and unique value proposition. As the company continues to innovate and provide a better product, it's poised to become a leader in the enterprise software space.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pigment-Eleonore-Crespo-and-Romain-Niccoli-cropped.jpg?resize=1200,674",2024-04-04 09:25:26,"Triple your revenue and double your customer base in under a year, and now Pigment is raising $145 million in Series D funding.

These events can cause widespread power outages that disrupt activities in the area. Climate change and global warming are expected to increase the risk of these events occurring, which could have significant consequences.

Recently, researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany conducted a study to investigate the impact of extreme weather events on the Texas power grid. Their paper, published in Nature Energy, could guide efforts by local governments and engineers in the area aimed at increasing the resilience of the electricity grid in the state of Texas.

The study's primary objective was to understand the interplay between evolving storm conditions and the partially destroyed state of the grid. This required the researchers to study the temporal-spatial structure of damages and outages, a topic with little preexisting research.

The researchers' approach differed from previous efforts in this field in that they did not only fail lines that were most likely to trigger outages in the unperturbed fully functional systems but also examined their impact in instances where a power grid had already suffered extensive damages. This allowed them to better determine the ""backbone"" of the grid, which supports its resilience.

According to Anvari, the paper is an interdisciplinary collaboration between impact modeling and infrastructure research carried out at PIK. ""Recent studies and statistics have shown a significant increase in power outages caused by extreme weather events. Our study focuses on extreme wind events, which have a significant impact on transmission lines and towers. Damage caused by extremely windy weather events to transmission lines often leads to further system and infrastructure failures, resulting in widespread blackouts and power outages.""

The researchers' approach involves using a key intuition rooted in complex systems research. This intuition is that if a complex but robust system fails due to external stresses, it typically does so following fairly well-defined patterns or failure modes. If these failure modes can be identified, it may be possible to prevent catastrophic failures.

In this study, the researchers identified critical lines that are most likely to trigger large-scale blackouts during extreme wind events. They recommend enhancing the resilience of these lines by replacing overhead lines with underground cables to ensure 100% safety against wind damage.

The study's findings could help guide efforts by local governments and engineers in the area aimed at increasing the resilience of the electricity grid in the state of Texas. By understanding the interplay between evolving storm conditions and the partially destroyed state of the grid, the researchers were able to identify the critical lines that support the grid's resilience and develop strategies to enhance their resilience against extreme wind events.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/exploring-the-resilien.jpg,2024-04-04 06:50:01,Understand how extreme wind events impact the Texas power grid.

Apple explores personal home robots; mobile assistant, tabletop with moving display. Early development under AI chief Giannandrea. ","

In recent years, Apple has undergone several significant shifts in its product roadmap. The company has decided to end its electric car project and focus on developing its presence in the AI space. Apple's next potential pivot may be into home robotics.

On Wednesday, Apple analyst Mark Gurman reported that the company is exploring the development of personal robots. The possible products include a mobile robot assistant that follows users around their homes and an advanced tabletop device with a moving display powered by robotics.

This development is reportedly happening under John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, who previously led machine intelligence, research, and search teams at Google. Matt Costello and Brian Lynch, two Apple executives in the hardware group, have overseen the hardware development of the robots, according to the report.

However, since the developments are in their early stages, and the company has not yet committed to the projects, there is no guarantee that the products will be released.

This isn't the first time Apple has considered creating a tabletop device with a display. In February, 9to5Mac reported that the company was working on an unreleased device that resembled a HomePod with a screen.

Even though this would be Apple's first time creating a home robot, it wouldn't be the first home robot to hit the market. Amazon has its robot assistant Astro, which it launched in 2021, and Samsung has its home assistant Ballie, a bowling ball-sized robot that can double as a projector, smart home hub, and more, and is expected to hit the market in 2024.

Today's report comes after Apple researchers published a research paper introducing the company's Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM), a model that could potentially improve Siri's conversational abilities.

Whether Apple's home robots hit the market or not, one thing is for sure -- the company is gearing up to become a major player in the AI and robotics space. We may get a glimpse of this latest AI push at WWDC in June.

Introduction

Imagine a world where the immense power of ocean waves is not only a source of fascination for surfers but also a significant contributor to our global energy needs. This vision is one step closer to reality, thanks to recent advancements in a device designed to harness ""blue energy."" Researchers have discovered that simply repositioning an electrode in a wave-energy harvesting device can dramatically increase the amount of energy captured from the ocean's ebb and flow.

The Blue Energy Harvesting Device: Liquid–Solid Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG)

The tube-shaped wave-energy harvesting device improved upon by the researchers is called a liquid–solid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). TENGs convert mechanical energy into electricity as water sloshes back and forth against the inside of the tube. One reason these devices aren't yet practical for large-scale applications is their low energy output.

Optimizing Energy Harvesting Ability

Guozhang Dai, Kai Yin, Junliang Yan and colleagues aimed to increase a liquid–solid TENG's energy harvesting ability by optimizing the location of the energy-collecting electrode. By placing the electrode at the end of the tube, where water crashes with the most force, the researchers found that the optimized design increased the device's conversion of mechanical energy to electrical current by 2.4 times.

A Closer Look at the Experiment

The researchers used 16-inch clear plastic tubes to create two TENGs. Inside the first device, they placed a copper foil electrode at the center of the tube—the usual location in conventional liquid–solid TENGs. For the new design, they inserted a copper foil electrode at one end of the tube. The researchers then filled the tubes a quarter of the way with water and sealed the ends. A wire connected the electrodes to an external circuit.

Placing both devices on a benchtop, the rocker moved water back and forth within the tubes and generated electrical currents by converting mechanical energy—the friction from water hitting or sliding against the electrodes—into electricity.
