Introduction

In a world where online censorship and suppression of certain content are becoming increasingly common, Truth Social, the social media platform owned by Donald Trump's media company, is making waves. The platform recently announced plans to launch a live TV streaming service focusing on news networks, religious channels, and family-friendly content. This move aims to provide a permanent home for high-quality news and entertainment that may face discrimination on other channels and content delivery services.

The Three Phases of Rollout

The new streaming platform will be rolled out in three phases. First, Truth Social will introduce its CDN (content delivery network) for streaming to the Truth Social app for Android, iOS, and the web. This will be followed by the release of over-the-top (""OTT"") streaming apps for various devices, including phones, tablets, and other gadgets. The final phase will involve launching a streaming app for TVs. According to Truth Social's CEO, Devin Nunes, the company has completed the research and development phase and is eager to move forward with the next significant phase for Truth Social.

Addressing the Elephant in the Room: Elon Musk's X

Elon Musk's X has been attempting to transform the social media site into a free-speech ""video-first"" platform. While it currently features shows hosted by Tulsi Gabbard and Jim Rome, it recently canceled a talkshow deal with former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The contrasting approaches of Truth Social and X highlight the growing demand for censorship-free platforms and the competition to cater to this audience.

The Financial Landscape

Truth Social went public last month after shareholders approved a merger of TMTG and Digital World Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). However, the company's stock has slumped this week after it announced plans to sell more shares to raise cash. Despite being valued at billions of dollars, TMTG has faced challenges in generating revenue, reporting a net loss of around $49 million in 2023 and making just under $4 million in revenue.

Popularity and User Engagement

Open source projects face growing risks from social engineering attacks, as seen in recent cases like XZ Utils & OpenJS targets. Alarmingly, more projects could be at risk. Recognize suspicious patterns & safeguard using expert advice & best practices.","Title: The Growing Concern of Social Engineering Attacks in Open Source Projects

Open source projects have become an integral part of the modern software development landscape. However, with this growing popularity, these projects have also become a target for malicious actors. Recently, the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and the OpenJS Foundation released a joint statement warning of potential coordinated takeover attempts in the open-source community. This announcement comes after the discovery of a backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) in the XZ Utils data compression utility, where a maintainer, Jia Tan, inserted a backdoor to allow attackers to compromise Linux systems.

The XZ Utils backdoor incident is not an isolated case, as the OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council has received a series of suspicious emails. These emails urged OpenJS to update one of its popular JavaScript projects, requesting to be designated as the new maintainer without providing specifics about critical vulnerabilities. The foundations discovered that at least two other projects were targeted with similar patterns.

In response to these incidents, the OpenJS Foundation and the Linux Foundation issued a joint statement to raise awareness about these ongoing threats and provide practical guidance from security and open-source experts. They identified the following suspicious patterns in social engineering takeovers:

1. Friendly yet aggressive pursuit of a maintainer
2. Request to be elevated to maintainer status
3. An endorsement from other unknown parties
4. Pull Requests containing blobs as artifacts
5. Intentionally obfuscated or difficult-to-comprehend source code
6. Gradual escalation of security issues
7. Deviation from typical project compile, build, and deployment practices
8. A false sense of urgency

If you or your project encounters any of these patterns, it's essential to take action. The OpenSSF Guides and CISA's ""Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks"" blog post are valuable resources to help protect your project from such threats.

Open source projects thrive on collaboration and trust, making them particularly vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Maintainers must be vigilant and adopt best practices to secure their projects, such as:

1. Verifying the identity of new contributors and maintainers
2. Using multi-factor authentication for project accounts
3. Regularly review",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/68246f99a27f94c68351677fb531449189906c30/2024/04/16/17d2c00f-be57-457c-adfd-89b9caad850a/backdoor-breaking-in-security-crowbar.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"Meta Description: Protect your open-source project!

In the digital age, the line between human and artificial interaction has become increasingly blurred. A groundbreaking study by the EPFL has revealed the persuasive prowess of large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's GPT-4, demonstrating that individuals engaging in debates with these models are significantly more likely to alter their viewpoints compared to those debating humans. This article will delve into the details of the study, the potential consequences, and the ethical implications of this newfound AI capability.

The study, ""On the Conversational Persuasiveness of large language models: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"" was conducted with 820 participants. Each individual was randomly assigned a topic and one of four treatment conditions: debating a human with or without personal information about the participant, or debating an AI chatbot (GPT-4) with or without personal information.

The results were striking. Participants who debated GPT-4 with access to their personal information had 81.7% higher odds of increasing their agreement with the debate proposition compared to those who debated humans. Even without personalization, GPT-4 still outperformed humans, albeit with a reduced effect. These findings suggest that not only are LLMs able to effectively exploit personal information to tailor their arguments and out-persuade humans in online conversations, but they do so with remarkable efficiency.

When humans were given the same personal information as the AI, they failed to utilize it effectively for persuasion. This discrepancy highlights the consistent superiority of AI models over human performance in persuasive debates.

Associate Professor Robert West, head of the Data Science Lab in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, commented on the implications of these findings, stating, ""In the context of the upcoming U.S. elections, people are concerned because that's where this kind of technology is always first battle-tested... One thing we know for sure is that people will be using the power of large language models to try to swing the election.""

Indeed, the potential for LLMs to manipulate public opinion is vast. With access to personal information, AI can micro-target individuals, crafting tailored arguments designed to exploit their biases and vulnerabilities.

A recent study from EPFL reveals that large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, possess unprecedented persuasive abilities during debates, causing individuals to modify their opinions more frequently when facing off against AI compared to human counterparts. Delving deeper into this investigation, this article explores the research, repercussions, and moral quandaries surrounding AI’s growing capacity to sway minds through customized discourse.

EPFL’s “On the Conversational Persuasiveness of Large Language Models” enlisted 820 participants divided amongst four categories—debating either a human or AI chatbot (GPT-4), with or without disclosed personal data. Results demonstrated that participants confronting GPT-4 while sharing personal info showed a staggering 81.7% increased likelihood of heightening alignment with the debate subject matter compared to encounters involving fellow humans. Surprisingly, even devoid of personalized intel, GPT-4 remained victorious in comparison to human opponents, although less dramatically. Evidently, sophisticated AI excel at harnessing private insights to maximize argument effectiveness and prevail in virtual dialogues.

Interestingly, when granted identical user data, human interlocutors struggled to leverage the material convincingly; further emphasizing AI’s persistent advantage in persuasive disputation.

Dr. Robert West, Director of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne’s Data Science Lab, addressed concerns regarding these revelations, particularly concerning imminent US elections. He cautioned, “One thing we know for certain is that people will use large language models to attempt influencing the outcome.” Indeed, AI’s ability to capitalize on intimate knowledge may result in highly targeted campaigns aimed at specific demographics, potentially skewing political outcomes.

As AI systems acquire greater proficiency in understanding and reacting to nuanced emotional cues, the challenge presented by hyper-personalized messaging becomes evermore apparent.

Betaworks is venturing into the AI realm, but not with just another large language model (LLM). Instead, they are focusing on a group of agent-like models designed to automate everyday tasks that are often complex and hard to define. The company's latest ""Camp"" incubator has trained and funded nine AI agent startups, with the hope that these services will take over tedious tasks.

The potential uses for these companies are promising, but AI has a history of falling short on its promises. Can you trust an AI to sort your email or extract and structure information from a webpage? Would anyone mind an AI scheduling meetings? These are questions that remain to be answered, as the technology is still in its early stages and trust has yet to be established.

Betaworks CEO and founder, John Borthwick, believes that the technology is ready for prime time. ""While agentic AI is in its infancy, and there are issues surrounding success rates, we're seeing significant progress,"" he said. Borthwick also believes that some customers are ready to embrace the technology, even in its current state.

The Betaworks Camp is a three-month accelerator program that provides selected companies with hands-on help with their product, strategy, and connections.

In the vast digital landscape, online toxicity has become an unfortunate norm. Negative comments, unproductive arguments, and even outright abusive behavior plague various platforms, from social media to news websites. Google's subsidiary, Jigsaw, has taken up the challenge to combat this issue with their Perspective API. This innovative tool harnesses artificial intelligence to detect harmful comments, fostering positive and engaging conversations.

What is the Perspective API?

Perspective API is a powerful Google tool that can be integrated into existing platforms, such as websites, apps, and comment systems. Its primary function is to analyze user-generated content and assess it based on several attributes, including toxicity, obscenity, and even the potential for sexual explicitness. By doing so, the API assigns scores to each attribute, enabling developers and moderators to filter out inappropriate content and promote healthier discussions.

The Evolution of Perspective API: Experimental Bridging Attributes

Jigsaw has recently expanded Perspective API's capabilities by introducing experimental bridging attributes. These enhanced features evaluate user comments across a broader spectrum of criteria, including:

1. Nuance: Determines if a comment is thought-provoking or presents a well-rounded perspective.
2. Curiosity: Identifies if the user shows genuine interest in understanding different viewpoints.
3. Personal storytelling: Recognizes whether the user shares a personal experience to provide context or empathize with others.
4. Reasoning: Assesses if the user attempts to logically understand or explain a concept.
5. Deference and appreciation: Identifies if the user acknowledges and respects others' opinions or expresses gratitude.

These new attributes aim to foster a more positive and engaging online environment by encouraging users to think critically, share personal experiences, and appreciate others' viewpoints.

How Does Perspective API Work?

When Perspective API evaluates a user comment, it assigns a score to each attribute. For example, a comment like ""You are an idiot"" would receive a toxicity score of 0.8, indicating that 8 out of 10 people might perceive it as toxic. This scoring system empowers moderators and developers to filter or prioritize",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/f66ea6a4095e9db8780165564cd126f71a002168/2024/04/16/8d28ca32-ae43-4a21-8117-bf6c7a8527a3/puzzle-pieces-circle-jigsaw.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"""Google's Perspective API: Detect toxicity, foster positive conversations with AI.

Introduction

A recent claim of an iMessage ""zero-day"" exploit has surfaced, causing a stir among iPhone users. Trust Wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, warned users to disable iMessage altogether due to a supposed high-risk vulnerability that could infiltrate iPhones without any interaction from the user. However, further investigation reveals that the situation may be far from the truth, with all signs pointing to an exaggerated threat, if not an outright scam.

The Origin of the Claim

Trust Wallet's initial tweet about the alleged exploit was based on intelligence from a dark web site named CodeBreach Lab. The site advertised the exploit for sale, asking for $2 million in bitcoin cryptocurrency. The advertisement claimed the exploit was a remote code execution (RCE) with no-interaction or ""zero-click"" capabilities, which could potentially target the latest iOS version.

Questioning the Authenticity

Despite the sensational claim, there is no evidence to support the existence of this exploit. RCEs are powerful tools for hackers, but they are extremely rare and difficult to develop. Moreover, the manner in which the exploit is being advertised and sold on the dark web raises suspicions about its authenticity.

The Likelihood of a Scam

Considering the circumstances and the newness of CodeBreach Lab, it is highly probable that the alleged exploit is a scam. The supposed company has no track record, and the website contains typos and offers no further evidence of its exploits. Trust Wallet may have fallen for this scam, spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the cybersecurity industry.

Mitigating Real Threats

While zero-day exploits do exist, they are not common. In reality, most users don't need to disable iMessage entirely. Instead, enabling Lockdown Mode, a special mode that disables certain features and functionalities of Apple devices, can help protect users from potential attacks. Apple has stated that there is no evidence of any successful hacks on devices using Lockdown Mode, and cybersecurity experts recommend using this feature as a more reliable precaution.

LG's CineBeam Q projector is a game-changer in the world of portable projectors. Weighing just three pounds, this device offers 4K resolution, vibrant colors, and a wide range of image sizes, from 50 to 120 inches. Its auto keystone screen adjustment and compact design make it an ideal choice for those seeking a versatile, cinematic experience. However, it does come with a few drawbacks, such as the need for an external speaker and a high price point.

The CineBeam Q's laser RGB light source creates a stunning image with vivid colors and high contrast, making it an excellent choice for movie nights or gaming. The auto keystone screen adjustment ensures a correctly proportioned image, regardless of the projector's position. This feature, combined with the adjustable rotating kickstand, makes it easy to set up and use in various environments.

One of the key advantages of the CineBeam Q is its portability. The device is lightweight and compact, allowing users to take it on the go for presentations, outdoor movie nights, or gaming events. It can project a 120-inch image from a distance of around 12 feet, or a 50-inch image from about five feet away. However, the image quality may suffer if the device is placed too close or far from the projection surface.

Navigating the CineBeam Q's interface is user-friendly, thanks to LG's webOS 6. The projector offers various streaming platform options, such as Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube, as well as the ability to connect to mobile devices using AirPlay. For physical connections, the Q features one HDMI port, one USB-C port, and a power port, allowing users to connect gaming consoles or soundbars.

Despite its many strengths, the CineBeam Q does have some limitations. The built-in three-watt speakers are relatively weak, so an external speaker or soundbar is recommended for a more immersive experience. Moreover, the device can be more expensive than some competitors in the portable projector market.

When using the CineBeam Q, it is essential to consider the lighting conditions.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/tesla-ditches-ev-inventory-discounts-to-streamline-sales-and-delivery/,Tesla ditches EV inventory price discounts as Elon Musk moves to 'streamline' sales and delivery," Tesla Streamlines Sales, Ends Discounts; Cuts Jobs & Executive Changes ","Title: Tesla's New Approach: Streamlining Sales, Delivery, and Pricing Strategy

Introduction

Tesla, known for its innovative electric vehicles and disruptive business strategies, has recently undergone significant shifts in its sales and pricing approach. After ending discounts on its entire U.S. lineup, laying off thousands of employees, and altering its executive team, questions arise regarding the future direction of the company. This article explores the recent developments and potential implications for Tesla consumers and investors alike.

Streamlining Operations and Discontinuing Discounts

CEO Elon Musk revealed plans to ""streamline"" Tesla's sales and delivery processes through his post on X, a social media platform owned by him. One apparent aspect of this change involves discontinuing incentives such as discounts previously offered on various EV models, like the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. Interestingly, Tesla had spent much of 2022 raising prices before switching gears and frequently reducing costs throughout 2023, sometimes by up to 20%. Recent reductions include a $5,000 decrease for select Model Y trims and over $7,000 less for rear-wheel-drive variants.

Moreover, Tesla lowered the monthly subscription fee for its Supervised Full Self-Driving software—its advanced driver assistance system—from $199 to $99. Despite these seemingly consumer-friendly adjustments earlier in the year, Tesla saw reduced profit margins due to aggressive price cutting. Furthermore, Q1 deliveries dipped YOY, while production volumes surpassed those delivered, indicating room for improvement in optimizing supply chain efficiency.

Addressing Challenges in Employment and Executive Changes

Recent employment cuts impacted approximately 14,000 individuals, equivalent to over 10% of Tesla's workforce. Affected departments included manufacturing, sales, and administrative positions. Alongside these dismissals, Rohan Patel, former Vice President of Public Policy and Business Development, departed amidst major organizational transformations. Additionally, Drew Baglino, Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy, followed suit around the same period. These personnel moves reflect broader realignments occurring inside the firm.

A spokesperson from Tesla confirmed the elimination of numerous job openings on its North American career portal, signaling a temporary hiring pause. Meanwhile, only a few remaining roles are associated with the Manufacturing Development Program. Some critics argue whether these measures adequately address underlying concerns affecting Tesla's operations.

Historical Context: Adjustments to Distribution Channels

Throughout its history, Tesla has garnered praise for its groundbreaking direct-sale model, effectively bypassing conventional dealership structures. However, challenges emerged during the customer journey beyond the initial point of sale. Notable instances include purchasing secondhand Teslas, servicing vehicles outside warranty periods, and encountering complications when attempting to resell batteries. To tackle distribution hurdles, Tesla acquired several trucking firms towards the end of 2018 to facilitate increased shipping volume for Model 3 sedans.

Subsequently, Tesla attempted further modifications to its sales strategy. Early 2019 brought news of store closures and mass layoffs intended to reduce operational expenses. Within weeks, however, the organization backtracked on these decisions. Most recently, Tesla acknowledged persistent difficulties managing end-of-quarter rushes to maximize car production and delivery quotas. Though acknowledging the issue since late 2022, solutions remain elusive thus far.

Conclusion

With the latest wave of changes encompassing employee reduction, leadership transitions, and strategic shifts in pricing policy, speculation abounds concerning the trajectory of Tesla moving forward. While the exact objectives behind these updates remain somewhat ambiguous, there is no doubt they represent critical inflection points for both the company and its stakeholders. By examining historical patterns and current industry trends, we can better understand the evolving landscape shaping Tesla's future success.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-1010166584.jpg?w=1024,2024-04-16 20:59:33,"Meta Description:
