Introduction

As India embarks on the world's most extensive democratic exercise—its nine-phase general election taking place between April 11 and May 19—the process faces an unprecedented challenge: the rapid spread of misinformation and 'cheapfakes.' These developments threaten not only free and fair elections but also the safety and security of millions of people in the diverse South Asian nation. This article examines the current state of online misinformation in India, focusing on cheapfakes, evasion of regulations, and the role of tech giants in addressing this pressing issue.

A New Era of Cheapfakes

With increasing internet penetration—from 14% in 2014 to approximately 50% today—and enhanced capabilities to manipulate multimedia content, the prevalence of cheapfakes has surged dramatically. According to Hamsini Hariharan, a subject matter expert at the U.K.-based fact-checking startup Logically, cheapfakes refer to content produced using relatively unsophisticated methods to distort images, videos, and audio files. Such materials often go viral on various social media platforms, influencing perceptions, swaying voters, and inciting tension among different demographics.

Recently, doctored videos featuring celebrities endorsing certain political parties and false information regarding the Model Code of Conduct applicable to both public events and private conversations have flooded social media. In response, eleven civil society organizations in India, including the Internet Freedom Foundation and SFLC.in, called upon the Election Commission to ensure accountability for political aspirants and social media entities involved in misusing such platforms.

Regulatory Challenges and Selective Enforcement

In 2022, the Indian government amended its IT Intermediary Rules, compelling social media firms to eliminate deceptive material from their sites within 72 hours of receiving reports. Despite these efforts, ambiguous guidelines and inconsistent enforcement persist. Critics point to instances of favoritism and uneven implementation, citing concerns raised by digital advocacy associations like the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Global technology leaders, Google and Meta, have pledged to minimize misleading content dissemination throughout the elections while restricting access to artificial intelligence chatbots responsible for responding to poll-related questions. Nevertheless, neither company has introduced substantial platform modifications or implemented decisive countermeasures against fabrications. Furthermore, prior to the balloting period, Meta allegedly reduced financial assistance provided to news agencies for undertaking fact-checking initiatives on WhatsApp.

Stakeholders' Responsibilities and Shortcomings

Alt News Co-Founder Pratik Sinha emphasizes that online misinformation cases in India have mushroomed due to insufficient cooperation from social media corporations. While these platforms host fact-checking projects, transparency concerning their efficacy remains elusive; none have released performance evaluations in recent years, raising doubts about their impact.

Angie Drobnic Holan, Director of the International Fact-Checking Network, concurs, highlighting numerous factors contributing to the intricate nature of misinformation eradication in India, including linguistic variety, cultural disparities, and legal vagueness surrounding defamatory content regulation. She stresses that collaborative solutions involving multiple stakeholders will likely yield better outcomes.

Conclusion

To safeguard the integrity of India's elections and protect its populace, tackling misinformation requires concerted efforts from all relevant parties, namely policymakers, regulatory authorities, tech enterprises, and civilians alike. By fostering open dialogues, investing in robust fact-checking mechanisms, implementing transparent reporting practices, and enhancing media literacy levels, India can effectively combat the scourge of misinformation threatening its vibrant democracy.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/india-election-2024-getty.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-20 12:00:27,"""Uncover the truth behind India's elections: Fight misinformation, expose cheapfakes.
