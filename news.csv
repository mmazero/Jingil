Introduction

The phase-out of nuclear plants in several countries has raised concerns about the viability of nuclear power. However, small modular reactor (SMR) manufacturers are optimistic that they can win over skeptical customers with the promise of carbon-free energy. Despite the recent cancellation of a next-generation US nuclear plant, there is renewed hope that new SMR projects will become operational by the end of the decade. This article explores the potential of SMRs and the challenges they face in a rapidly changing energy landscape.

The State of SMRs: Hopes and Challenges

Late last year, NuScale, a US energy company, abandoned its SMR project in Idaho due to escalating costs. The project, which was the only SMR design approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, saw its estimated price skyrocket from $5.3 billion to $9.3 billion. Skeptics argue that this failure should signal the end of SMRs, but proponents remain hopeful.

Mason Lester, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, points to positive developments in the US nuclear sector. For instance, GE Hitachi aims to begin power production with its new SMR design, the BWRX-300, in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, as early as 2029. Similarly, the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned US power company, has invested in the BWRX-300, indicating growing interest in SMRs.

Introduction

Have you ever wondered if subtle changes in how you interact with language models like ChatGPT could affect their responses' accuracy? A team of researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) decided to explore this question and investigate how various prompt variations could influence large language models' (LLMs) predictions. The results, posted on the preprint server arXiv, reveal that even minor alterations in prompts can significantly impact LLM performance.

The Four Categories of Prompt Variations

The researchers examined four categories of prompt variations:

1. Requesting responses in specific output formats, such as lists or CSVs.
2. Making minor perturbations to the prompt, like adding extra spaces at the beginning or end or incorporating phrases like ""Thank you"" or ""Howdy!""
3. Using ""jailbreaks"" to bypass content filters for sensitive topics.
4. Offering different amounts of tips to encourage improved responses.

Testing the Prompt Variations

The researchers tested these prompt variations across 11 benchmark text classification tasks to evaluate model performance. These tasks typically involve categorizing or assigning labels to text data based on their content or meaning. Some tasks included toxicity classification, grammar evaluation, humor and sarcasm detection, and mathematical proficiency.

Key Findings

The study's findings uncovered a significant relationship between prompt variations and LLM performance:

1. Specified output formats: By merely adding a specified output format, the researchers observed a minimum of 10% of predictions changed.
2. Minor perturbations: Adding spaces, common greetings, or ""Thank you"" caused more than 500 (out of 11,000) prediction changes.
3. Jailbreaks: Using jailbreaks resulted in a more significant proportion of changes but varied depending on the jailbreak used.
4. Tipping: Minimal performance changes were observed when offering tips or stating no tip would be given.

Implications

The researchers found that no single formatting or perturbation method suited all tasks. In fact, the ""No Specified Format"" achieved the highest overall accuracy, outperforming other variations by a full percentage point.

For specific applications requiring high accuracy, avoiding certain prompt formats (like",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/chatgpt-1.jpg,2024-04-08 13:20:02,"Learn How Prompt Variations Impact Large Language Models' Performance: Explore Four Key Categories & Key Findings - No Specified Format Achieves Highest Accuracy.

Biped climbing robots, like BiCR, promise innovation in industries requiring access to tall structures. Researchers at Guangdong University of Technology have developed BiCR-SLAM, a SLAM-based system that fuses data from joints, LiDAR, and cameras. This novel method enhances sensing, localization, and mapping capabilities for autonomous navigation in truss structures, paving the way for better installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude, high-risk environments.","Title: Advancing Biped Climbing Robots: A New SLAM-based Approach for Autonomous Navigation

Biped climbing robots have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from maintenance and installation on tall structures to parcel delivery in hard-to-reach locations. To achieve this, these robots must accurately sense and map their surroundings while maintaining precise location awareness. Researchers at Guangdong University of Technology have developed a novel method to enhance a biped climbing robot's ability to estimate its state and map its environment, specifically in truss structures.

A truss is a triangular system composed of interconnected straight elements, such as bridges, roofs, or other man-made structures. The researchers' proposed method, introduced in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, is based on a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, which has been adapted for a particular biped climbing robot, BiCR.

BiCR, developed by the Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab, is an electromechanical system with grippers at both ends and multiple joints. It can be used for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and high-risk environments, such as construction site scaffolding and power towers.

The primary objective of the study was to enable BiCR to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures. The team's SLAM-based approach fuses robot joint information and environmental information to improve localization accuracy.

BiCR-SLAM, the simultaneous localization and mapping system developed by the researchers, incorporates information about the BiCR robot's configuration, LiDAR sensing, and visual data collected by cameras to localize the robot and map the truss it is climbing. The framework can determine the pose of the robotic gripper and create a map of poles surrounding the gripper, allowing for better action planning during climbing.

BiCR-SLAM consists of four components: an encoder dead reckoning, a LiDAR odometry estimation tool, a pole landmark mapping model, and a global optimization technique. In the global optimization, a multi-source fusion factor graph is proposed to jointly optimize robot localization and pole landmarks.

The worlds of music and technology have always been intertwined, with each influencing the other's evolution. In recent years, the music industry has faced the challenge of adapting to the rapid advancements in technology, and now, it stands at the precipice of a new era: the generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) age. This article explores the opportunities and obstacles that GenAI presents to the music industry and how stakeholders can ensure that these two entities continue to coexist harmoniously.

One of the most pressing issues facing GenAI in music is the use of training data. Paul McCabe, Vice President of R&D at Roland, emphasized that companies must be responsible and equitable in their use of training data, even if it means compensating for its use. This is particularly challenging when competing with applications built on scraped online data, which often bypass ethical AI guidelines. While regulators will play a crucial role in enforcing compliance, galvanizing grassroots support and driving the need for updated copyright laws is equally important.

GenAI has the potential to revolutionize music creation and learning. Songwriters can transcend the limitations of their instrumental skills and familiarity with recording processes. Meanwhile, beginners can utilize natural language processing and conversational prompts to learn new instruments more easily. Music, whether human-created or AI-generated, will continue to evolve, with GenAI marking another inflection point in its trajectory.

Roland, a leading manufacturer of keyboards and drum machines, aims to create an AI-driven environment that ensures music creators are equitably recognized and compensated for their work. In partnership with Universal Music Group, they have released ""Principles for Music Creation with AI,"" outlining a responsible approach to AI use in music creation, production, composition, and songwriting.

These principles prioritize transparency and the protection of human-created works, requiring authorization and compensation for the use of copyrighted works, music artists' names, images, and voices. AI-powered platforms and policies should maintain trust by prioritizing record-keeping and disclosure across all stakeholders, including fans and artists.

The music industry has shown considerable interest in these principles, with over 60 global companies, including music labels, recording studios, and academia, expressing support.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/1fa1bcc65b79a019f29b443ab4c75b067b865dc2/2024/04/08/21d08330-eeb8-4fd0-8f0a-c269c14189eb/gettyimages-1469448038.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-08 00:00:00,"""Discover the future of music creation with AI!

Introduction

The global energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, with green hydrogen emerging as a promising clean energy carrier for the future. Among the various renewable energy sources available, solar energy holds a unique advantage due to its ubiquity and minimal dependence on natural topography. However, fluctuations in solar output and generation due to seasonal and weather variations can lead to repetitive increases and decreases in power, potentially damaging the components of production devices. To address this challenge, precise evaluation of the durability of devices under power fluctuations is crucial for determining the optimal timing for component replacement and developing new materials.

A Breakthrough in Durability Evaluation

Dr. Bora Seo's research team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has developed a groundbreaking durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices using actual solar irradiance data with step durations as short as one second. This innovation represents the application of the shortest step duration among developed techniques, enabling the most accurate simulation of fluctuations in actual solar energy output. The new technique has been published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science.

Existing durability evaluation methods have not accurately reflected solar output variability, relying solely on simple methods such as periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Moreover, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions.

The KIST team has developed a simulation method that converts irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data obtained from solar panels and water electrolysis stack data. This has dramatically shortened the step duration from 10 seconds to 1 second, allowing fluctuations in solar output to be accurately reflected.

Key Indicators for Material Development

Based on the newly developed durability evaluation technique, the team has proposed key indicators for the material development of green hydrogen production devices. Standardized analysis methods for assessing performance degradation of materials such as catalysts and electrolyte membranes, as well as indicators of performance degradation such as catalyst leaching amount, fluoride release rate, and thickness of passivation layer, have been proposed. These guidelines can be utilized for the development of materials and components to improve the durability and performance of green hydrogen production",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/development-of-durabil.jpg,2024-04-08 09:25:03,"Meta Description: Discover a groundbreaking durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices, using real solar irradiance data in 1-second steps.

Drones have become increasingly popular for various applications, from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions. However, battery life remains a significant limitation, with even commercial models only staying aloft for 45 minutes on a single charge. Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark have been working tirelessly to address this issue by developing drones that can recharge directly from power lines. This innovative technology promises to revolutionize how drones are used for power line inspections and other applications.

The researchers recently unveiled a Tarot 650 Sport drone, customized with an electric quadcopter propulsion system, an autopilot module, and other components. This drone is equipped with a gripper system, camera, and millimeter-wave radar system to locate and connect to the nearest power line when its battery runs low.

The drone navigates to the power line from beneath, using inward-sloping arms to guide the cable into the gripper. An inductive charger then draws current from the power line, charging the drone's battery. Once fully charged, the gripper releases the power line, and the drone resumes its flight path.

The primary objective of this technology is to facilitate power line inspections by drones, allowing them to remain in the air for extended periods. In 2022, the researchers demonstrated a self-charging drone capable of topping up its battery from power lines. In their latest breakthrough, the gripper system has been improved, and a real-world use case has been successfully demonstrated.

In a paper to be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, the team describes the project as ""a first-in-the-world system with the ability to sustain operation throughout many inspection/charging cycles powered by energy harvesting from power lines in a real outdoor environment."" The most successful test saw the drone remain airborne for over two hours, completing five cycles of power line inspection and charging.

The potential applications of this technology extend beyond power line inspections. By enabling drones to recharge from power lines, flight times can be significantly increased, opening up new possibilities for various industries, such as agriculture, construction, and emergency response.
