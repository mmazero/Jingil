https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080, Climate Crisis: MIT Tool Shows Outdoor Days Loss by 2080 ,"The climate crisis is a complex issue that can be difficult to understand and relate to. Researchers at MIT have developed a tool that provides a tangible way to see how many ""outdoor days"" a region might experience from now through 2100 if carbon emissions growth remains unchecked.
The results of this tool are both alarming and comforting, depending on where you live. For example, California and France can expect a little more clement weather in the spring and fall, while New York and Massachusetts will lose a week or more of outdoor days.
However, the countries with the most vulnerable populations, such as Nigeria and India, will suffer the most. Nigeria's summers will grow even hotter and longer, while India will lose almost two and a half months of outdoor days.
Despite the potential negative consequences, it's not too late to take action. Even if the world fails to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the situation will improve dramatically if carbon emissions growth is reduced by 2070.
Climate scenario analysis is a growing field that uses computational power to create more sophisticated climate models. This predictive capability is being used by a range of startups to help shape an uncertain future, from investors and lenders to insurers and agribusinesses.
Startups like Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern provide dashboards and data feeds to help customers understand the risk of flood, wildfire, and drought. ClimateAI focuses on agriculture, providing water risk assessments for agribusinesses, lenders, and food and beverage companies. Sensible Weather provides insurance for outdoor events and activities, giving customers the option to insure their outing against inclement weather.

In conclusion, the climate crisis is a serious issue that requires immediate action. The MIT tool provides a tangible way to understand the potential consequences of inaction, and startups like Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, One Concern, ClimateAI, and Sensible Weather are using predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future. As more businesses and consumers become aware of the impact of climate change, there will be new markets for these startups to expand into.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"Improve your understanding of the climate crisis with MIT's tool, which predicts outdoor days through 2100.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/instagram-is-developing-blend-recommended-reels-for-you-and-a-friend/,"Instagram is developing 'Blend,' recommended Reels for you and a friend"," Instagram Reels: Personalized ""Blend"" for friends ","Instagram has been working on a new feature called ""Blend,"" which generates a personalized feed of Reels based on a user's interests and the Reels they have shared with their friends. The feature is still in the internal prototype stage and not being tested externally, but it appears to be somewhat similar to Spotify's ""Blend"" feature, which allows two users to create a shared playlist of their favorite songs.

If a user decides to create a Blend with their friend, Instagram will generate a feed of Reels that it believes will be interesting to both of them. The feature is designed to provide users with a fun and collaborative way to discover new Reels together. By leveraging the data on users' interactions with Reels, Instagram can proactively recommend and display Reels that will appeal to each user.

The feature is intended to be private between the two users and can be left at any time. However, Instagram has not shared any details about whether Blends will continuously update with new recommendations or if they will be updated after a certain amount of time.

While Blend is still a prototype, it has the potential to give Instagram Reels users access to a unique and collaborative feature that is not available on its rival platform, TikTok. Although the two products are quite similar, the introduction of ""Blend"" could give Instagram a slight competitive edge over TikTok, albeit a small one.

If released, Blend could be a valuable addition to Instagram's Reels feature, providing users with a more personalized and engaging way to discover new content. It will be interesting to see if Instagram decides to launch the feature externally and how users respond to it.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 17:37:41,"""Discover new Reels together with Instagram's 'Blend' feature.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/openai-custom-voice-engine-preview/,"OpenAI built a voice cloning tool, but you can’t use it… yet", Voice Cloning Tool Built by OpenAI ,"Cleaning Instructions:

Original Text:

Today marks the preview debut of OpenAI’s Voice Engine, an expansion of the company’s existing text-to-speech API. Under development for about two years, Voice Engine allows users to upload any 15-second voice sample to generate a synthetic copy of that voice. But there’s no date for public availability yet, giving the company time to respond to how the model is used and abused.

“We want to make sure that everyone feels good about how it’s being deployed — that we understand the landscape of where this tech is dangerous and we have mitigations in place for that,” Jeff Harris, a member of the product staff at OpenAI, told TechCrunch in an interview.

Training the model

The generative AI model powering Voice Engine has been hiding in plain sight for some time, Harris said.

The same model underpins the voice and “read aloud” capabilities in ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, as well as the preset voices available in OpenAI’s text-to-speech API. And Spotify’s been using it since early September to dub podcasts for high-profile hosts like Lex Fridman in different languages.

I asked Harris where the model’s training data came from — a bit of a touchy subject. He would only say that the Voice Engine model was trained on a mix of licensed and publicly available data.

Models like the one powering Voice Engine are trained on an enormous number of examples — in this case, speech recordings — usually sourced from public sites and data sets around the web. Many generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info pertaining to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much.

OpenAI is already being sued over allegations the company violated IP law by training its AI on copyrighted content, including photos, artwork, code, articles and e-books, without providing the creators or owners credit or pay.

OpenAI has licensing agreements in place with some content providers, like Shutterstock and the news publisher Axel Springer, and allows webmasters to block its web crawler from scraping their site for training data. OpenAI also lets artists “opt out” of and remove their work from the data sets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, including its latest DALL-E 3.

But OpenAI offers no such opt-out scheme for its other products. And in a recent statement to the U.K.’s House of Lords, OpenAI suggested that it’s “impossible” to create useful AI models without copyrighted material, asserting that fair use — the legal doctrine that allows for the use of copyrighted works to make a secondary creation as long as it’s transformative — shields it where it concerns model training.

Synthesizing voice

Surprisingly, Voice Engine isn’t trained or fine-tuned on user data. That’s owing in part to the ephemeral way in which the model — a combination of a diffusion process and transformer — generates speech.

“We take a small audio sample and text and generate realistic speech that matches the original speaker,” said Harris. “The audio that’s used is dropped after the request is complete.”

As he explained it, the model is simultaneously analyzing the speech data it pulls from and the text data meant to be read aloud, generating a matching voice without having to build a custom model per speaker.

It’s not novel tech. A number of startups have delivered voice cloning products for years, from ElevenLabs to Replica Studios to Papercup to Deepdub to Respeecher. So have Big Tech incumbents such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft — the last of which is a major OpenAI’s investor incidentally.

Harris claimed that OpenAI’s approach delivers overall higher-quality speech.

We also know it will be priced aggressively. Although OpenAI removed Voice Engine’s pricing from the marketing materials it published today, in documents viewed by TechCrunch, Voice Engine is listed as costing $15 per one million characters, or ~162,500 words. That would fit Dickens’ “Oliver Twist” with a little room to spare. (An “HD” quality option costs twice that, but confusingly, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that there’s no difference between HD and non-HD voices. Make of that what you will.)

The team has published a paper describing the new AI system and how well it performed on the arXiv preprint server.

Large language models such as ChatGPT have been making headlines over the past few years for their ability to write papers, answer questions, and solve math problems. However, they suffer from one significant issue: accuracy. Every result obtained by an LLM must be manually verified to ensure that the results are correct, a tedious process that greatly reduces their value.

Recognizing this problem, the researchers at DeepMind have developed an AI application called Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE) that can automatically identify inaccuracies in LLM responses.

To test their system, the research team used it to verify approximately 16,000 facts contained in answers given by several LLMs. They compared their results against human (crowdsourced) fact-checkers and found that SAFE matched the findings of the humans 72% of the time. When testing disagreements between SAFE and the human checkers, the researchers found SAFE to be the one that was correct 76% of the time.

The team at DeepMind has made the code for SAFE available for anyone who chooses to take advantage of its capabilities by posting it on the open-source site GitHub.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-openai-unveils-voice-cloning-tool.html,OpenAI unveils voice-cloning tool," ""OpenAI's Voice Cloning Tool: Addressing Risks & Safe Use in Elections"" ","In the age of artificial intelligence, voice cloning tools are becoming increasingly accessible and affordable, posing a significant threat to democratic processes and the integrity of information. OpenAI, a leading AI research organization, has recently introduced a voice-cloning tool called ""Voice Engine"" that can accurately replicate someone's speech based on just a 15-second audio sample. While the technology has the potential to be used for creative and educational purposes, OpenAI recognizes the serious risks involved and has taken a cautious approach to its release.

The tool's potential for misuse, particularly during election season, is a major concern for disinformation researchers and experts in the field. With the rise of deepfake technology, the ability to manipulate audio and video content has become exponentially easier, making it more difficult to differentiate between real and fake content. The widespread use of AI-powered deepfake disinformation in the 2024 White House race and other key elections around the world could have devastating consequences for democratic processes and the public's trust in information.

To address these concerns, OpenAI has implemented several safety measures, including watermarking to trace the origin of any audio generated by Voice Engine and proactive monitoring of how the tool is being used. Partners testing the tool have also agreed to strict rules, including requiring explicit and informed consent of any person whose voice is duplicated using the tool and making it clear to audiences when they are hearing AI-generated content.

While the cautious release of Voice Engine is a positive step towards addressing the potential risks associated with voice cloning technology, there is still much work to be done to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI-powered applications. It is crucial that policymakers, industry leaders, and individuals work together to develop and implement effective safeguards and regulations to protect the integrity of information and prevent the misuse of AI for nefarious purposes.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/openai-says-ways-to-ve.jpg,2024-03-30 06:23:09,Read this article to learn about the dangers of AI-powered deepfake and how to prevent its misuse during elections., AI-powered deepfake ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://venturebeat.com/security/can-generative-ai-help-address-the-cybersecurity-resource-gap/,Can generative AI help address the cybersecurity resource gap?, How Generative AI Can Help Bridge Cybersecurity Skills Gap ,"In today's cybersecurity landscape, there is a growing shortage of skilled professionals. The industry is facing a nearly 4 million person workforce shortage, and this number is only expected to grow. To address this challenge, generative AI can be a valuable tool to help bring more qualified people into the cybersecurity field and amplify the output of those already working in it.
Gen AI has several benefits for the security workforce. First, it can lower the bar to entry by creating more dynamic training that meets new hires where they are, rather than requiring them to have specialized training and certifications. This can help organizations find and secure talent more quickly.
Second, gen AI can improve the user-friendliness of documentation. Today, there are pages and pages of technical documentation for most cybersecurity tools, which can be overwhelming for users. Gen AI can process and distill this information into something more precise and meaningful for the user, making it easier for customers to access information and implement solutions.
Third, gen AI can reduce the risk of burnout for security professionals. Large language models (LLMs) are purpose-built to analyze and synthesize data, which can be applied to an organization's large amount of internal and external documentation. By reducing the time that security analysts need to find information, they can focus on more important tasks like remediating and reducing risk.
Another area where gen AI can be particularly useful is continual education. As cybersecurity threats, attack vectors, and bad actors are constantly evolving, security professionals need to stay up-to-date on the latest developments. Gen AI can be used to gather and distill information from trusted sources, such as favorite trade publications and industry associations, to provide security professionals with the knowledge they need to protect their organizations.
Finally, gen AI can improve cross-team organizational security communications. For example, if an organization sees persistent phishing attempts, gen AI can analyze the text and create custom messaging based on each department's function to best equip them to mitigate the risk. This can help reduce incident load and free up time for security professionals to focus on more important tasks.
To ensure the proper use of gen AI in the cybersecurity workforce, we must carefully consider how it should be used and put in place appropriate policies and safeguards. For example, we recommend that organizations choose a gen AI platform and put in place a paid, contractual relationship with the vendor to provide guidance on the tool and help troubleshoot any issues.
In conclusion, generative AI has the potential to bring more qualified people into the cybersecurity field and amplify the output of those already working in it. By taking the time to build the right guardrails, we can use gen AI to create a more efficient and effective security workforce.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-giant-unlocked-padlock-letting-out-a-burst-of-li-7KrtL86MSyS_AD7ADE46qw-s-BURFAZT7mJv6iRNfMBbg-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-30 19:15:00,"Improve cybersecurity workforce with AI - AI in cybersecurity can help find and secure talent, improve user-friendliness of documentation, reduce burnout, provide continual education, and improve cross-team organizational security communications.

Researchers are working on ways to improve an AI's ability to understand context and feedback through techniques like reinforcement learning and attention models.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an AI learns to make decisions based on feedback from the environment. This can be especially useful in complex situations where there is a lot of uncertainty and the AI needs to learn from its mistakes. Attention models, on the other hand, can help an AI focus on the most relevant information in a given input. These models have been used to improve performance in tasks like language translation and image classification.

While these techniques are still in their early stages of development, they hold promise for improving the performance and reliability of AI systems. As the field continues to advance, we can expect to see more sophisticated and accurate AI assistants like me that can better understand and respond to user needs.

In addition to these technical advancements, it's also important to consider ethical and social implications of AI. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's crucial that we ensure it is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. This includes addressing issues like bias, privacy, and accountability. It's also important to consider the potential impact of AI on jobs and the economy, and to develop policies and regulations that promote fairness and equity.

Overall, while AI still has many limitations and challenges, its potential to transform industries and improve our lives is significant. With continued research and development, as well as careful consideration of ethical and social implications, we can create a future where AI works for everyone.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sensetime1.jpg?resize=1200,640",2024-03-30 13:01:25,Improve AI's ability to understand context and feedback through techniques like reinforcement learning and attention models.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/x-confirms-plans-for-nsfw-communities/,X confirms plans for NSFW Communities, X Confirms Plans for NSFW Communities on Platform ,"X, the company formerly known as Twitter, has announced that Community admins can now label their communities as “Adult Content” to avoid having their NSFW content filtered automatically. This change follows earlier tests of NSFW communities and confirms that X will now more directly embrace adult content on the platform.

NSFW content plays a significant role on X, which has been a primary advertising venue for sex workers and home to a large amount of adult content-focused bots and spam. According to internal documents obtained by Reuters in 2022, roughly 13% of all Twitter posts included NSFW content. What’s more, the documents indicated that adult content was one of the fastest-growing genres on the platform, even as news and sports were declining.

Recent reports have detailed the rise of spam bots on X, which promoted NSFW content with links in their profiles, leading them to regularly reply to posts with messages like “nudes in bio,” “pics in bio,” and other more explicit terms.

Now, Community admins can add an “Adult Content” label to their communities to keep from having their content filtered automatically. The updates, posted on X by an engineer, were reshared by Musk, who commented, “Many upgrades to X Communities!”

Communities are something that owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino promoted during an all-hands last fall as being key to X’s growth plans. If X were able to make Communities a successful product, it could potentially serve as a competitor to larger forum sites like Reddit and host training data for Musk’s xAI-run chatbot Grok, which has exclusive access to X content.

Alongside the news that Community admins can now label themselves as including adult content, X will also introduce a Ban button alongside Keep and Hide buttons on the Reported posts page, along with more detailed messages explaining why you’re not eligible to join a given Community, plus temporary and permanent bans for spammers. There will also be tools to sort posts by Trending, Most recent, and Most liked, a Media tab for Communities on Android, and more, including a range of bug fixes and minor improvements.

The list of what’s ahead for Communities was extensive, noting that users will soon be able to explore top posts and top communities across all Communities, and tools to discover top communities and posts by topic. Communities will also be promoted and recommended to potentially interested users on the For You tab, allowing them to grow more of a following. Mods will have access to Community Analytics and will be able to pin multiple members’ posts. There will also be support for spam filter levels set by admins, simplified reporting and moderation pages, and audio Spaces in Communities.

In conclusion, X’s latest updates to Communities include the confirmation that NSFW-focused communities will be allowed to designate themselves as such, which will keep their content from being filtered automatically. The changes, posted on X by an engineer, were reshared by Musk, who commented, “Many upgrades to X Communities!” With the addition of the Ban button, more detailed messages explaining why you’re not eligible to join a given Community, plus temporary and permanent bans for spammers, users will have more options to manage their communities and their content.

Are you ready to experience the future of mobile vision? The development of 6G mobile vision services is bringing innovative technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and autonomous driving to your fingertips. With these services, you can capture videos and images in an instant and efficiently understand their content through deep learning-based models.

However, this requires high-performance processors (GPUs) and accurate learning models. The problem is that previous technologies treated learning models and computing/networking resources as separate entities, failing to optimize performance and mobile device resource utilization.

This is where Professor Jeongho Kwak from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST comes into play. His team has developed a learning model and resource optimization technology that combines accuracy and efficiency for 6G vision services. This technology is expected to be utilized to address the high levels of computing power and complex learning models required by 6G vision services.

The VisionScaling algorithm developed by Professor Kwak's team adapts to constantly changing mobile environments to maintain optimal performance, even without prior knowledge of future conditions, through the use of 'Online Convex Optimization (OCO),' one of the latest learning techniques. This algorithm reduces energy consumption by at least 30% while maintaining average accuracy compared to current technologies without compromising on average target accuracy or time delay.

Furthermore, Professor Kwak's team implemented and tested the real-world mobile vision service environment using embedded AI devices and connected edge computing platforms. They confirmed that the developed VisionScaling algorithm saves 30% more energy in mobile devices and improves end-to-end latency by 39% compared to previously used algorithms.

Professor Jeongho Kwak from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST stated, ""This research satisfies both the practical contribution of implementing and verifying performance in irregularly changing mobile environments and the mathematical contribution of utilizing dynamic optimization and learning techniques to prove optimal performance. It is significant as it provides a technical foundation for deep learning-based mobile services requiring higher memory/computing resources in the future.""

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/the-ai-world-needs-more-data-transparency-and-web3-startup-space-and-time-says-it-can-help/,The AI world needs more data transparency and web3 startup Space and Time says it can help," ""Data Transparency & Verifiability in the AI World: How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Can Help"" ","In the ever-evolving AI landscape, data transparency and verification have become more critical than ever. With more data manipulation happening online, ensured trustworthiness of data and brands is an absolute necessity. Scott Dykstra, CTO and Co-founder of Space and Time, shares his insights on this topic during an interview on TechCrunch's Chain Reaction podcast.

According to Dykstra, the need for data transparency and verifiability can be traced back to the collapse of FTX, a crypto exchange where there was manipulation of financial records. This ensured that investors were misled, and this problem extends beyond the crypto industry into other sectors where financial institutions may manipulate their records for their own benefit.

To address these challenges, Dykstra suggests that the answer lies in the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs), cryptographic actions that can prove something about a piece of information without revealing the origin data itself. ZK proofs can be used to verify and retrieve data in situations where there is an incentive for bad actors to manipulate data, prices, books, finances, or more.

At a high level, ZK proofs work by having two parties, the prover and the verifier, that confirm a statement is true without conveying any information more than whether it's correct. For example, if a person wants to know whether someone's credit score is above 700, a ZK proof can confirm that to the verifier without disclosing the exact number.

Space and Time aims to be the verifiable computing layer for web3 by indexing data both off-chain and on-chain, but Dykstra sees it expanding beyond the industry and into others. The startup has already indexed from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, Sui, Avalanche, Sei, and Aptos and is adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

One of Dykstra's recent concerns is that AI data is not verifiable. According to him, while teams are working on building ZK proofs for machine learning or large language models, it can take years to create that, and the model operator can tamper with the system or LLM to do things that are problematic. This means that there needs to be a decentralized, globally available database that can be created through blockchains, which can be accessed by everyone and cannot be a monopoly.

In a hypothetical scenario, Dykstra suggests that OpenAI, the proprietor of a database of a journal for which journalists are creating content, cannot be the owner of the database. Instead, it has to be something that's owned by the community and operated by the community in a way that's readily available and uncensorable. This ensures that the community can verify the authenticity of the content and","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1828490321.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 17:00:55,Verify data transparency in AI and blockchain technology., Data transparency,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://www.engadget.com/how-uber-and-the-gig-economy-changed-the-way-we-live-and-work-164528738.html,How Uber and the gig economy changed the way we live and work,"""Uber and gig economy: the impact, controversies, and future of work""","The gig economy has taken over the world, and it's all thanks to the rise of smartphones. It wasn't long before the idea of the sharing economy caught on, and companies like Uber took advantage of the climate to become giants in the industry. Of course, Uber has been at the center of controversy and has faced many legal battles, but its impact on the taxi industry is undeniable.

The problem with Uber is that it turned a traditionally employee-based industry into one that is contractor-based. This means that many drivers are struggling to make ends meet, with traditional cab drivers seeing the value of their medallions plummet. In some cases, governments have tried to offset this collapse by providing compensation to cab drivers, but in other cases, taxpayers have had to bear the brunt of the impact.

However, the gig economy has not only hurt traditional cab drivers but also ride-sharing drivers. In 2017, Uber settled allegations from the Federal Trade Commission for using false promises about potential earnings to entice drivers to join its platform. Late last year, Uber and Lyft agreed to pay $328 million to New York drivers after the state conducted a wage theft investigation.

In addition to the legal battles, Uber has been fighting against ride-sharing drivers' efforts to be recognized as employees rather than contractors. This would give them consistent hourly wages, overtime pay, and benefits. In January, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that aims to make it more difficult for gig economy companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The EU is also weighing a provisional deal to reclassify millions of app workers as employees.

The goal of Uber was not just to reduce labor costs, but to eliminate them entirely by rolling out a fleet of self-driving vehicles and flying taxis. As former CEO Travis Kalanick said in 2014, ""When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. So the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away.""

But despite its efforts, the gig economy has not gone away, and it continues to grow. The sharing economy has become a major part of our daily lives, and it's up to us to ensure that it remains a force for good.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1_Kh9h_P4emCAe45VfYL_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/70ebe730-e083-11ee-adb4-2a4cdea0f515,2024-03-29 16:45:28,Drive with purpose: Uber's gig economy and its impact on society., Uber gig economy ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-elastic-strain.html,A first-ever complete map for elastic strain engineering," ""Tuning Materials for Specific Properties with Phonon Stability Boundary Map"" ","The phonon stability boundary is a vital tool for scientists and engineers to determine the conditions under which a material can exist in a particular phase and when it might fail or transition to another phase. This boundary, represented graphically, plots the stability regions of a crystal as a function of strain, providing a detailed map of material properties at extreme conditions. By analyzing this map, researchers can design new materials with desired characteristics.

In recent years, scientists have discovered that while bulk materials behave in certain ways, those rules can break down for materials at the micro- and nano-scales, and often in surprising ways. One such surprise was the finding that applying even modest strains on materials can dramatically improve certain properties, provided those strains stay elastic and do not relax away by plasticity, fracture, or phase transformations.

Micro- and nano-scale materials are especially good at holding applied strains in the elastic form, making them ideal for material engineering applications. However, precisely how to apply those elastic strains (or equivalently, residual stress) to achieve specific material properties has been less clear.

A team of MIT researchers has recently developed the first-ever map of how to tune crystalline materials to produce specific thermal and electronic properties. They used a combination of first principles calculations and machine learning to create this map, which delineates the complete six-dimensional boundary of ideal strength, the upper limit to elastic strain engineering, and creates a map for these electronic and phononic properties.

The researchers demonstrated that diamond, with just one element, is equivalent to a six-component alloy, because you have six degrees of elastic strain freedom you can tune independently. This means that diamond can be used to create a variety of new materials with specific thermal and electronic properties.

Small strains can also have significant material benefits. For example, researchers have shown that applying a small elastic strain to diamond can reduce its band gap, making it a better semiconductor material. By using this map, researchers can navigate the electronic and phononic properties of a material and identify the boundaries of its ideal strength and performance.

In conclusion, the phonon stability boundary is a powerful tool for material engineering applications. By analyzing this map, scientists and engineers can design new materials with specific thermal and electronic properties, taking advantage of the unique properties of micro- and nano-scale materials.

Google is shutting down its Podcasts app in the U.S. in the coming days. The company has started warning users to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music by April 2 to continue streaming their favorite shows. Users who don't act quickly will still have some time to move, but they won't be able to stream from the Podcasts app directly after this date.

The Google Podcasts app, which has been installed over 500 million times on Android devices globally over the past decade, offers a simple interface for discovering, following and listening to podcasts, as well as tools to add podcasts by RSS feed. Unfortunately, the tech giant announced last September that it would begin winding down the Podcasts app in early 2024 as part of its plan to centralize its audio services under YouTube.

YouTube Music, which was launched in 2015, was initially focused on music streaming. However, in 2020, it offered a transition strategy to move music listeners away from Google Play Music ahead of its shutdown. The Google Podcasts app continued to be maintained for years, but YouTube Music wasn't ready to support podcasts until recently. By the end of 2023, YouTube Music was able to support podcasts globally, and by February, it had the ability to upload RSS feeds.

The move to shift podcasting over to YouTube could help Google become a bigger player in the space by combining its efforts and sharpening its focus. Additionally, interest in video podcasts, which were already popular on YouTube, is on the rise. This week, Spotify forged a deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) to bring video podcasts to U.S. users of its streaming app after earlier in March announcing tests of video podcasts in 11 other markets around the world.

Bleeping Computer was the first to notice the shutdown date for Google Podcasts in the U.S., and a support page on Google's site confirms that users in the U.S. will only be able to use the Podcasts app through the end of March 2024. For those who miss the in-app pop-ups, Google will offer users additional time to save their subscriptions by allowing them to use the app's export feature through July 2024.

Google did not immediately return a request for comment, but after publication, it responded to say that while it was still ""tracking towards"" the April 2 timeline for the U.S., it has not shared a timeline for the rest of the world yet. From its earlier statements, though, the plan is to discontinue Google Podcasts globally in 2024.

The Google Podcasts app was a popular choice among podcast listeners, offering a simple and streamlined interface for discovering, following, and listening to podcasts, as well as tools to add podcasts by RSS feed. Unfortunately, the end of the app is imminent, and users will need to migrate to YouTube Music if they want to continue streaming their favorite shows. While the move may be difficult for some users, it could help Google become a bigger player in the podcasting space and offer more features and services to its users.

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-has-reportedly-been-blocked-on-all-congress-owned-devices-034946166.html,Microsoft Copilot has reportedly been blocked on all Congress-owned devices, Microsoft Copilot Blocked on Congress-Owned Devices for Data Security Concerns ,"The US Congress has taken steps to prevent the use of Microsoft's Copilot on government-issued devices, according to Axios. This is due to concerns about the chatbot leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services, as deemed by the Office of Cybersecurity. While personnel can still use Copilot on their personal phones and laptops, it will now be blocked on all Windows devices owned by the Congress.

This move follows a similar restriction placed on the use of ChatGPT, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models. The chatbot's free version was banned from House computers, but the paid (ChatGPT Plus) version was allowed for research and evaluation due to its tighter privacy controls. Recently, the White House introduced guidelines for federal agencies when it comes to generative AI, which will ensure that any tool used does not compromise the rights and safety of Americans.

Microsoft has recognized the need for higher security requirements for government users, and has announced a roadmap of tools and services meant for government use. These include an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant, which will feature higher levels of security suitable for handling sensitive data. The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer will evaluate the government version of Copilot when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. 

In conclusion, the US Congress is taking proactive measures to ensure the security of its data and systems, and has placed restrictions on the use of certain AI tools on government-issued devices. Microsoft has responded to this need by developing tools and services with higher levels of security, and the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer will continue to evaluate and monitor their use.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"Government AI restrictions are in place to protect data and systems.
