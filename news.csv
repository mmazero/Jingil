Introduction

As India gears up for the world's largest democracy's grand spectacle, the 2023 general election, the electoral process is marred by an insidious and growing threat: misinformation. With over 830 million internet users and a vast social media user base, India is particularly vulnerable to the dissemination of false information. This article explores the issue of misinformation in India's elections, its consequences, and potential solutions.

The Misinformation Dilemma

The proliferation of misinformation in Indian elections is not a new phenomenon. However, the deepening penetration of the internet and the rise of 'cheapfakes' since the last general election in 2019 have posed new challenges. These 'cheapfakes' refer to content generated using less sophisticated measures of altering images, videos, and audio. The misinformation crisis is not solely an election fairness concern, as it can lead to fatal consequences, including violence and an increase in hatred towards minorities.

According to Pratik Sinha, co-founder of the Indian non-profit fact-checking website Alt News, there has been a noticeable surge in the deliberate creation of misinformation with the aim of polarizing society. The diverse languages and cultures across India make it particularly challenging for fact-checkers to review and filter out misleading content.

Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network, emphasized the need for fact-checking in India, given the vast amount of misinformation. However, she also highlighted the complexities of the Indian environment, including the numerous languages spoken in the country.

Government and Big Tech's Efforts

While the Indian government has taken steps to combat misinformation, such as updating the IT intermediary rules in 2022 to require social media companies to remove misleading content within 72 hours of being reported, enforcement has been criticized as weak. The Internet Freedom Foundation has observed selective enforcement of these rules.

Tech giants such as Google and Meta have made announcements about limiting misleading content on their platforms during Indian elections and restricted AI bots from answering election queries. However, they have yet to",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/india-election-2024-getty.jpg?w=1200,2024-04-20 12:00:27,"Combat misinformation in India's elections with unified action.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/20/this-week-in-ai-when-open-source-isnt-so-open/,This Week in AI: When 'open source' isn't so open, ,"Title: Navigating the Open Source Debate in AI: Recent Developments and Considerations

Introduction

Staying current with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) can be challenging due to the rapid pace of development. This roundup highlights some recent happenings in the realm of machine learning, alongside key research and events worth noting. Most notably, Meta's release of its Llama 3 AI models and the ongoing debate surrounding true ""open source"" practices in AI.

The Controversy Surrounding Llama 3

Meta recently introduced two versions of its Llama 3 generative AI models—Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B—designed for text analysis and creation. Although Meta claims these models to be ""open source,"" certain limitations exist, such as restricted usage for training other models and separate licensing requirements for developers serving user bases exceeding 700 million monthly active users. While open source conventions generally encourage frequent releases, this instance raises questions regarding the actual meaning and implementation of open source principles.

Defining 'Open Source' in Artificial Intelligence

Achieving consensus on the precise definition of open source concerning AI remains elusive. One challenge involves applying traditional copyright mechanisms to AI components, particularly the intricate internal framework of AI models (such as embeddings). Additionally, the fundamental idea behind open source stems from granting unrestricted access to review, modify, and distribute code. However, determining essential elements for AI self-improvement is subjective, making it difficult to establish universally accepted standards.

Harmful Effects of Misleading 'Open Source' Claims

According to a joint study conducted by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the AI Now Institute, and the Signal Foundation, numerous so-called 'open source' AI initiatives have significant constraints. These include hidden proprietary datasets, excessive computational demands, and high costs associated with fine-tuning the models. In reality, most AI projects fall short of being genuinely open source, despite claiming otherwise. Consequently, large technology corporations exploiting the concept of open source may hinder the progress towards genuine decentralization and democratization of AI technologies.

Additional Noteworthy AI Stories

1. Meta enhances its conversational AI capabilities: Alongside the release of Llama 3, Meta improved its meta AI chatbots employed throughout Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp via integration with the Llama 3 backend. New functionalities encompass quicker picture rendering and enhanced internet search result incorporation.
2. Explicit AI-generated imagery scrutiny: Meta's Oversight Board, an independent policy counsel, explores ways to manage adult, AI-created visual material on Meta's online platforms better.
3. Watermarks on AI-generated pictures: Snap Inc., the firm responsible for Snapchat, intends to introduce watermarks on AI-generated photos created using its application. Users sharing or saving AI-generated images outside the platform would carry transparent Snap logos embedded with a sparkle emblem.
4. Introducing the newest Atlas: Boston Dynamics, owned by Hyundai, revealed its advanced electric humanoid Atlas robot, boasting a significantly friendlier appearance than previous generations reliant upon hydraulic mechanics.

Conclusion

Navigating the rapidly evolving AI landscape requires continuous evaluation of emerging trends, developments, and debates. As illustrated above, even seemingly straightforward concepts like ""open source"" demand deeper examination and questioning. By remaining vigilant and informed, stakeholders can foster meaningful discussions and drive innovation while adhering to ethical guidelines promoting transparency and equitable distribution of knowledge.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/llamabackground02.jpg?resize=1200,720",2024-04-20 13:15:13,"Unravel the controversy around Meta's 'open source' Llama 3 AI models and explore the challenges of defining open source in AI.

Introduction

Imagine stepping onto a United Airlines aircraft, knowing that behind the scenes, countless processes are underway to ensure your safety and comfort during the flight. From gate agents and flight attendants working tirelessly to maintain efficiency to artificial intelligence (AI) managing communication and logistics, United's technological prowess keeps everything running smoothly—most of which passengers seldom witness directly. With a strong focus on harnessing AI capabilities and optimizing cloud infrastructure, Jason Birnbaum, United's Chief Information Officer (CIO), shares his insights on how the airline industry adopts cutting-edge technologies to improve overall experiences for customers and staff alike.

The Role of Artificial Intelligence at United Airlines

As part of a broader strategy to integrate innovative solutions across various aspects of the organization, United Airlines leverages AI to streamline operations and deliver exceptional results. One such application involves utilizing AI algorithms to generate explanatory messages regarding flight delays via texts and the United mobile app. This enables real-time updates and enhanced transparency for travelers. Additionally, United recently launched its AI-powered customer service chatbot, further demonstrating the company's commitment to embracing advanced technologies.

Birnbaum emphasizes the dual nature of operating in the aviation sector: ""What I love about our business is also what you hate about the business...it isn't newsworthy if something goes awry in another industry, but here, every minute counts."" Indeed, United Airlines maintains stringent standards to minimize potential inconveniences and swiftly address operational challenges, ensuring seamless journeys for millions of passengers annually.

Optimizing Cloud Infrastructure and Developer Productivity

While exploring opportunities presented by AI integration, United Airlines remains firmly committed to enhancing its existing cloud infrastructure. As businesses worldwide strive to maximize cloud investments, numerous organizations specialize in assisting clients with cloud management, storage, and monitoring requirements. According to Birnbaum, the current era might be characterized as one centered on cloud optimization rather than digital transformation.

With Amazon Web Services (AWS) serving as its primary cloud provider, United Airlines actively pursues methods to optimize costs and bolster reliability. To achieve these objectives, the organization concentrates on improving developer productivity and incorporating automated DevOps procedures. By doing so, United aims to strike an ideal balance between minimizing expenses and maintaining top-notch functionality throughout its cloud ecosystem.

Balancing Legacy Systems and Cutting-Edge Technologies

Despite migrating several legacy systems to the cloud and decommissioning others, United Airlines acknowledges the necessity of preserving certain on-premises components. When questioned about constructing a comprehensive United Platform, Birnbaum responded emphatically: ""There's no chance we'll develop a single platform...the intricacies inherent in daily airline operations render such an endeavor impractical."" Instead, United prioritizes effective connectivity among diverse applications, enabling them to communicate efficiently and contribute to optimal performance levels.

Conclusion

By focusing on AI adoption and fine-tuning cloud infrastructure, United Airlines continues innovating to meet evolving consumer expectations and demands. Through strategic collaboration, continuous improvement efforts, and forward-thinking approaches, the company solidifies its position as a trailblazer in implementing next-generation technologies. Ultimately, United Airlines strives to deliver outstanding experiences for passengers and personnel alike, transforming air travel into a safer, smoother, and more enjoyable process.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_0412.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-04-21 15:00:01,"""Discover how United Airlines uses AI for real-time delay notifications & chatbots, optimizing cloud infrastructure.
