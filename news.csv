In the ongoing battle of the crypto wars, Graeme Biggar, the director general of the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), has urged Meta (formerly Facebook) to reconsider its implementation of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Instagram. This call follows a joint declaration by European police chiefs, expressing concerns about the expanding use of E2EE by the tech industry and its impact on law enforcement's ability to identify and act upon illegal activities.

The crux of the issue lies in the balance between privacy and public safety. Law enforcement agencies rely on access to data to protect the public from organized crime and serious threats. However, E2EE ensures that only the message's sender and recipient can access the content, making it challenging for authorities to monitor and act upon illegal activities.

Biggar asserts that while encryption is vital for cybersecurity, there should be a way for tech companies to share necessary information with law enforcement agencies, all while maintaining user privacy. He emphasizes that the NCA does not aim to stop encryption but rather to find a solution that ensures the necessary flow of information between tech companies and law enforcement agencies.

The joint declaration by European police chiefs echoes Biggar's sentiments, urging the tech industry to adopt unspecified ""technical solutions"" that would allow them to maintain the ability to spot illegal activities and report decrypted content to the authorities. One possible solution could be client-side scanning, as seen in Apple's poised-to-roll-out system for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on users' devices.

However, the implementation of such measures is not without controversy. Privacy and legal experts argue that client-side scanning and similar approaches pose an existential threat to democratic freedoms and could wreak havoc on cybersecurity. Moreover, there is a risk of generating false positives, which could cause more harm than good.

As the debate continues, it is crucial to strike a balance between user privacy and public safety. The challenge lies in finding a solution that respects individual privacy while ensuring that law enforcement agencies have the necessary tools to protect the public from organized crime and serious threats.

Introduction:
Despite the global funding winter, venture capital activity in Africa remains robust. TLcom Capital, a VC firm with offices in Lagos and Nairobi, has recently completed fundraising for its second fund, TIDE Africa Fund II, raising a total of $154 million. This achievement cements TLcom Capital's position as Africa's largest investor in seed and Series A startups.

The Fundraising and Participating Investors:
TLcom Capital's TIDE Africa Fund II, which was initially aimed to close at $150 million, exceeded its target, attracting over 20 limited partners. Notable investors include the European Investment Bank (EIB), Visa Foundation, Bertelsmann, and AfricaGrow, a joint venture between Allianz and DEG Impact. This success follows the first close of the second fund at $70 million, mirroring the size of its first fund, TIDE Africa Fund I.

Improved Understanding of Venture Capital in Africa:
Maurizio Caio, managing partner of TLcom Capital, attributes the shorter fundraising time, despite the increased fund size, to the growing understanding and acceptance of venture capital in Africa among limited partners. The firm's strategic investment approach and successful portfolio companies have also played significant roles in garnering investor confidence and support.

Consistent Investment Strategy:
Unlike many VC firms, TLcom Capital maintains a consistent investment strategy, focusing on early-stage opportunities, specifically at the seed and Series A stages. The firm supports its portfolio companies throughout their growth journey, participating in follow-on rounds at later stages.

Supporting Repeat Founders and Investing Earlier:
TLcom Capital is keen on backing repeat founders with valuable insights from their past ventures. Additionally, the firm has started investing earlier, at the pre-seed stage, creating a pipeline for its primary strategy at seed and Series A. The firm has committed to gender balance, with a majority-female partnership and investment committee, and has dedicated a portion of its funds to co-investing in female-led startups.

Current Investments and Expansion:

Introduction

In today's digital age, it's not uncommon to screenshot dating profiles and share them with friends for feedback or to discuss upcoming date plans. Recognizing this trend, Tinder has introduced a new feature that allows users to share their date details directly from the app – ""Share My Date."" This innovative tool aims to streamline the process of sharing essential date information with friends and family, ensuring a safer and more enjoyable dating experience.

What is ""Share My Date""?

Accessibility and Privacy

""Share My Date"" links can be viewed by every recipient, including non-Tinder users. Friends with Tinder accounts can view the match's full profile, but they cannot interact with it.

To prevent misuse, links expire after a certain period, discouraging users from sharing them on social media.

Inspiration and User-Centric Approach

The ""Share My Date"" feature was inspired by Tinder user data, which revealed that 51% of singles under 30 share their date plans with friends beforehand. By addressing this need, Tinder continues to create a fun, safe, and respectful experience for all its users.

In the age of high-tech camera phones, where we can instantly edit and share our photos, there's something undeniably appealing about the simplicity and unpredictability of old-school photography. Enter Mood.camera, an iPhone app that harks back to the nostalgic era of retro cameras, developed by Alex Fox.

Mood.camera is a unique app that distinguishes itself from the crowd by focusing on the charm of old-school photography. Instead of bombarding users with a myriad of editing options and live previews, this app offers a curated selection of retro filters, granular quality controls, and a distinct lack of live preview. The result is a refreshingly engaging experience that encourages users to focus on the art of taking photos rather than obsessing over the outcome.

The app's interface is thoughtfully designed to mimic the look and feel of classic cameras. Users can switch between different lenses and adjust exposure settings with ease, all from the main screen. Interestingly, Mood.camera omits the live preview feature, which is a standard in most modern camera apps. Instead, users see the same view as they would in the default camera app, adding to the app's overall charm and uniqueness.

Fox, the developer, shared his vision with TechCrunch, stating, ""Some of the design decisions I made were intended to reduce the conveniences we're used to, urging users to be in the moment instead of worrying about which filter to use or staring at their phone editing.""

The app's journey began as a prototype in October 2023, and a beta version was released on Reddit earlier this year. Over the last two months, a group of photographers has helped Fox refine the app by taking more than 100,000 photos. Users can try the app for free for seven days, after which they can choose to pay a monthly fee of $1.99 or a one-time fee of $14.99.
