https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/mit-outdoor-days/,MIT tool shows climate change could cost Texans a month and a half of outdoor time by 2080," ""Climate change: Mit tool predicts outdoor days lost by region through 2100"" ","Climate change is a complex issue that can be difficult to understand. Researchers at MIT have come up with a tool that may make it easier to comprehend the impact of climate change on different regions. The tool predicts the number of ""outdoor days"" that a region may experience from now until 2100 based on carbon emissions growth.

The results of this tool are both alarming and comforting, depending on where you live. For example, California, France, and Germany may experience milder summers and more pleasant spring and fall weather, adding several days of outdoor activity compared to historical records. However, the UK will experience the most significant increase in outdoor days, gaining 40 days by the end of the century.

On the other hand, some temperate regions like New York, Massachusetts, China, and Japan may lose a week or more of outdoor days. Illinois and Texas may lose a month and a half of outdoor days due to unbearably hot summers. It is the countries with vulnerable populations that will suffer the most, with Nigeria losing nearly two months of outdoor days and India losing almost two and a half months.

However, it is not too late to make a change. Even if the world fails to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but still manages to by 2070, the situation will improve significantly. For example, Nigeria and India will only lose one month of outdoor days, and more northerly regions will retain some of their added outdoor days.

The MIT tool is a relatable application of a field of study known as climate scenario analysis, which seeks to understand how climate change will impact various regions and demographics. Several startups are using this predictive capability to help shape an uncertain future. These startups are focused on tackling uncertainty for investors, lenders, and insurers.

Investors and insurers are sufficiently worried about how climate change will affect assets and supply chains that these startups have attracted significant funding. Jupiter Intelligence, Cervest, and One Concern have all raised millions of dollars, while ClimateAI and Sensible Weather have also attracted substantial investment.

Other markets exposed to the outdoors, such as agriculture, are also in need of solutions. ClimateAI targets agriculture, including agribusiness, lenders, and food and beverage companies, all of which have watched as droughts, floods, and storms have decimated crops. Sensible Weather provides insurance for people embarking on outdoor events and activities, allowing them to give customers an option to insure their outing against inclement weather.

As more businesses and consumers become aware of how climate change is affecting their lives, their demand for certainty will create a wealth of new markets that will offer these startups and their peers ample opportunity to expand. Climate scenario analysis, once a niche limited to academic labs and insurance companies, appears poised to enter the mainstream.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173667338.jpeg?resize=1200,768",2024-03-30 18:00:48,"Climate change tool predicts impact on outdoor days in different regions.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/,"Why AWS, Google and Oracle are backing the Valkey Redis fork"," ""Linux Foundation Hosts New Redis Fork Valkey backed by AWS, Google, Oracle"" ","The Linux Foundation announced last week that it will host Valkey, a new open-source version of Redis, a popular in-memory data store. The project was backed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap. AWS and Google Cloud rarely work together on an open-source project, but they have agreed to support this new version of Redis.

Redis, which was created in 2009 by Salvatore Sanfilippo, has been widely used in commercial and open-source deployments. In March, Redis Labs, the company that manages Redis, switched the project away from the permissive 3-clause BSD license to the more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL). This change made it incompatible with the standard definition of ""open source,"" and it was widely expected that a fork would be created.

Redis Labs CEO Rowan Trollope explained that the SSPL change opened the door for cloud service providers (CSPs) to establish fair licensing agreements with Redis Inc. Microsoft has already agreed to a commercial agreement with Redis, and Trollope said that the company is open to creating similar relationships with other cloud providers, including AWS and Google Cloud.

The new version of Redis, Valkey, was originally created by longtime Redis maintainer Madelyn Olson as a new branch of the project in her own GitHub account. The project was quickly supported by other Redis maintainers, as well as other committers who were concerned about the changes to the license. Redis Labs did not sign on to the project, but the maintainers from Redis would be welcome to join the Valkey community, according to Olson.

The Valkey project aligns with the goals of the Linux Foundation, which aims to promote open-source software and provide a neutral home for projects to thrive. The Foundation has also been actively involved in other open-source projects, including Kubernetes, OpenStack, and Node.js.

In conclusion, the creation of Valkey, a new version of Redis, is a significant development in the world of open-source software. While the decision by Redis Labs to switch to the SSPL was controversial, it opened the door for other projects to fork and develop independently.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-fabricating-high-density-vertical.html,A new strategy for fabricating high-density vertical organic electrochemical transistor arrays,High-Density OECT Arrays with Electron Beam Lithography,"

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an exciting class of transistors that have emerged in recent years. These transistors are based on organic superconducting materials, which offer several advantages over conventional transistors. However, despite their potential benefits, OECTs have several limitations that hinder their widespread use. In this article, we will discuss a new fabrication strategy developed by researchers at Northwestern University to overcome these limitations and create high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits.

OECTs have several notable advantages, including high amplification and sensing capabilities, low driving voltages, and a versatile structure. These transistors have also demonstrated potential applications in various fields, including wearable devices, biosensors, and neuromorphic systems. However, the limitations of conventional OECTs, such as limited stability and slow redox processes, have significantly impaired their performance.

Recently, a team of researchers at Northwestern University proposed a new method to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits. Their approach, which was detailed in a paper published in Nature Electronics, used electron beam lithography (eBL) to create monolithically integrated OECT structures. Electron beam lithography is a technique that uses a direct beam of electrons to create micro- and nanopatterns on semiconductor films without the use of masks or chemical solvents that could damage the materials. This method allowed the researchers to produce highly small and dense conducting channel regions while maintaining well-defined insulating areas.

To fabricate their OECT arrays, Kim, Pankow, and their colleagues exposed p- and n-channel organic semiconductor films to a direct beam of electrons. This process resulted in highly small and dense conducting channel regions with well-defined insulating areas. Moreover, the eBL strategy employed by the researchers enabled the effective multilayer integration of OECT structures into arrays and circuits. The resulting p- and n-type vertical OECT active-matrix arrays exhibited transconductances of 0.08-1.7 S, transient times of less than 100 Âµs, and stable switching properties of more than 100,000 cycles.

To further demonstrate the potential of their fabrication strategy, the researchers successfully used it to create various vertically stacked logic circuits based on their OECTs, including NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These circuits were found to perform remarkably well while also maintaining excellent operational stability.

This new approach to fabricate high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits could have significant implications for the future of OECT technology. The use of electron beam lithography could help overcome the limitations of conventional OECTs and enable the scalable fabrication of OECTs. This could, in turn, facilitate the integration of OECTs into electronic devices, leading to more diverse and sophisticated applications.

In conclusion, the fabrication strategy developed by the researchers at Northwestern University represents a significant advancement in the field of OECT technology. Their approach leverages electron beam lithography to create high-density and mechanically flexible OECT arrays and circuits, paving the way for more sophisticated and diverse applications in various fields.

With so much happening, it can be hard to stay on top of new developments and groundbreaking research. That's why we've compiled a roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable experiments and initiatives that we didn't cover on their own.
This week in AI, we're turning our attention to labeling and annotation startups. These companies are essential for the development of modern AI models, and yet they often don't get the attention or recognition they deserve. Labeling and annotation platforms are vital for training models, as they provide the labels that help the models understand and interpret data during the training process.
For example, labels for an image recognition model might take the form of markings around objects or captions referring to each person, place, or object depicted in an image. The accuracy and quality of labels significantly impact the performance and reliability of the trained models. Annotation is a massive undertaking, requiring thousands to millions of labels for larger and more sophisticated data sets.
However, the working conditions for data annotators are often brutal, with many companies relying on contractors in third-world countries who are paid only a few dollars per hour and not given the same benefits as engineers. Some annotators are exposed to highly disturbing content, yet they are not given time off or access to mental health resources.
One company, Scale AI, has been making headlines for its labeling and annotation platform. Scale AI recruits annotators in countries as far-flung as Nairobi and Kenya, and some of the tasks on the platform take labelers multiple eight-hour workdays with no breaks, paying as little as $10 per hour.
Some companies claim to provide fair-trade work, but there are no regulations or industry standards for what ethical labeling work means, and companies' definitions vary widely.
The need to annotate and label data for AI training is not going away, and while self-regulation may be an option, policymaking is the best solution for changing things for the better. While it's challenging to regulate the industry, it's the best chance we have at improving the working conditions for data annotators and ensuring ethical labeling practices.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/techcrunch-mobility-03-31-24/,Fisker enters into dumpster fire territory and Tesla chases FSD revenue," ""EV startups' struggles and successes: Fisker, Arrival, Ionobell, and Lucid"" ","Title: TechCrunch Mobility - March 27th Edition

Introduction:
Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility, where we bring you the latest news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing the recent developments at Fisker, as well as updates on Arrival, Ionobell, and Lucid. We'll also take a closer look at some of the industry news and trends.

Fisker's Struggles:
In the last edition of TechCrunch Mobility, we discussed Fisker's ongoing challenges. Since then, the company has faced even more hurdles. In March, Fisker announced that it was pausing production for six weeks and had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $32 million of that being restricted or not immediately accessible. The company was counting on a $150 million influx of capital via convertible notes and a potential partnership with another automaker. However, negotiations between Fisker and the large automaker, reportedly Nissan, fell apart, putting that convertible note deal in jeopardy.

As a result, Fisker's shares plummeted 28%, trading was halted, and the New York Stock Exchange announced that it was taking steps to remove Fisker from the exchange. This is all a symptom of a bigger problem within the company. In addition to the financial struggles, Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete.

Arrival's Assets:
In other news, Arrival, another EV startup, sold some of its assets to Canoo, another struggling startup trying to build and sell electric vehicles. While this news may not be as exciting as Fisker's struggles, it does highlight the challenges faced by many EV startups in the industry.

Ionobell's Innovative Approach:
To end on a positive note, Ionobell, a seed-stage startup, says its silicon material will be cheaper than the established competition and help boost range in EV batteries. The company recently closed an unpriced $3.9 million seed extension, with Dynamo Ventures and Trucks VC leading the round. Ionobell's innovative approach to battery technology could be a game-changer in the EV industry, making electric vehicles more affordable and accessible to a wider audience.

Lucid's Success:
Finally, Lucid, an EV startup that has had its own struggles, raised another $1 billion from its biggest financial backer, Saudi Arabia. Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock, which will add to the Kingdom's current stake of around 60% ownership. While this news may not be enough to save Fisker, it does provide Lucid with an important capital buffer as it continues to develop and bring its next vehicle, the Gravity SUV, to market.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the future of transportation is filled with both challenges and opportunities. Companies like Fisker, Ionobell, and Lucid are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the EV industry, while others like Arrival are facing their own struggles. As we continue to follow the latest developments in transportation, we'll remain committed to bringing you the most relevant and insightful information.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/the-market-is-forcing-cloud-vendors-to-relax-data-egress-fees/,The market is forcing cloud vendors to relax data egress fees," Cloud vendors soften egress fees, moving towards multi-cloud world. ","Welcome to the world of cloud computing! In recent months, the big players in the industry - Amazon, Microsoft, and Google - have softened their egress fees, which are essentially a tax on customers who want to move their data to another cloud provider. While this move may have been prompted by various factors such as a multi-cloud world, stricter regulations, and consumer backlash, it's clear that these companies are beginning to realize the error of their ways.

As John Dinsdale, chief analyst, and managing director at Synergy Research, points out, this shift is a natural progression of the market. As competition heats up, it's becoming increasingly important for cloud providers to be seen as less protectionist. Giving customers what they want is the right business strategy, and legacy companies that cling to the old ways of doing things are likely to suffer.

It's also clear that we're moving into a multi-cloud world, where data mobility is more important than ever. Jake Graham, CEO and co-founder of Bobsled, a startup that helps customers move data between clouds, has seen firsthand the challenges of migrating data across different cloud providers. He explains that while the original cloud vendors were focused on building ""walled gardens,"" they're now realizing that this approach is no longer sustainable.

Rudina Seseri, founder, and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, agrees that the shift towards less restrictive egress fees is partly due to regulatory pressure. However, she also points out that Google has used this move as a marketing tool to position itself as the less restrictive cloud provider and attract early-stage customers.

David Linthicum, a longtime cloud consultant, warns that while these recent announcements are a pleasant PR move, customers should review their bills carefully. He cautions that egress fees aren't the only problem and that customers should consider the costs holistically.

Overall, it seems that we're moving away from the ""stick"" of egress fees and towards the ""carrot"" of innovative and accessible features. This shift is likely to benefit enterprise customers and startups alike, as providers must lean further into innovative features and improved customer satisfaction to win long-term loyalty.

In conclusion, the cloud landscape is constantly evolving, and companies must be willing to adapt to changes in market dynamics.

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of its development and deployment. One of the most pressing issues facing the AI industry is the potential for bias in decision-making, which can perpetuate existing societal inequalities and injustices. To ensure that AI is built and used in a responsible and ethical manner, it is important to consider the following factors:

1. Diverse Stakeholder Engagement: In order to ensure that AI systems are built with the needs and concerns of diverse communities in mind, it is important to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including experts, policymakers, civil society organizations, and members of affected communities. This can help to identify potential biases and ethical concerns early in the development process and ensure that the system is designed to be fair and equitable.
2. Transparent Methodologies: AI systems are often opaque and difficult to understand, which can make it challenging to identify and address potential biases or ethical concerns. To promote transparency, it is important to develop clear and understandable methodologies for developing and deploying AI systems. This can include providing detailed explanations of how the system works, the data it uses, and the assumptions it makes.
3. Bias Management Strategies: Bias is an inherent part of AI systems, as they are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. To mitigate bias, it is important to develop and implement bias management strategies that can identify and mitigate potential biases in the data and algorithms used to train the system. This can include techniques such as data augmentation, fairness constraints, and regular audits.
4. Ongoing Evaluation: AI systems are not static entities, and their ethical implications can evolve over time. To ensure that AI systems remain responsible and ethical, it is important to engage in ongoing evaluation and monitoring. This can include regular audits of the system's decision-making processes, as well as ongoing engagement with stakeholders to ensure that the system continues to meet their needs and concerns.

A crucial aspect of these devices is the gate capacitance, which determines the amount of electrical charge stored relative to the applied voltage. To achieve high gate capacitance without thinning gate insulators or gate dielectrics, researchers are exploring insulating materials with high dielectric constants (Îº), such as hafnium oxide (HfO2). However, integrating these materials with 2D semiconductors has proven challenging. Researchers from Fudan University have developed a groundbreaking 2D perovskite oxide with a high-Îº value that can seamlessly integrate with various 2D channel materials, paving the way for future down-scaling of optoelectronics.

A Promising Solution: 2D Perovskite Oxide Sr2Nb3O10

In their study published in Nature Electronics, Siyuan Li, Xinya Liu, and their collaborators introduced a 2D perovskite oxide, Sr2Nb3O10, synthesized using a top-down preparation strategy. This approach enabled the successful transfer of SNO nanosheets onto various 2D materials. The high dielectric constant (Îº) of 24.6 and moderate bandgap of Sr2Nb3O10 make it an ideal photoactive high-Îº dielectric for phototransistors based on different 2D semiconducting materials, including graphene, molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, and tungsten diselenide.

Performance Evaluation and Applications

The researchers transferred the synthesized 2D perovskite oxide onto various channel materials, such as molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide, and evaluated the performance of transistors integrating these materials with Sr2Nb3O10. The findings were promising, with molybdenum disulfide transistors exhibiting an on/off ratio of 106",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/using-a-2d-perovskite.jpg,2024-04-01 06:30:01,Revolutionize your optoelectronics with 2D Perovskite Oxide: A game-changer in miniaturization!

VisionScaling: An Integrated Learning Model and Resource Optimization Algorithm for 6G Mobile Vision Services

6G mobile vision services are poised to revolutionize the way we interact with the physical world. These services, enabled by cutting-edge technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and autonomous driving, promise to deliver fast and efficient image and video capture, as well as accurate content understanding through deep learning-based models. However, this requires powerful processors (GPUs) and sophisticated learning models, which often come at the cost of high energy consumption and limited resource utilization.

Professor Jeongho Kwak from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at DGIST has developed an innovative learning model and resource optimization technology that addresses these challenges. His team's approach simultaneously optimizes learning models and computing/networking resources in real-time, leading to significant energy savings and improved performance.

The VisionScaling algorithm, developed by Professor Kwak's team, uses 'Online Convex Optimization (OCO),' a dynamic optimization technique, to adapt to constantly changing mobile environments, even without prior knowledge of future conditions. The algorithm is capable of reducing energy consumption by at least 30% while maintaining average accuracy compared to current technologies.

Furthermore, the researchers tested the algorithm in real-world mobile vision service environments using embedded AI devices and connected edge computing platforms. They confirmed that the VisionScaling algorithm saved 30% more energy in mobile devices and improved end-to-end latency by 39% compared to previously used algorithms.

Professor Kwak stated, ""This research provides both practical and mathematical contributions to the field. It not only verifies the performance of our algorithm in irregularly changing mobile environments but also demonstrates the potential of dynamic optimization and learning techniques for deep learning-based mobile services in the future.""

The research is published in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

Introduction:

In the digital age, email has become an integral part of our lives. Gmail, the free web-based email service developed by Google, has revolutionized the way we communicate and manage our emails. Today, we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Gmail's launch on April Fool's Day in 2004. In this article, we will explore the history of Gmail, its features, and its impact on the world of email.

Body:

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were known for their pranks, and they used April Fool's Day to unveil something that nobody would believe was possible - Gmail. With its 1 gigabyte of storage per account, it was an unheard-of amount of email capacity that could store about 13,500 emails before running out of space compared to just 30 to 60 emails in the then-leading webmail services run by Yahoo and Microsoft. This translated into 250 to 500 times more email storage space.

Besides the quantum leap in storage, Gmail also came equipped with Google's search technology, allowing users to quickly retrieve a tidbit from an old email, photo, or other personal information stored on the service. It also automatically threaded together a string of communications about the same topic, so everything flowed together as if it was a single conversation.

The original pitch put together by Page and Brin was all about the three 'S's - storage, search, and speed. The idea of a web-based email service with such features was mind-bending, and it changed people's perceptions about the kinds of applications that were possible within a web browser.

Former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who helped design Gmail and other company products, said that the original Gmail was all about the three 'S's. It was such a mind-bending concept that shortly after The Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on the afternoon of April Fool's 2004, readers began calling and emailing to inform the news agency that it had been duped by Google's pranksters.

However, the AP knew that Google wasn't joking about Gmail, as an AP reporter had been abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make the trip worthwhile. After arriving at the still-developing corporate campus that would soon blossom into what became known as the ""Googleplex,"" the AP reporter was ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while sitting in front of his laptop computer.

Page, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail's sleekly designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within Microsoft's now-retired Explorer web browser. And he pointed out that there was no delete button featured in the main control window because it wouldn't be necessary, given Gmail had so much storage and could be so easily searched. ""I think people are really going to like this,"" Page predicted.

As with so many other things, Page was right. Gmail now has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts, each one offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. Even though that's 15 times more storage than Gmail initially offered, it's still not enough for many users who rarely see the need to purge their accounts, just as Google hoped.

The digital hoarding of email, photos, and other content is why Google, Apple, and other companies now make money from selling additional storage capacity in their data centers. (In Google's case, it charges anywhere from $30 annually for 200 gigabytes of storage to $250 annually for 5 terabytes of storage). Gmail's existence has revolutionized the way we communicate and manage our emails, and it has become an integral part of our lives.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Gmail's 20th anniversary is a significant milestone in the history of email.

Like many other investors, Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo, the veteran members of GGV Capital, recently decided to split their U.S. and Asia operations. The two brands that emerged from this split, Granite Asia and Notable Capital, signal a new era in investment strategies that are tailored to specific geographic regions.

Granite Asia, led by Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo, will focus on startups in China, Japan, South Asia, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Lee, a regular fixture on Forbes's Midas List of top-performing VCs, has a track record of successful investments in the region, including Xiaomi, Kingsoft WPS, and Didi. Foo, on the other hand, has an impressive portfolio that includes Xpeng Motors, Didi, and Grab.

Notable Capital, which says it plans to continue investing in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, is being led by the same investors who have been based in its Menlo Park office for many years. The team includes Hans Tung, who is Taiwanese-American and has a record of successful investments in known brands like Airbnb, StockX, and Slack. Jeff Richards, another member of the team, has backed Coinbase, Tile, and Handshake, among others. Glenn Solomon, another investor, has a portfolio that includes HashiCorp, Opendoor, and Drata.

It's worth noting that Oren Yunger, the newest member of GGV Capital, remains on team Notable. Yunger had joined GGV as an investor in 2018 and was promoted to managing director last fall.

Meanwhile, Eric Xu, another longtime managing director at GGV Capital, will continue to oversee the original firm's independently operated yuan-denominated funds.

This move signifies a shift in investment strategies that are tailored to specific geographic regions. The investors have split their assets under management, along with the capital raised prior, such that Granite Asia is now managing a collective $5 billion altogether, leaving Notable Capital with roughly $4.2 billion based on GGV Capital's assets under management at the time the split was announced.

In conclusion, the split of GGV Capital's U.S. and Asia operations marks a new era in investment strategies that are tailored to specific geographic regions. The two new brands, Granite Asia and Notable Capital, are poised to make a significant impact on the startup ecosystem, and the success of their investments will be closely watched by investors and industry experts alike.
