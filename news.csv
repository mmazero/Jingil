https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/ransomware-attack-change-healthcare-prescription-pharmacy-outages/,Ransomware attack blamed for Change Healthcare outage stalling US prescriptions,"

In a recent cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a leading US healthcare technology company, hospitals and pharmacies across the country experienced disruptions and outages. The culprit behind this attack has been identified as the notorious BlackCat ransomware group, also known as ALPHV.

The cyberattack, which began on February 21st, caused widespread disruptions in the healthcare system. Change Healthcare, a major processor of prescription medications, took its systems offline to combat the attack, resulting in the inability to fulfill or process prescriptions through patients' insurance.

BlackCat, a ransomware and extortion group, typically encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom for the decryption key. In this case, it's unclear whether patient data was stolen before encryption.

UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Change Healthcare, initially attributed the attack to a ""suspected nation-state"" actor, but the accuracy of this claim remains uncertain. Cybersecurity researchers have not previously linked BlackCat to any specific government or state.

The attack has had significant consequences, with hospitals, healthcare providers, and pharmacies unable to fulfill or process prescriptions. The American Hospital Association advised its members to disconnect from Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, until it's deemed safe to reconnect.

BlackCat has previously targeted other major organizations, including Norton, Reddit, and Fidelity National Financial.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-social-media-moderation-texas-florida/,The Supreme Court could decide the future of content moderation - or it could punt,"[START OF GENERATED BLOG]

In the realm of the digital world, where social media platforms reign supreme, a battle is brewing in the hallowed hall of the Supreme Court. Two state laws, hailing from Florida and Texas, have ignited a fierce debate over the fate of content moderation on these virtual frontiers.

At the heart of the matter lies the question: Should social media companies face restrictions on the content they moderate on their platforms? The Supreme Court justices, grappling with this intricate web of arguments, face a daunting task in determining the future of online expression and the role of these digital behemoths in our information landscape.

The laws in question, enacted by Republican governors, aim to limit the ability of social media companies to remove or restrict certain types of content. They argue that these platforms harbor an anti-conservative bias, leading to the unfair censorship of conservative voices. However, research has failed to substantiate these claims, leaving many to question the true motivations behind these legislative efforts.

The justices engaged in a lively exchange during oral arguments, expressing skepticism about the broad nature of these state laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor voiced concerns that the laws could have unintended consequences, potentially impacting a wide range of online platforms beyond traditional social media. Justice Neil Gorsuch, while appearing more receptive to arguments against the social networks, acknowledged the potential conflict with Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for user-generated content.

The justices' deliberations revealed a spectrum of opinions, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito seemingly more inclined towards the states' arguments. Justice Alito even questioned whether content moderation was merely a euphemism for censorship, hinting at the complexities of defining the boundaries of free expression in the digital age.

Adding to the intrigue, several justices raised doubts about the manner in which the cases were brought before the court. They pointed out the lack of a full trial, which would typically provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the laws operate in practice. This procedural issue could potentially lead to the cases being remanded to lower courts for further proceedings, prolonging the legal battle.

The Supreme Court's decision, expected sometime before the end of its term in June, holds immense significance for the future of content moderation and the role of social media companies in our society. It could either provide much-awaited clarity or leave the issue unresolved, sending it back to lower courts for further deliberation.

Regardless of the outcome, the Supreme Court's engagement with this case marks a pivotal moment in addressing the legal challenges posed by the internet age. The court's ruling will undoubtedly shape the landscape of online expression, influencing how social media companies navigate the delicate balance between protecting free speech and ensuring responsible content moderation.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/inkitt-ai-publishing-37-million/,"Inkitt, a self-publishing platform using AI to develop bestsellers, books $37M led by Khosla","

In a world of endless distractions, Inkitt, a pioneering startup, believes in the enduring power of storytelling. Its mission is to harness the potential of AI to transform compelling stories into blockbusters, aiming to become the ""Disney of the 21st century.""

With its eponymous app, Inkitt empowers aspiring authors to self-publish their stories. Through a combination of AI and data science, the platform identifies the most captivating tales, refines them, and distributes them on a separate app called Galatea. This innovative approach has garnered an impressive 33 million users and produced numerous bestsellers.

The company's latest funding round, a Series C of $37 million, will fuel its expansion into diverse content formats. Inkitt plans to leverage AI to craft stories based on original ideas, personalize fiction for individual readers, venture into games and audiobooks, and adapt its published works into engaging video content. Initially produced with human involvement, these videos will eventually be generated entirely by AI.

CEO and founder Ali Albazaz envisions Inkitt as a multimedia empire, a modern-day Disney that surpasses competitors like Wattpad. This ambitious goal is fueled by the belief that AI can revolutionize the way we consume and experience stories.

Despite the decline in traditional reading habits due to the dominance of mobile devices and short-form content, Inkitt is betting against the trend. It aims to capture readers' attention by delivering books in innovative ways. Shorter chapters optimized for mobile reading, dynamic text effects, and A/B testing of every aspect of a story ensure an immersive and engaging experience tailored to readers' preferences.

Inkitt's data-driven approach has proven successful. While many pandemic-era services have seen a decline in engagement, Inkitt, Galatea, and Galatea TV have experienced a surge in usage. Albazaz attributes this growth to people seeking escapism in a chaotic world.

Inkitt's achievements are remarkable. It ranks among the top 11 bestselling publishers globally, surpassing established names like Penguin Random House. Its algorithm-driven approach reportedly yields a 20x higher success rate in publishing bestsellers compared to traditional publishers. Revenues have doubled in the past year, and newer ventures like Galatea TV are generating substantial returns.

Inkitt's focus is on fiction, but it steers clear of literary heavyweights. Albazaz prefers to nurture undiscovered talent, avoiding the challenges of working with established authors and their egos. The company is exploring the potential of AI-generated stories, crafted from captivating treatments by human writers. Personalizing stories using AI algorithms is another area of experimentation, with varying degrees of changes implemented in original works.

To realize its vision, Inkitt utilizes a range of LLMs, including APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI. These tools are customized to suit Inkitt's specific needs, and each book is automatically translated into 10 languages using DeepL AI. ElevenLabs provides text-to-speech voices for audiobooks, while Leonardo handles cover art.

Alabazaz emphasizes the limitations of LLMs, stating that they alone cannot create best-selling content. Inkitt's data-driven insights, accumulated over years, play a crucial role in refining AI-generated stories. Additionally, Inkitt employs strategic prompting techniques to prevent LLMs from learning too much about its best-performing works, safeguarding intellectual property.

Inkitt's unique approach has attracted the attention of prominent investors. Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, a lead investor in the Series C round, believes in the potential of AI-driven, hyper-personalized entertainment. He sees Inkitt's mission as a perfect fit for this vision.

Inkitt's journey is a testament to the transformative power of AI in storytelling. As it continues to push boundaries and explore new frontiers, the company is poised to redefine the way we consume and experience entertainment in the digital age.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/faa-completes-investigation-into-spacexs-second-fiery-starship-test/,FAA completes investigation into SpaceX's second fiery Starship test,"

In the realm of space exploration, SpaceX's Starship program has captured the imagination of enthusiasts worldwide. Following the second Starship launch in November, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has concluded its review of SpaceX's investigation, accepting the company's identified root causes and corrective actions.

While this marks the conclusion of the investigation, SpaceX must diligently implement all corrective measures and apply for a modified launch license before resuming Starship flights. The FAA is currently evaluating SpaceX's license modification request, expecting additional information before making a final determination.

The second orbital flight test of the colossal Starship rocket, standing at nearly 400 feet tall, surpassed the first test in several remarkable ways. All 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster ignited successfully, completing a nearly three-minute ascent burn without any failures. The company also achieved a challenging ""hot-stage separation,"" where the Starship upper stage ignited to separate from the booster.

However, like the first test in April, the flight ended in a fiery explosion mid-air, prompting the FAA to initiate a mishap investigation. Led by SpaceX and reviewed by regulators, these investigations ensure thorough analysis and implementation of corrective actions. After the first test, SpaceX was directed to complete 63 corrective actions.

The company identified seven changes to the booster and ten to the Starship vehicle. These modifications include hardware redesigns to enhance tank filtration and reduce slosh, updated modeling for the thrust vector control system, reevaluation of engine analyses, and improved engine control algorithms. Additionally, SpaceX implemented hardware changes to increase robustness and reduce complexity, reduce leaks, eliminate pre-second engine cutoff propellant dumps, update flammability analysis, install additional fire protection, and create analytical guidance.

In a post-launch postmortem, SpaceX shed light on some of these corrective actions. The likely cause of the booster's explosion was a filter blockage in one of the Raptor engines, leading to a catastrophic engine failure. The Starship upper stage encountered a propellant leak, causing a fire that disrupted communication between onboard computers and ultimately triggered the autonomous flight termination system.

SpaceX has already incorporated some of these hardware changes and design upgrades into the vehicles intended for the third orbital flight test. CEO Elon Musk hinted that this mission could take place as early as the second week of March.

SpaceX's ultimate goal is to complete the full mission profile, which involves the Super Heavy booster executing a ""boost back burn"" and a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while Starship circumnavigates the globe and lands in the Pacific Ocean.

Through iterative improvements and relentless pursuit of innovation, SpaceX aims to develop a fully reusable launch system capable of transporting satellites, payloads, crew, and cargo to various orbits and landing sites on Earth, the Moon, and Mars.

Qatar's Bold Move: A $1 Billion Fund for Venture Capital

In a bid to reshape Qatar's entrepreneurial landscape, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has unveiled an ambitious $1 billion venture capital fund of funds. This strategic move aims to attract international venture capital funds and startups to Qatar and the wider Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The fund will focus on fintech, edtech, and healthcare sectors, sectors poised for exponential growth.

QIA's initiative will invest indirectly through other VC funds, mirroring typical fund-of-funds structures. However, it will also make targeted co-investments with participating funds. This dual approach aims to boost the number of startups and enhance the availability of venture capital funding within Qatar. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap with neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have more established ecosystems.

In recent years, Gulf sovereign wealth funds have shown a growing appetite for tech startups in the GCC region. This trend reflects their desire to diversify their portfolios and reduce reliance on oil. In 2022 alone, Gulf SWFs collectively invested over $73 billion across various asset classes. Saudi Arabia has taken the lead in this regard, establishing dedicated funds like Jada and Saudi Venture Capital.

QIA's fund of funds stands out as the first of its kind in the region, focusing exclusively on venture capital funds. This strategic move underscores Qatar's commitment to fostering a vibrant startup ecosystem. QIA CEO Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud emphasized the importance of creating a well-connected startup network to diversify the country's economy in the long term.

To qualify for funding, fund managers must demonstrate a strong track record and actively engage in the Gulf's VC and startup ecosystem. This includes establishing operations and a senior-level presence in Qatar, as well as outlining expansion plans across the GCC. This directive aligns with the aspirations of fund managers and venture capitalists who seek capital from limited partners in the Middle East.

Historically, Gulf wealth funds have invested in foreign startups, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, with limited connections to the Gulf region. QIA's investments in ventures like Builder.ai, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail, and notable Indian startups like Swiggy and Flipkart exemplify this trend.

The launch of QIA's venture capital fund of funds marks a significant step in Qatar's journey towards economic diversification. By attracting international VC funds and startups, Qatar aims to create a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem that drives innovation and economic growth. As the fund deploys its capital, it will be fascinating to witness how it shapes the region's startup landscape and contributes to the broader transformation of Qatar's economy.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/instagram-confirms-developing-snap-map-like-friend-map-feature/,Instagram is working on a 'Friend Map' feature that would let you track friends' locations,"

Instagram's latest move involves the development of a ""Friend Map"" feature, an exciting concept similar to Snapchat's Snap Map. This opt-in feature allows users to view their friends' locations in real-time, creating a more connected and interactive social experience.

The Friend Map feature is currently an internal prototype, and Instagram has not yet announced plans for an official launch. However, the potential implications are intriguing. If Instagram decides to roll it out, it would mark another instance of the platform replicating successful features from its competitors, following the adoption of Stories from Snapchat in 2016.

The introduction of the Friend Map would also put Instagram in direct competition with Apple's ""Find My"" map feature, which enables users to track the locations of their friends and family. This move could potentially attract users who prefer the convenience of having all their social and location-sharing needs met within a single app.

Additionally, Instagram has an opportunity to tap into the user base of Zenly, a social map app that was acquired and subsequently shut down by Snap last year. Zenly's popularity among users who enjoy sharing their locations with friends could make Instagram's Friend Map a compelling alternative.

The Friend Map feature is designed with privacy in mind. Users can choose who can see their location, with options ranging from followers who follow them back, their ""Close Friends"" list, or no one at all. Additionally, a ""Ghost Mode"" setting allows users to hide their last active location.

Beyond location sharing, the Friend Map also incorporates ""Notes,"" short messages that appear on the map for others to see. These Notes can be used to notify friends about exciting discoveries, such as pop-up shops or new restaurants.

Instagram's efforts to enhance its in-app map offering align with a broader trend among younger users. Research suggests that young people increasingly rely on platforms like Instagram and TikTok for discovering new places, rather than traditional search engines or map apps.

With the Friend Map feature, Instagram aims to capitalize on this trend and further solidify its position as a hub for social interaction, location sharing, and local discovery. Whether it will succeed in taking on Snapchat and Apple remains to be seen, but the potential for a more connected and engaging social experience is undeniable.

In a bid to challenge its rival Twitter, Instagram's Threads app is evolving to offer a more comprehensive and engaging experience. The latest additions to Threads include trending topics, an in-app camera, drafts, and a bookmarking feature.

The bookmarking feature, in particular, has been highly anticipated by users who value the ability to save posts for future reference. Unlike public ""likes,"" bookmarks provide a private way to curate a collection of links and posts that you might want to revisit later. This feature is particularly useful for saving long articles, important information, or posts that you want to share with friends or colleagues.

While bookmarking is easily accessible on Twitter, Threads has taken a slightly different approach. Instead of placing the bookmark icon at the bottom of the post, Threads users need to tap on the three-dot menu to access the ""Save"" option. To view your saved posts, you'll need to navigate to the app's Settings screen.

Instagram is rolling out these new features in phases, so not all Threads users will have immediate access. This phased approach is due to the app's sizable user base of 130 million monthly active users and the limited engineering resources allocated to Threads compared to other Meta projects.

In addition to bookmarks, Threads users have also noticed other changes, such as receiving notifications from Threads and Facebook in their Instagram notifications. The company has also confirmed that it's testing a cross-posting feature from Facebook to Threads, further integrating the two platforms.

These updates demonstrate Instagram's commitment to enhancing the Threads experience and attracting new users. By incorporating popular features from Twitter and offering unique functionalities, Threads aims to establish itself as a strong competitor in the social media landscape.

In the realm of business and investment, the year 2024 promises to be a tumultuous ride, shaped by a confluence of external events that will shake the very foundations of industries and markets. From the unpredictable outcomes of democratic elections to the ever-evolving geopolitical landscape and the relentless acceleration of artificial intelligence, the world is poised for a transformative journey.

Topping the list of concerns among business leaders, as revealed at the World Economic Forum, are three major factors: a ""super year"" of democratic elections, the intricacies of geopolitics and war, and the rapid advancement of AI. These factors will intertwine, creating a complex tapestry of challenges and opportunities for businesses and investors alike.

Beyond these primary concerns, a multitude of secondary questions arise, each with the potential to reshape the global landscape. Will inflation finally subside, or will it continue to cast its shadow over economies? Where will interest rates settle, and how will they impact borrowing costs and investment decisions? Will voters embrace climate policies that may lead to higher energy prices, or will they resist such measures? And can we trust China's reported GDP growth of 5.2% in 2023?

In a typical year, these secondary questions would dominate the headlines. However, 2024 stands out as an exceptional year, where external influences will take center stage, driving change at an unprecedented pace and amplifying risks across industries.

The temptation to hunker down, reduce risk exposure, and focus solely on cash flow optimization may seem like a prudent strategy in such an uncertain environment. However, adopting a purely risk-averse approach could inadvertently hinder progress and stifle innovation. As Justin Doebele, the editor of this magazine, aptly observes, 2024 will witness the emergence of new paradigms, driven by the relentless march of AI and the evolving preferences of younger consumers. These forces will inevitably disrupt traditional business models, challenging established norms and creating opportunities for those willing to embrace change.

The recent downfall of once-prominent media outlets, the decline of independent restaurants, and the collapse of office real estate, all occurring amidst a seemingly healthy U.S. economy, serve as stark reminders of the underlying currents of change that can swiftly reshape industries. These events underscore the importance of staying vigilant, adapting to evolving market dynamics, and embracing innovation as a means of staying ahead of the curve.

Among the major risks that 2024 holds, elections stand out as a significant factor with the potential to reshape the global landscape. With over 60 countries and territories scheduled to hold elections this year, the stakes are incredibly high. The outcome of these elections will determine the direction of policies, economic priorities, and international relations, with far-reaching implications for businesses and investors.

Some two billion people will cast their votes for national leaders in 2024, including pivotal elections in India, the United States, and Mexico. The European Union, a massive economic bloc with a GDP of nearly $20 trillion, will also hold parliamentary elections, potentially shaping the future of the region.

The upcoming U.S. elections, in particular, present a stark contrast of visions. President Joe Biden's first term has been marked by significant federal intervention, including the $3 trillion Inflation Reduction Act, which has drawn mixed reactions. His potential rival, Donald Trump, represents a different set of policies and values, appealing to a segment of the population that feels threatened by the perceived erosion of their freedoms.

Recent polls reveal a significant divide between the views of the elite and the general public on issues such as climate change policies and restrictions on personal choices. This divide highlights the growing polarization within societies and the potential for social unrest if these issues are not addressed thoughtfully and inclusively.

While the idea of Trump winning the U.S. presidency may seem absurd to some, the underlying sentiments of his supporters cannot be ignored. They feel marginalized and under attack, their freedoms slipping away. This sentiment has the potential to fuel political instability and further divide societies.

In this high-risk environment, schadenfreude, or the pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others, may provide temporary satisfaction, but it does little to contribute to global prosperity and peace. Instead, it is essential to engage in constructive dialogue, bridge divides, and work towards solutions that benefit all stakeholders.

As we navigate the complexities of 2024, it is imperative to remain adaptable, embrace change, and seek opportunities amidst the challenges. By staying informed, making informed decisions, and working collaboratively, we can weather the storms and emerge stronger on the other side.
