Introduction

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been the subject of extensive research due to their unique advantages, such as light weight, good mechanical flexibility, and transparency. A key challenge in the development of OSCs lies in optimizing their efficiency. Researchers at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have proposed an innovative strategy to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ternary OSCs by minimizing non-radiative voltage losses through careful selection and design of guest components.

The Ternary Strategy and Voltage Losses

The ternary strategy, which involves introducing a guest component into a host binary system, has emerged as an effective method to achieve high-performance OSCs. Despite the development of various efficient guest components, there is still no reliable way to predict their impact on device efficiency.

In this study, Prof. Ge Ziyi's research group focused on addressing voltage losses, a critical issue that hinders the performance of ternary OSCs. Voltage losses occur due to non-radiative recombination, which reduces the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and, consequently, the overall efficiency of the device. To minimize voltage losses, the team proposed a new approach: increasing the electrostatic potential (ESP) difference between the guest acceptor and the host acceptor.

Designing Asymmetrical Non-Fullerene Acceptors (ANFs)

To test their hypothesis, the researchers designed and synthesized three asymmetrical non-fullerene acceptors (ANFs) with distinct ESP distributions: ANF-1, ANF-2, and ANF-3. These ANFs were then introduced as guest acceptors into the well-established D18:N3 host system. The team carefully examined the effects of introducing the guest component on the photovoltaic properties of the resulting ternary films.

Impact of ESP Difference on Ternary OSC Performance

Experimental results revealed that a significant ESP difference between the guest acceptor and the host system leads to stronger intermolecular interactions and higher miscibility of the two molecules.

An international team of scientists has recently uncovered a breakthrough in battery design that could pave the way for safer and more powerful lithium batteries. This groundbreaking discovery was made possible by utilizing quasi-elastic neutron scattering at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to establish the first benchmark - one nanosecond, or one billionth of a second - for a lithium salt and organic polymer electrolyte mixture.

According to Eugene Mamontov, ORNL Chemical Spectroscopy group leader, polymer electrolytes have a significant advantage over liquid electrolytes in lithium batteries, as they are less prone to catching fire. This critical distinction could lead to the development of safer, energy-dense batteries, which, in turn, could enable the use of more powerful lithium batteries with lithium metal electrodes.

The team's neutron technique validated computer simulations, settling a long-standing debate about the time it takes for lithium ions to break free from the tiny cages created by polymer electrolytes. The rate at which ions disengage from their environments significantly impacts energy flow within batteries. By using polymer electrolytes, scientists can potentially enable more energy-dense electrodes, leading to more powerful lithium batteries.

The findings also open up new opportunities for quickly screening new battery materials at ORNL. ""Neutrons are highly sensitive to hydrogen, which is present in virtually all electrolytes,"" said Naresh Osti, ORNL neutron scattering scientist. ""This allowed us to observe hydrogen movement in the system and understand polymer electrolyte dynamics at an unprecedented level of detail. We couldn't have pinpointed the time and length any other way.""

Nitash Balsara, Charles W. Tobias Professor of Electrochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, further commented that the interpretation of neutron data from the ORNL experiment had shed new light on understanding the extent to which lithium ions are confined in polymer electrolytes. The findings suggest that this general approach will also apply to liquid electrolytes.

Introduction

Hydrogen, with its high energy density and potential as a clean energy carrier, is expected to play a significant role in the future low-carbon economy. However, the challenge of finding efficient and safe storage solutions has been a major obstacle in the widespread adoption of hydrogen power. Researchers from Skoltech, Shubnikov Institute of Crystallography of RAS, and various international research centers have made a groundbreaking discovery of a material for chemical storage of hydrogen that can absorb four times as much of this gas as current top contenders. This article will delve into the details of this revolutionary breakthrough and its implications for the future of hydrogen energy.

The Hydrogen Dilemma

Hydrogen, being the lightest and smallest molecule, presents unique challenges in terms of storage and containment. The existing methods of compressing or liquefying hydrogen for storage are expensive, energy-intensive, and have limited energy density compared to natural gas. Additionally, hydrogen is highly reactive and can easily escape from containers, causing safety concerns.

The Alternative: Chemical Storage

An alternative approach to physical storage is chemical storage, where hydrogen is absorbed into the crystal structure of certain materials, such as metal alloys. These materials, known as hydrogen accumulators, provide relatively dense and safe storage and release hydrogen upon demand when heated. However, their hydrogen storage capacity is limited due to the physical constraints of the metal lattice structure.

The New Hydrogen-Rich Compounds: Cesium Heptahydride and Rubidium Nonahydride

Meta, WhatsApp's parent company, announced this exciting new feature on Tuesday. The update introduces a filter function at the top of the chat list, enabling users to choose between three views: All, Unread, and Groups.

The 'All' view, which is the default setting, displays all messages as usual. The 'Unread' view, however, offers a more streamlined approach by showing only the messages you haven't yet read, highlighting the ones requiring your attention or response. This view covers messages you haven't opened as well as those you've marked as unread for future reference.

For those more interested in group discussions, the 'Groups' view is a perfect fit. It consolidates all group chats in one place, making it a breeze to access and contribute to ongoing conversations. Moreover, this view also includes subgroups of any community discussion groups you've joined.

While WhatsApp already features a way to filter between read and unread messages, these new filters promise to be more user-friendly and efficient. According to WhatsApp, ""We believe filters will make it easier to stay organized, find your most important conversations, and navigate through messages more efficiently."" The filters are currently in the process of being rolled out and will be available to all users in the coming weeks.

In addition to chat filters, Meta has also integrated its Meta AI chatbot into WhatsApp. This helpful assistant can answer general questions and guide users to specific features. To use the chatbot, simply tap the search field in your chat list, and it will appear to assist you in finding messages containing particular types of content, such as photos, videos, links, documents, and GIFs.

By providing these new tools, WhatsApp continues to enhance user experience and promote efficiency in managing conversations. WhatsApp users can look forward to a more organized and productive messaging experience in the near future.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/38bb93208d7b271813389870be58b84a3874bc93/2024/04/17/091c880c-6c92-4a25-8f1f-75c4908e8181/figure-top-whatsapp-adds-chat-filters-to-help-you-more-easily-find-specific-messages.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-17 00:00:00,"Discover WhatsApp's game-changing chat filters!

Title: Meta's Ad Model Shaken: EDPB Bans 'Consent or Pay', What Now?","Title: Meta's Advertising Model Faces Major Overhaul: An In-depth Look

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) might soon bring significant changes to Meta's advertising business model in the European Union. According to recent reports, large digital platforms like Facebook and Instagram won't be allowed to present users with a 'consent or pay' model, effectively taking away Meta's preferred method of obtaining user permissions for data usage. This article explores the potential impact of these impending changes on Meta's ad-based revenue streams and delves into alternative strategies the tech giant may consider.

  

Binary Choice vs. Compliance With EU Law

Recently, the EDPB convened to discuss adopting an advisory stance concerning the legality of the 'consent or pay' model—a practice where companies offer free services while charging fees for ad-free experiences. Two individuals familiar with the matter informed Politico that the board concluded large platforms couldn't rely solely on this approach without violating EU regulations.

Once the official EDPB opinion is released, we expect closer scrutiny of Meta's current practices. Should the document substantiate earlier claims, Meta will likely face pressure to alter its existing methods to meet EU compliance standards, potentially affecting millions of European users who currently opt for ad-free experiences.

  

Meta's History and Current Challenges

Following regulatory decisions invalidating two previous legal grounds for handling user information, Meta introduced a subscription service across Europe in late 2021. Claiming legitimate consent under GDPR, Meta offered ad-free versions of their social media platforms; however, critics argue that the presented choice remains flawed due to its inherent limitations.

Within the 'consent or pay' model, users either accept Meta's use of their personal data for tailored advertising or subscribe to a premium tier devoid of ads. Although Meta initiated the pricing structure at €13 ($14) per month and subsequently lowered it, opposition persists among privacy advocates and consumers alike. Concerns include the lack of transparency surrounding data management and the limited influence users hold over their own private information.

Additionally, both EU legislators and the European Commission question Meta's implementation of the system amid concerns around conformity with the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Under DMA provisions, in-scope platforms require explicit approval for utilizing user data during ad campaigns. Furthermore, doubts linger regarding Meta's assertion of gaining consent through the Digital Services Act (DSA).

Although crucial, the EDPB's upcoming advisement focuses primarily on Meta's alignment with established EU data protection protocols rather than addressing broader legislation concerns. As a result, anticipation builds around the level of insight provided by the board's detailed assessment of Meta's current approach.

  

Potential Implications and Alternatives

If the EDPB rules against Meta's practices, the tech titan will need to explore alternate avenues to maintain profitability and continue operating within EU jurisdiction. Several possibilities exist to navigate these challenges, including:

1. Contextual Advertising: By focusing on relevant, location-specific, or time-bound promotional material instead of individualized behavioral targeting, Meta can preserve its primary source of income while respecting user preferences.
   
2. Sponsored Content: Revenue generation via sponsored articles, videos, or influencer marketing allows businesses to thrive alongside platform growth without resorting to invasive tracking techniques.
   
3. Privacy-Focused Models: Pursuing innovative solutions centered on secure encryption and minimal metadata collection ensures sustainable monetization while upholding stringent data protection principles.

By embracing change and exploring new opportunities, Meta stands poised to address growing concerns around user privacy and safeguard its market presence simultaneously. While uncertainty looms ahead, fresh approaches promise prosperous resolutions that cater to all parties involved.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-facebook-snapchat-project-ghostbusters.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-17 13:00:52,"Meta Model Overhaul: EU Privacy Body Rules Out 'Consent or Pay' Tactic

","Title: A Monumental Discovery: The Largest Stellar Black Hole in the Milky Way

In the heart of our Milky Way galaxy resides a supermassive black hole, but it is far from alone. Scattered throughout the galaxy are smaller stellar black holes, the remnants of massive stars that have undergone gravitational collapse. Estimates suggest there are around 100 million of these stellar black holes in our galaxy, yet only a fraction have been discovered. Recently, the European Space Agency's Gaia mission has led to the detection of a truly exceptional stellar black hole, and its implications are revolutionizing our understanding of the universe.

Stellar black holes are typically around 10 times the size of our sun. However, Gaia BH3, as it has been named, is an awe-inspiring 33 solar masses, making it the largest stellar black hole ever discovered in the Milky Way. Moreover, Gaia BH3 is relatively close to Earth, situated approximately 1,926 light-years away. To put that into perspective, it is the second-closest known black hole to our planet.

The European Space Agency's Gaia mission collected data that revealed an old giant star in the nearby Aquila constellation exhibiting an intriguing wobble. Upon further investigation, scientists discovered that the star was orbiting a massive black hole. Gaia BH3 proved to be elusive, given its lack of nearby celestial bodies to feed it matter and emit X-rays detectable by telescopes. Before its discovery, black holes of comparable size had only been found in distant galaxies.

To confirm the size of Gaia BH3, scientists utilized data from ground-based telescopes such as the European Southern Observatory. They have also published preliminary findings, with a more comprehensive analysis to follow in 2025. Initial observations indicate that the star orbiting it has minimal elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This suggests that the star that collapsed to form Gaia BH3 may have had a similar composition.

The discovery of Gaia BH3 has profound implications for our understanding of stellar evolution. Scientists have long theorized that metal-poor stars, those with fewer elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, are capable of creating high-mass",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yAmL17Kezyz5jOyjxfMV2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODQ-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/e6fd2750-fc8e-11ee-ade6-22992fce4792,2024-04-17 08:57:53,"""Discover the biggest stellar black hole in the Milky Way - Gaia BH3!
