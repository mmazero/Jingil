President Joe Biden's Executive Order (EO) on Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been five months old, and the White House is now taking another step forward by implementing a policy that aims to regulate the federal government's use of AI. The policy emphasizes the importance of safeguards that agencies must have in place to mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias, protect the public from potential harm while ensuring everyone can enjoy the benefits of AI.

""All leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector have a moral, ethical, and societal duty to make sure that artificial intelligence is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm while ensuring everyone is able to enjoy its benefits,"" Vice President Kamala Harris announced on a press call.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued three binding requirements under the new policy. Firstly, agencies must ensure that any AI tools they use ""do not endanger the rights and safety of the American people."" They have until December 1st to make sure they have in place ""concrete safeguards"" to mitigate the risk of harm and protect the public. Secondly, the policy stipulates that an AI system is deemed to impact safety if it is used or expected to be used to control or significantly influence the outcomes of activities and decisions such as maintaining election integrity and voting infrastructure, controlling critical safety functions of infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and operating the physical movements of robots in various settings. Lastly, federal agencies must have internal oversight of their AI use, including appointing a chief AI officer and having AI governance boards in place.

When it comes to generative AI, the policy requires agencies to assess potential benefits while establishing adequate safeguards and oversight mechanisms that allow generative AI to be used in the agency without posing undue risk.

The second requirement is for agencies to be transparent about the AI systems they're using. This includes publishing government-owned AI code, models, and data online, as long as doing so won't harm the public or government operations. If an agency can't disclose specific AI use cases for sensitivity reasons, they must report metrics.

In conclusion, the federal government's AI policy is a step forward in regulating the use of AI while ensuring its benefits are realized without posing a threat to the public. The OMB's safeguards and transparency requirements will help mitigate the risks associated with AI while ensuring that agencies are accountable for their use of AI. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial that the government takes a proactive approach to its regulation and adoption.

As technology continues to evolve, businesses are constantly looking for ways to improve their IT infrastructure. One of the biggest challenges is moving to artificial intelligence (AI), edge systems, and more sustainable architectures. The solution to this challenge is a fresh wave of IT modernization. In this blog post, we will discuss the challenges of moving to new systems and the benefits of hybrid and multicloud clouds.

Body:

Adoption of hybrid and multicloud clouds is expected to double over the next one to three years, according to a new survey of 1,500 IT executives commissioned by Nutanix. The survey shows that CIOs and IT leaders are pressing new platforms and architectures into service as rapidly as possible to support AI, edge systems, security, and sustainability. Nearly four in ten respondents, 37%, say running AI applications on their current IT infrastructure will be a ""significant"" challenge.

IT modernization is a top priority, with IT executives increasing investments in their first-ranked priority for the year, which is AI. The second priority is IT modernization, which means more cloud. AI is propelling this new wave of IT infrastructure modernization, with the goal of also achieving greater data mobility across core cloud and edge environments. Nearly all (99%) respondents say they plan to upgrade their AI applications or infrastructure, with more than half saying they need to improve the transfer of data between cloud, data center, and edge environments to support their AI initiatives.

Industry leaders agree that AI is spurring a range of new investments across the board. Puneet Kohli, president of the application modernization business unit at Rocket Software, says that AI relies on data, and a solid data strategy is needed for AI implementation. Automation can also play a helpful role in data governance and data management. Companies from all industries worldwide continue to increase investments in business process management, workflow, and robotic process automation, and accelerate operational transformations.

Along with AI, edge computing is also taking center stage as a technology investment area in 2024.

Google hints at Apple's RCS support on iPhones this fall[END OF NEW SEO TITLE]","[START OF CLEANED CONTENT]

Google recently highlighted a section on its new Google Messages page that suggests Apple will soon roll out support for Rich Communication Services (RCS) on iPhones. According to a report by 9to5Google, this indicates that the iPhone maker is likely to extend RCS support in the upcoming iOS 18 update.

The page contained information about the benefits of RCS, including a label that read ""coming soon on iOS"" under the subheading ""Better messaging for all."" However, the card is currently not visible on the page. TechCrunch has confirmed that the text related to Apple supporting RCS on iOS is still in the source code of the page.

""Apple has announced it will be adopting RCS in the fall of 2024,"" the description read. ""Once that happens, it will mean a better messaging experience for everyone.""

In November 2021, Apple confirmed that it was working on adding support for RCS. At the time, the company did not specify a timeline, but stated that compatibility would arrive ""next year.""

For years, Google has been urging, nudging, and nagging Apple to add RCS to reduce the ""Green bubble-blue bubble"" differentiation. While RCS won't solve that problem entirely, it will allow Android users to send high-res media to iPhone users via the native text messaging app on Android.

Last year, Google announced new features for RCS, including a profile, Photomoji, and improved audio quality for voice notes. The company stated that 1 billion people were using RCS monthly.

Today's news comes as the U.S. Department of Justice is suing Apple, alleging the Cupertino-based company of monopolistic practices. Notably, the lawsuit counts ""green bubbles"" as an issue affecting user security.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-reversibility-specific-capacity-iron-based.html,"Researchers improve reversibility, specific capacity of iron-based phosphate cathodes for Na-ion batteries","""Improving Reversibility and Energy Density of Iron-Based Phosphate Cathodes in Na-Ion Batteries""","Iron-based phosphate cathodes are known for their low cost and long lifespan, making them a promising choice for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Maricite NaFePO 4 (NFP) is electrochemically inert due to the absence of effective Na+ ion diffusion channels, while Na 2 FeP 2 O 7 has open three-dimensional Na+ channels but low theoretical capacity with air instability. In contrast, Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP-4.0) allows a high theoretical capacity of ~130 mA h g-1 and 3.1 V-level output as well as good air stability. However, the practical reversible capacity of NFPP-4.0 is restricted to the 110 to 120 mA h g-1 range due to structural defects, which is far lower than its theoretical value.

Recently, a research group led by Prof. Zhao Junmei from the Institute of Process Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported an effective strategy to improve the reversible capacity and energy density of iron-based phosphate cathodes through the activation of the inert NFP phase. The study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on March 28.

To increase the theoretical capacity and energy density of iron-based phosphates, the researchers proposed incorporating the maricite NFP phase into the NFPP-4.0 host to create iron-based phosphates with more active Fe2+ contents based on the formation of heterogeneous structure.

The final optimized Na 4.5 Fe 3.5 (PO 4 ) 2.5 (P 2 O 7 ) cathode (i.e., NFPP-4.5; the mole ratio of NFP/NFPP-4.0 is 0.5:1) enables full activation of the inert NFP and delivers a reversible capacity of over 130 mA h g-1, thereby increasing the energy density to 400 W h kg-1, which is close to the highest energy density of iron-based polyanionic cathodes used in NIBs.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that NFPP-4.5 is composed of a bi-phase intergrowth heterogeneous structure based on the NFP and NFPP-4.0 phases, in which the NFP nanodomains are distributed in the continuous NFPP-4.0 matrix, thus generating compatible and percolating interfaces. Such two-phase interfaces can trigger Na+ transportation in the NFP nanodomains, contributing to its electrochemical activation in the composite cathodes.

In situ XRD also confirmed that NFP undergoes amorphization transition upon its first charging and maintains this amorphous nature in following cycles, which is key to achieving the high capacity of NFPP-4.5 with the activation of inert NFP.

The practical application of NFPP-4.5 was validated by the scale-up synthesis of kg-level products and pouch cells, revealing desirable fast-charge capability and superior cycling performance. When charged at 5 C (i.e., five times the battery charging capacity, implying a relatively high charging current), the reversible capacities of the pouch cells still maintained 80% retention compared to 0.1 C (i.e., 0.1 times the battery charging capacity). The pouch cells demonstrated an excellent capacity retention of more than 88% after cycling at 3 C (i.e., three times the battery charging capacity) 2,000 times, demonstrating huge application prospects.

In conclusion, this work provides guidance on developing low-cost, high-performance polyanion cathodes that can be used in Na-ion batteries.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/researchers-improve-re.jpg,2024-03-29 09:32:14,Boost your Na-ion battery performance with activated iron-based phosphate cathodes.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/bumbles-new-ceo-talks-about-her-critical-mission-to-spice-things-up-at-the-company/,Bumble's new CEO talks about her critical mission: to spice things up at the company, Bumble's New CEO Takes on Turnaround Mission: Restore Joy to Dating ,"Tis the Season for Turnaround CEOs

Bumble’s IPO in February 2021 marked a significant milestone in the dating industry. However, since then, investors have become less enthusiastic about the company’s prospects. Bumble’s share price has fallen from $76 to approximately $11 per share, and the company faces the challenge of user fatigue. Younger people are increasingly turning to other platforms to find love, such as TikTok, Snapchat, and even Discord. Now, it falls to Lidiane Jones, Bumble’s new CEO, to reverse these trends.

Jones was previously a turnaround CEO at Slack but left after just 10 months. She has a mission to rejuvenate Bumble and has a comprehensive plan in place. Jones believes that the key to success is restoring joy to the dating experience, which has become increasingly unenjoyable for many users. She also emphasizes the importance of AI in improving the app’s functionality and enhancing user safety.

Bumble’s upcoming relaunch of its app in the second quarter of this year is a crucial step in the company’s turnaround strategy. Jones is reconsidering the idea of women making the first move, which she believes is a significant shift. She wants to empower women to have more control and flexibility in their dating experiences, giving them the freedom to decide who makes the first move.

In addition to enhancing user experiences, Jones is also focusing on security and AI. She believes that the app’s technology must be safe and secure to ensure users’ privacy and trust. Bumble’s AI models will be refined to reflect its values and safety guidelines, and the company is exploring the use of criminal background checks to enhance user safety.

Overall, Jones’ plan is to revitalize Bumble by restoring joy to the dating experience, improving user safety, and leveraging AI to enhance the app’s functionality. The outcome is uncertain, but if successful, Jones’ efforts could turn Bumble around and restore investors’ confidence in the company.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lidiane-Jones-Bumble-Sweatshirt-3-credit-Kristen-Kilpatrick.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 00:26:10,"Revive Bumble's dating experience with new CEO Lidiane Jones' plan to enhance user joy, safety, and app functionality through AI.

This recognition honors Hassabis's contributions to the field, which have been instrumental in positioning the U.K. as a leading player in the global AI revolution.

Hassabis, born in London in 1976, emerged as a prodigy in a variety of disciplines and reached master status at chess as a teenager. He went on to work in various AI and computer science roles before earning a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from University College London. In 2010, he founded DeepMind along with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, and the company has since become one of the U.K.'s greatest AI exports.

The U.K. has been eager to position itself at the forefront of the AI revolution, driven by initiatives such as the AI Safety Summit, which it hosted in England last November. The country sits among the top-tier AI countries globally in terms of R&D investment, behind the U.S. and China. Demis Hassabis has been a critical figure in this effort, and his knighthood recognizes his contributions to the field.

In recent years, Hassabis has led DeepMind to develop an AI system that beat the world champion of strategy board game Go, among other achievements. However, the company has also courted controversy, such as when it signed data-sharing deals with the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS). Nevertheless, Hassabis's knighthood is a testament to the importance of his work in the field of AI.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-qa-ai-dont.html,Q&A: How to train AI when you don't have enough data," ""How to Train AI with Limited Data: UW Researchers Use Baby Monitor to Monitor Baby's Pose"" ","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that excels at analyzing large amounts of data and detecting patterns or trends. However, these machine learning algorithms require extensive training before they can accurately identify patterns and make predictions.

One challenge faced by researchers in the field of AI is the lack of data to train algorithms for certain applications. For example, analyzing X-ray image data to detect rare conditions or identifying a rare fish species caught on a commercial fishing boat can be difficult due to the limited availability of data.

Jenq-Neng Hwang, a professor at the University of Washington, specializes in developing algorithms to address these issues. One of his team's recent projects involved teaching AI to monitor a baby's distinct poses throughout the day. The team developed a pipeline to create a unique algorithm that accurately and reliably identified a baby's 3D pose from annotated video sequences.

The team presented their work at the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2024 and their research is available on the arXiv preprint server. Hwang spoke with UW News about the project details and other similar challenges his team is addressing.

One of the main benefits of using AI for this task is the ability to continuously and consistently track a baby's poses throughout the day using a baby monitor. This information can be used to identify potential health issues and help families with a history of autism determine if their babies are also at risk.

While AI is a good fit for this task, there are challenges related to the lack of data available to train the algorithms. In this case, the team developed a pipeline that combined a generic 3D pose generative AI model with their limited dataset of annotated baby motion sequences. This allowed the AI model to adapt to the small dataset and produce high-quality results.

There are many other scenarios where there is not enough data to train AI algorithms. For example, analyzing rare conditions in medical images or identifying unknown species in the wild can be challenging due to the limited availability of data.

The company’s board is weighing an offer of renounced shares, which were recently rejected by some investors in protest, to prevent the dilution of the investors' holdings ahead of validating a recent rights issue.

At stake is the future of Byju’s, once the most valuable startup in India and the face of the local ecosystem. The dispute between the Bengaluru-based startup and its investors stems from a rights issue that the startup initiated in late January, following a year-long struggle to raise funds. Rights issues allow companies to raise capital by giving shareholders the opportunity to purchase additional shares at a discount, in proportion to their current stake. By not participating in the rights issue, the investors risk getting their holdings in Byju's diluted down to almost nothing.

Investors Prosus, Peak XV, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative didn't participate in the rights issue, and are currently in a legal battle to remove Raveendran from the firm and invalidate the $200 million it raised through the rights issue. The investors reached an Indian company court earlier this year that ordered Byju’s to move the $200 million to an escrow account until the matters are resolved.

In an email to shareholders on Friday morning, Raveendran announced the startup’s board’s consideration of making the offer to disgruntled investors, despite the “animosity” they have displayed and their “uncalled for legal actions.” Raveendran also informed the shareholders that the startup has already received over 50% of the votes required to increase the authorized share capital in the startup to bring into effect the fully-subscribed $200 million rights issue. Byju’s held an extraordinary general meeting on Friday, where it attempted to pass the resolution over the rights issue. The result of the rights issue won't emerge until April 6, and the two parties are set to appear before the Indian company court again on April 4.

Byju’s is running against time even though it has slashed costs in recent quarters. Byju's needs the capital raised from the rights issue to sustain its business operations. Resolving the ongoing dispute with its investors is also crucial for the company to initiate future fundraising efforts and maintain its financial stability.

Raveendran has always been committed to building a company with a spirit of equality and equity, regardless of shareholding size. In his email, he reiterated his conviction that they would overcome their challenges together, despite the difficult time they are facing.

The Evolution of Adult Content Moderation on Social Media Platforms

In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, platforms are continually adapting to the diverse content shared by their users. Recently, a significant development has emerged concerning the management of adult content on a platform widely recognized as a microblogging giant.

A New Dawn for NSFW Content

The platform, which has undergone a rebranding, has introduced a pivotal change in its approach to Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. Community administrators now have the autonomy to mark their groups with an ""Adult Content"" label. This initiative is a departure from the previous blanket filtering system, aiming to provide a more nuanced content experience.

The Impact of NSFW Content

NSFW material has long been a part of the platform's ecosystem, serving as a prominent advertising medium for various adult-oriented services and creators. Historical data suggests that a significant portion of the platform's posts fell under this category, highlighting its prevalence and growth even amidst the decline of other content genres.

Technological and Policy Enhancements

The platform's commitment to refining user experience is evident in its latest updates. Administrators are empowered with new tools to categorize content effectively, and a suite of moderation features is set to streamline community management. These include sorting capabilities, enhanced reporting mechanisms, and the introduction of a Ban button to combat spam and maintain community standards.

Future Prospects and Community Growth

Looking ahead, the platform is poised to enhance community engagement through improved discovery tools and analytics. The promotion of communities on prominent tabs promises to bolster visibility and growth, while upcoming interface updates anticipate an enriched user interaction.

Conclusion

As social media platforms navigate the complexities of content moderation, the integration of clear policies and advanced tools is crucial. The recent changes mark a significant step towards a more inclusive and controlled environment, where adult content can coexist with other forms of expression within the bounds of community guidelines.

In today's world, where AI is becoming increasingly prevalent and the internet is more vulnerable to manipulation, the need for data transparency and verifiability is more important than ever. Space and Time, a web3 startup, believes it can help solve this problem with its verifiable computing layer for web3.

On TechCrunch's Chain Reaction podcast, Space and Time's CTO and co-founder, Scott Dykstra, discussed the importance of data transparency and the need to ensure that data and brands are verifiable. Dykstra gave the example of the FTX collapse, where the now-defunct crypto exchange was manipulating its books internally and misleading investors. This manipulation was similar to making a query to a database for financial records but manipulating it inside their own database.

Dykstra sees this as a problem that transcends beyond the crypto industry and into other industries. There is an incentive for financial institutions to want to manipulate their records, and this becomes more problematic. ZK proofs, which are cryptographic actions used to prove something about a piece of information without revealing the origin data itself, can be used to verify and retrieve the data.

Space and Time aims to be the verifiable computing layer for web3 by indexing data both off-chain and on-chain. However, Dykstra sees it expanding beyond the industry and into others. The startup has indexed from major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, Sui, Avalanche, Sei, and Aptos and is adding support for more chains to power the future of AI and blockchain technology.

One of Dykstra's recent concerns is that AI data isn't really verifiable. He is worried that we will never be able to efficiently verify that an LLM was executed correctly. There are teams today that are working on solving this issue by building ZK proofs for machine learning or large language models, but it can take years to try and create that. This means that the model operator can tamper with the system or LLM to do things that are problematic.

Dykstra believes that there needs to be a ""decentralized, but globally, always available database"" that can be created through blockchains. Everyone needs to access it, and it can't be a monopoly. For example, in a hypothetical scenario, OpenAI itself can't be the proprietor of a database of a journal for which journalists are creating content. Instead, it has to be something that's owned by the community and operated by the community in a way that's readily available and uncensorable.

In conclusion, Space and Time's verifiable computing layer for web3 can help ensure data transparency and verifiability in the rapidly evolving world of AI and blockchain technology. With ZK proofs and a decentralized database, we can prevent bad actors from manipulating data and ensure that data is trustworthy and reliable.

Social Media: The Double-Edged Sword

In the digital age, social networks have become an integral part of our lives. Whether it's Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok, we spend hours scrolling through our feeds and engaging with others. But have you ever wondered what it would be like to post anything and get likes without the constant pressure of maintaining a perfect online persona? That's where Palmsy comes in.

Palmsy is a new app that allows you to post anything you want and get likes without the need for anyone else to see your posts. Developed by Pat Nakajima, Palmsy is designed to help users break their social media addiction and rediscover the joy of writing without the fear of judgment.

How does it work? Palmsy reads your contact list and assigns fake likes to your posts. While the app is reading your contact details, all posts remain local, meaning they are not sent to a server. You can publish as many posts as you like, and the app even allows you to add photos to your posts. The catch is that no one will see your posts, not even your friends or followers.

But don't worry, Nakajima assures us that the app is not a substitute for real-life social interaction. It's meant to be a tool to help users focus on their writing and creativity without the distractions of social media. The app even has advanced options that let you limit the number of likes on a particular post and for how long you want those likes to come in: a few seconds, a few minutes, a few hours, or a few days.

Palmsy is not the only app that aims to help users reduce their social media addiction. There have been multiple time-limiting apps that try to help when it comes to reducing social media addiction. Some developers have also released very basic apps to post dumb posts without consequences. However, Palmsy stands out because it provides a unique solution to the problem of online identity and the pressure to maintain a perfect online persona.

In conclusion, Palmsy is an interesting app that provides a unique solution to the problem of social media addiction. While it may not be for everyone, it's worth considering if you're looking for a way to rediscover the joy of writing without the constant pressure of social media. So why not give it a try and see how it can help you break free from the cycle of likes and comments?

The gig economy has become increasingly popular in recent years, with companies like Uber and Lyft taking advantage of the trend. While these companies claim to offer flexibility and independence to their drivers, they have been criticized for their labor practices and the impact they have had on traditional industries such as the taxi industry.

Uber's business model has been controversial from the beginning. The company has been accused of railroading into new markets without getting approval from regulators and has been involved in several scandals over the years. In addition, Uber has been criticized for its treatment of its drivers, who are often classified as contractors rather than employees.

One of the casualties of the ride-sharing boom has been taxi medallions. For decades, cab drivers in many locales saw these licenses as retirement plans, but in recent years, the value of medallions has plummeted. In New York, for example, the value of a medallion dropped from around $1 million in 2014 to $100,000 in 2021.

Some jurisdictions have tried to offset the collapse in medallion value. Quebec pledged $250 million CAD in 2018 to compensate cab drivers, while other regulators have applied a per-ride fee to ride-sharing services to replace taxi licenses and compensate medallion holders. However, these efforts have not been enough to offset the impact on medallion holders, and many rideshare drivers have also suffered financially.

In 2017, Uber settled allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it used false promises about potential earnings to entice drivers to join its platform. Late last year, the company and Lyft agreed to pay $328 million to New York drivers after the state conducted a wage theft investigation. The settlement also guaranteed a minimum hourly rate for drivers outside of New York City.

Many rideshare drivers have also sought recognition as employees rather than contractors, so they can have a consistent hourly wage, overtime pay, and benefits. The Department of Labor recently issued a final rule that aims to make it more difficult for gig economy companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The EU is also weighing a provisional deal to reclassify millions of app workers as employees.

In the early days, Uber's CEO, Travis Kalanick, had grand plans for the company's future. He envisioned a world without drivers, where Uber would operate a fleet of self-driving vehicles and flying taxis. However, these plans have not come to fruition, and the company continues to face challenges in the face of ongoing legal battles and changing public attitudes towards the gig economy.

In conclusion, the gig economy has had a significant impact on traditional industries and the lives of many workers. While companies like Uber and Lyft have offered some flexibility and independence to their drivers, they have also been criticized for their labor practices and the impact they have had on the economy. As the gig economy continues to evolve, it will be important to consider the potential consequences of these changes and work towards creating a fair and equitable labor market for all workers.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1_Kh9h_P4emCAe45VfYL_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/70ebe730-e083-11ee-adb4-2a4cdea0f515,2024-03-29 16:45:28,"The gig economy, popularized by companies like Uber, has both benefits and challenges.

Introduction

Grok is a cutting-edge chatbot developed by xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup. Understanding how Grok works and what it can do can help you make the most of this tool. In this article, we'll explore the basics of Grok, its capabilities, and limitations.

How Does Grok Work?

Grok is powered by a generative AI model called Grok-1, which was developed over several months on a cluster of ""tens of thousands"" of GPUs (according to an xAI blog post). To train it, xAI sourced data from the web and from feedback from human assistants referred to as ""AI tutors.""

On popular benchmarks, Grok-1 is as capable as Meta's open source Llama 2 chatbot model and surpasses OpenAI's GPT-3.5, xAI claims. Grok's ability to access real-time X data is one of its key selling points, as no other chatbots have this capability, thanks to X's decision to gatekeep that data.

When asked about a topic, Grok will provide an answer based on its knowledge base. If the topic falls beyond its knowledge base, Grok will leverage ""real-time access"" to information on X and the internet, enabling it to provide up-to-date information about the topic.

Human-guided feedback, or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), is the way most AI-powered chatbots are fine-tuned these days. RLHF involves training a generative model, then gathering additional information to train a ""reward"" model and fine-tuning the generative model with the reward model via reinforcement learning.

Introduction

Get ready, podcast enthusiasts! Google has announced that it's pulling the plug on its Podcasts app in the United States. As of April 2, 2024, users must transfer their subscriptions to YouTube Music to continue following and enjoying their preferred programs. Failure to do so will result in losing access to stream podcasts via the Google Podcasts app post-April 2. In this article, we delve deeper into what led to this decision, how it might impact podcast consumers, and potential alternatives moving forward.

Rationale Behind Discontinuing Google Podcasts

Launched over half a decade ago, the Google Podcasts app quickly became popular among Android device owners due to its straightforward design, facilitating easy discovery, subscription management, and playback of various podcast series. Additionally, users appreciated the option to manually input podcast URLs using RSS feeds. Regrettably, Google declared in late 2023 its intentions to phase out the Podcasts app gradually throughout 2024 as part of a larger initiative to consolidate its audio services under the YouTube umbrella.

A Transition Strategy Similar to Google Play Music

This isn't Google's first rodeo when it comes to shifting users to different platforms. Back in 2020, YouTube Music provided a comparable approach to guide music lovers away from Google Play Music before its eventual sunset later that same year. While the Google Podcasts app remained functional during this period, it was primarily attributed to YouTube Music being ill-prepared to accommodate podcasts fully—that is, until the end of 2023. At this point, YouTube Music began supporting global podcast consumption. Moreover, the platform introduced RSS feed integration just a couple of months ago, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive audio solution encompassing both music and podcasts alike.

Why Consolidating Under YouTube May Benefit Google

Transferring podcast operations to YouTube makes strategic sense for several reasons. Firstly, merging resources can potentially strengthen Google's presence in the burgeoning podcast market. Secondly, there seems to be growing demand for visual podcast experiences—something YouTube excels at offering. Recently, Spotify formed partnerships with Universal Music Group to introduce video podcasts to American audiences, closely mirroring YouTube's existing capabilities. With these factors in mind, integrating Google Podcasts into YouTube may prove advantageous for Google in terms of increased competitiveness and user engagement.

How Will Affected Users Adapt?

As Google Podcasts app usage ceases domestically, affected users face two primary options: either embracing YouTube Music or exploring third-party alternatives compatible with their needs. Fortunately, numerous high-quality podcast applications cater to diverse preferences and requirements, ensuring users won't experience significant difficulties finding worthy replacements.

Conclusion

Although saying goodbye to the familiar Google Podcasts app might feel bittersweet initially, podcast aficionados can take solace in knowing viable alternatives exist. Whether opting for YouTube Music or seeking refuge elsewhere, users can maintain seamless access to their cherished programs without missing much of a beat. Ultimately, such transitions underscore the ever-evolving nature of technology and digital entertainment landscapes; adaptation remains key to staying connected amidst ongoing changes.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1079623010.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 19:49:49,"""Discover your favorite podcasts without missing a beat!

https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-has-reportedly-been-blocked-on-all-congress-owned-devices-034946166.html,Microsoft Copilot has reportedly been blocked on all Congress-owned devices, Microsoft Copilot blocked on Congress-owned devices due to security concerns. ,"The US Congress has recently prohibited the use of Microsoft's Copilot on government-issued devices, citing security concerns. The AI chatbot, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models, was deemed a risk due to the potential for leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services. While staffers can still use Copilot on their own personal devices, it will be officially blocked on all Windows-based devices owned by the Congress.

This move is not new, as the Congress had already set strict limits on the use of ChatGPT, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models, a year ago. Staffers were allowed to use the paid (ChatGPT Plus) version of the chatbot for research and evaluation, but the free version was banned from use on House computers.

Recently, the White House issued rules for federal agencies to follow when it comes to the use of generative AI. These rules ensure that any tool used by the government does not endanger the rights and safety of Americans. Microsoft has acknowledged the need for higher security requirements for government users and has announced a roadmap of tools and services designed for government use. These include an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant.

Szpindor's office will evaluate the government version of Copilot when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices. While this move may be inconvenient for staffers, it is crucial for maintaining the security of government data.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"Microsoft Copilot has been banned on government-issued devices due to security concerns, as it was deemed a risk for leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/orbit-fab-unveils-30k-port-to-refuel-satellites/,Orbit Fab unveils $30K port to refuel satellites, Revolutionize Satellite Industry with $30K Ports | Orbit Fab ,"Orbit Fab, a Colorado-based startup, is revolutionizing the satellite industry by building ""gas stations"" for satellites. The company has developed a docking mechanism, called RAFTI, that allows spacecraft to transfer propellant from an orbital tanker to the customer's spacecraft. The price tag for each port is just $30,000.

The idea behind RAFTI is to provide a solution for spacecraft that are optimized with the amount of fuel they have and eventually run out. The extra kilogram of propellant that can be added can generate as much as $1 million in marginal revenue. This is a significant opportunity for the space industry, and Orbit Fab is positioned to capitalize on it.

The company was founded in 2018 and has since raised $6 million in seed funding and $28.5 million in Series A funding. The CEO and co-founder, Daniel Faber, has been working in the space industry for decades and has a wealth of experience in satellite thrusters and asteroid mining.

Orbit Fab's technology is ambitious, but the architecture is relatively simple. The company sells fuel and fueling ports, and the real money will come from the fuel sales. The hydrazine delivery service in geostationary orbit will cost $20 million for up to 100 kilograms.

However, nailing each part of the hardware is critical, and it has taken years for Orbit Fab to debut the refueling port. There are many variables to consider, including the cost to the customer, the potential marginal revenue from extra life on orbit, the impact of fueling on the customer spacecraft, and the challenge of developing a docking mechanism that can also transfer propellant.

To ensure its component complied with standards from NASA, the Space Force, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the company had to go through a rigorous process. The RAFTI had to be safe, reliable, and able to withstand the harsh environment of space.

One of the biggest shifts from when the company started to now is the standing up of the U.S. Space Force and its effects on the space industry. Orbit Fab ended up pivoting much of its attention to addressing the nascent needs of the Space Force, which was very interested in orbital mobility to avoid space debris","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An-Orbit-Fab-fuel-shuttle-is-docking-with-an-on-orbit-satellite-equipped-with-a-RAFTI-refueling-port.jpg?resize=1200,817",2024-03-29 18:34:11,"Meta Description:

The Plantee team has created an impressive pitch deck that ticks almost all the boxes, earning a 97.7% chance of success according to a pitch deck analysis tool. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

Three things to love about Plantee's pitch deck:

1. The opening slides provide a clear introduction to the company and its goals.
2. The product is focused on making plant care easier and more effective, addressing a gap in the market.
3. The competitive landscape slide is comprehensive and highlights the lack of competition in the space.

3. The ask slide lacks clarity on how the funds raised will be used.

In conclusion, Plantee's pitch deck is impressive and has a strong chance of success. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to clarify the product's unique selling point and how the company plans to make money.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pitch-Deck-Teardown-Plantee.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-29 16:00:37,"Meta Description: Discover Plantee's impressive pitch deck, earning a 97.7% chance of success.
