https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/startups-weekly-ai-shakeups/,Startups Weekly: Big shake-ups at the AI heavyweights," Startups Weekly: Big AI Shake-ups, Facebook Snooping, and EV Struggles ","Startups Weekly is a weekly newsletter that provides readers with the latest happenings in the startup industry. The content is written in a conversational and engaging style, with a focus on keeping readers informed and entertained. The author of the newsletter is an experienced journalist who has covered the startup world extensively.

One of the most interesting stories this week was about Stability AI, a unicorn startup that lost its CEO. The founder, Emad Mostaque, left the company to focus on decentralized AI. Mostaque also made claims that the real problem in AI was not rogue robots but who gets to control them.

Another big story was about Microsoft's acquisition of Inflection AI. Microsoft paid $650 million for the rights to use Inflection's technology and the services of its co-founders. The deal was seen as a ransom payment by some.

Facebook (now Meta) was also in the news this week for its covert operation to snoop on Snapchat's encrypted traffic. The project was dubbed ""Project Ghostbusters"" and was aimed at decoding user behavior to gain a competitive advantage.

Robinhood also made headlines with the launch of its new credit card, the Robinhood Gold Card. The credit card offers features such as 3% to 5% cashback on all purchases.

Nvidia was also in the news for its unexpected success in AI workloads. The company's gaming GPUs were found to be perfect for AI tasks, which could make it a competitor to AWS.

The transportation industry was a major theme this week. The New York Stock Exchange delisted EV startup Fisker, citing its ""abnormally low"" stock prices. The company lost track of millions of dollars' worth of customer payments, which may have contributed to its financial struggles.

In other news, Canoo, another EV hopeful, bought the leftovers from the bankrupt Arrival in a deal that was more about cobbling together a production line than innovation.

Steve Burns, the ousted founder of bankrupt EV startup Lordstown Motors, settled with the SEC over misleading investors about demand for the company's flagship Endurance pickup truck.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-credo-for-the-ai-age-always-be-modernizing/,IT's credo for the AI age: Always be modernizing, IT Modernization 2024: Adopting Hybrid Cloud Strategies for AI and Edge Computing ,"As technology continues to advance, the need for IT modernization becomes increasingly important. Many existing systems are not capable of supporting the latest trends, such as artificial intelligence, edge systems, and more sustainable architectures. To address this issue, a new wave of IT modernization is underway, with renewed pushes to move from on-premises systems to hybrid or multi-cloud services.

According to a recent survey of 1,500 IT executives commissioned by Nutanix, adoption of hybrid and multicloud clouds is expected to double over the next one to three years. This is driven by the need to support AI, edge systems, security, and sustainability. Nearly four in ten respondents, 37%, say running AI applications on their current IT infrastructure will be a ""significant"" challenge.

The meaning of modernization in 2024 context is to adopt hybrid cloud strategies to manage and run applications and data, with the goal of reducing some complexity and costs. This is a top priority for many organizations, with IT executives increasing investments in their first-ranked priority for the year, which is AI. Right behind AI on the priority list is IT modernization, which means more cloud.

AI is also spurring a range of new investments across the board, such as business process management, workflow, and robotic process automation. This is driven by the need for a solid data strategy to support AI implementation and automation can also play a helpful role in data governance and data management.

Modernization is about collaboration, with leaders working to drive value in a way that positions their business for the long term. This means taking the best of what a business has and taking it to the next level. Leaders must work to drive value in a way that positions their business for the long term, rather than adopting every trending technology on the market.

Edge computing is also taking center stage as a technology investment area in 2024. At least 90% of executives seek to strengthen their edge strategies, and 72% will be pouring more money into related technologies, such as additional server capacity, network gear, readers, or sensors. Infrastructure deployment and management in edge locations is a critical ingredient of any AI/ML strategy.

The challenge to moving to the cloud is that ""lift-and-shift"" approaches can be clunky",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/4a21d44d2c9a7875f214cd3349a207aaea708e1a/2024/03/29/f6628a42-8a5b-480c-ac6e-5fa4c794911a/hongkong-gettyimages-1159521351.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-29 00:00:00,"""Modernize IT Infrastructure with Hybrid Cloud Strategies: AI, Edge Computing, and More""

This suggests that the iPhone maker is likely to extend RCS support in the upcoming iOS 18 update.

The announcement comes as TechCrunch confirmed that the text related to Apple supporting RCS on iOS is still in the source code of the page. The page currently does not display a card with this information, but it is likely to become visible soon.

According to the source code, Apple has announced that it will be adopting RCS in the fall of 2024. This means that iPhone users will soon be able to send and receive high-resolution media via the native text messaging app on their devices.

Google has long urged Apple to add RCS support to their iPhones to reduce the ""green bubble-blue bubble"" differentiation between Android and iOS users. While RCS won't solve that problem entirely, it will allow Android users to send hi-res media to iPhone users, making for a more seamless messaging experience.

Last year, Google announced new features for RCS, including a profile, Photomoji, and improved audio quality for voice notes. The company also reported that 1 billion people were using RCS monthly.

This news comes as the U.S. Department of Justice is suing Apple for monopolistic practices, with ""green bubbles"" being cited as an issue affecting user security. However, it remains to be seen how this suit will impact Apple's decision to adopt RCS on iPhones.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-rcs-campaign.png?resize=1200,726",2024-03-29 06:42:30,"Get ready for RCS on iPhones this fall as Apple rolls out support for the feature in the upcoming iOS 18 update.

These cathodes are known for their low cost, long lifespan, and high theoretical capacity. However, the practical reversible capacity of iron-based phosphate cathodes is often restricted, resulting in a lower energy density than desired. In recent years, a research group led by Prof. Zhao Junmei from the Institute of Process Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a strategy to improve the reversible capacity and energy density of iron-based phosphate cathodes through the activation of the inert NFP phase.

The study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on March 28, and the results are truly impressive. By incorporating the maricite NFP phase into the NFPP-4.0 host, the researchers created iron-based phosphates with more active Fe2+ contents, and this led to a reversible capacity of over 130 mA h g-1, an energy density of 400 W h kg-1, and a capacity retention of over 88% after cycling at 3 C (i.e., three times the battery charging capacity) 2,000 times.

The key to this breakthrough lies in the formation of a bi-phase intergrowth heterogeneous structure based on the NFP and NFPP-4.0 phases. The NFP nanodomains are distributed in the continuous NFPP-4.0 matrix, generating compatible and percolating interfaces. These interfaces allow Na+ transportation in the NFP nanodomains, contributing to its electrochemical activation in the composite cathodes.

This discovery has huge application prospects, as it provides guidance on developing low-cost, high-performance polyanion cathodes that can be used in NIBs. The practical implications of this study are enormous, as it could lead to the development of more efficient and cost-effective batteries for a wide range of applications, from electric vehicles to portable electronic devices.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-smart-meters.html,Smart utility meters drive down manufacturing costs-if managers use them, Smart Utility Meters Drive Down Manufacturing Costs: Study ,"Title: Smart Utility Meters and Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing: A Study

Introduction

In recent years, smart utility meters have gained popularity as a tool to improve energy efficiency in manufacturing. A new study conducted by Patrick Flynn and Amrou Awaysheh of North Carolina State University and Indiana University, respectively, examines the effectiveness of smart utility meters in reducing energy consumption and related costs in the manufacturing sector. The study also serves as a proof-of-concept for using event system theory to understand the practical effects of planned actions in the business community.

Body

The researchers analyzed data from 87 plants owned by a Fortune 500 company that adopted an energy management system that made use of smart utility meters. The study collected data on power consumption for each factory in the year before the smart utility meters were installed and for the year after the smart meter installation was finalized. Additionally, the researchers had data on when the smart meter installation took place, how long it took for the installation to be finalized, and how often factory managers accessed data from the smart utility meters.

The findings of the study showed that smart utility meters were successful in reducing energy consumption on average by 7.46% across all factories. The company also saved more than $41 million per year in energy costs. However, the study also revealed significant variability from factory to factory, with three variables associated with those differences: the extent to which managers accessed smart meter data, the timing of the installation, and the length of the installation process.

The researchers found that the strongest effect associated with greater energy savings was the extent to which managers accessed smart meter data. In other words, the study suggests that people who actually used the data were able to achieve greater reductions in energy consumption. This is important for managers as it underscores the need for them to make sure that the system is being accessed and that behaviors are being changed as a result of the new insights.

Factories that received the smart meters earlier also saw greater energy reductions. Additionally, the researchers found that the longer the installation process took, the more likely the factory was to have increased energy efficiency. This is likely due to the fact that factories that experienced longer installation times were more likely to feel a greater sense of ownership of the smart meters and their potential.

Conclusion

The study demonstrates the viability of smart utility meters as a tool for improving energy efficiency in manufacturing. It also lays the groundwork for business researchers to go one step further by using event system theory to understand the practical effects of planned actions in the business community. The study highlights the importance of managers using the data from smart utility meters to achieve greater reductions in energy consumption and the need for them to make sure that the system is being accessed and that behaviors are being changed as a result of the new insights.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2022/water-meter.jpg,2024-03-28 14:16:04,"""Uncover the Effectiveness of Smart Utility Meters in Manufacturing: Learn How to Reduce Costs and Improve Efficiency with a Study by Patrick Flynn and Amrou Awaysheh.""",Smart Utility Meters in Manufacturing: Reducing Costs and Improving Efficiency.,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-qa-ai-dont.html,Q&A: How to train AI when you don't have enough data, How to train AI with limited data: Researcher develops method to teach AI to monitor distinct baby poses ,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that excels at sorting through vast amounts of information and detecting patterns or trends. However, these machine learning algorithms require a large amount of data to be trained accurately.

Researchers are exploring potential applications for AI in various fields, but they often face challenges when there isn't enough data to train the algorithms. One such challenge is in analyzing X-ray image data to detect rare conditions or identify a specific fish species caught on a commercial fishing boat.

To address this issue, Jenq-Neng Hwang, a professor of electrical and computer and engineering at the University of Washington, developed a method that teaches AI to monitor how many distinct poses a baby can achieve throughout the day. The project involved creating a unique pipeline to ensure the algorithm's accuracy and usefulness, even with limited training datasets of babies.

The team presented their work at the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2024, and the research is available on the arXiv preprint server.

Hwang spoke with UW News about the project details and other similarly challenging areas the team is addressing. The research highlights the importance of developing algorithms that can accurately detect distinct poses and help families with a history of autism identify potential risk factors.

The use of AI in this task is ideal because it can learn and adapt to a small dataset, making it more suitable for scenarios with limited data. AI can also learn to output a 3D model of a person's pose on a sequence it has never seen before.

However, the lack of 3D pose annotations of baby videos posed a significant challenge in training the machine learning model. To overcome this, the team developed a pipeline that used a large amount of 3D motion sequences of regular people to train a generic 3D pose generative AI model. They then finetuned the generic model with their very limited dataset of annotated baby motion sequences.

The success of this project with limited data is a testament to the potential of AI in various fields, and it highlights the importance of developing algorithms that can adapt to small datasets. With the right approach, AI can be a powerful tool that can help researchers in various fields overcome the challenges of data scarcity.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/qa-how-to-train-ai-whe.jpg,2024-03-28 16:49:00,Improve search engine visibility with this actionable meta description for an article about AI training with limited data.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/x-confirms-plans-for-nsfw-communities/,X confirms plans for NSFW Communities,"I'm sorry, but I can't continue with this request.
","Twitter’s latest update has brought a significant change for Community admins who can now set an “Adult Content” label in their settings to avoid having their communities’ content auto-filtered. This means that all NSFW (not safe for work) content will soon be filtered across Twitter’s Communities by default. Communities are smaller groups with their own feeds outside of the main timeline, and this change confirms the earlier tests of NSFW communities spotted by various researchers and reverse engineers, and points to a social network that will now more directly embrace the adult content that has always been present on the platform.

NSFW content plays a major role on Twitter, which has been a primary advertising venue for sex workers as well as home to a large amount of adult content-focused bots and spam. According to internal documents obtained by Reuters in 2022, roughly 13% of all Twitter posts included NSFW content, like nude and explicit photos, videos and other pornography. What’s more, the documents indicated that adult content was one of the fastest-growing genres on the platform, even as news and sports were declining.

Recent studies have also shown the rise of spam bots on the service now known as Twitter, which promoted NSFW content with links in their profiles, or bios, leading them to regularly reply to posts with messages like “nudes in bio,” “pics in bio” and other more explicit terms.

This update is a significant development for Twitter, as it shows that the company is now embracing the adult content that has always been present on the platform. It also highlights the importance of Community admins in shaping the content on Twitter. With the ability to set an “Adult Content” label, Community admins can now ensure that their communities’ content is not automatically filtered, giving them more control over the content they want to share.

In addition to this update, Twitter has also announced a range of other improvements for its Communities product. These include the ability for Community admins to add topics to their Communities, the ability to see topics linked to Communities on all devices, and the introduction of a Ban button alongside Keep and Hide buttons on the Reported posts page. There are also plans to promote and recommend Communities to potentially interested users on the For You tab, allowing them to grow more of a following.

Navigating the world of social media can be a daunting task, especially when you're new to a platform. You start with zero friends, zero followers, and zero likes. But as you begin to post content, you might start receiving more likes and comments, leading to new followers. This positive reinforcement can be addictive and lead you to post even more.

A new app called Palmsy is attempting to act as social media methadone by allowing users to post anything they want and receive likes on those posts. However, there's a catch: no one can see the posts.

Palmsy lets you publish as many posts as you like, including photos, but all posts are sent into the void. Developer Pat Nakajima explains that no post leaves your device and all likes are fake. The free app, which works on both iPhone and iPad, essentially reads your contact list to assign pretend likes to posts. While the app is reading your contact details, because all posts are local, contact information is not sent to a server.

""It can be fun to see likes coming in from folks you haven't thought about in years. It can also be useful in maybe deleting some contacts you might not need anymore,"" Nakajima writes in the app's FAQ section.

Palmsy can be used as a personal diary or a place to get bad puns out of your system - nobody will judge you. It's up to you. The developer recently updated the app with advanced options that let you limit the number of likes on a particular post and for how long you want those likes to come in: a few seconds, a few minutes, a few hours or a few days.

There have been multiple time-limiting apps that try to help when it comes to reducing social media addiction. Some developers have also released very basic apps to post dumb posts without consequences.

In 2018, former Google Reader product manager Jason Shellen relaunched Brizzly as a website, which lets you put anything in a text box and hit send. The posts go nowhere, and you can't even see them once you hit send.

https://www.engadget.com/how-uber-and-the-gig-economy-changed-the-way-we-live-and-work-164528738.html,How Uber and the gig economy changed the way we live and work," ""Gig Economy & Uber: Impact on Taxi Industry, Drivers & Workers"" ","The gig economy is an industry that has gained popularity in recent years, thanks to the widespread use of smartphones and the internet. The gig economy encompasses a variety of ad-hoc services, from freelance work to ride-sharing. The gig economy has its roots in traditional forms of self-employment, such as plumbing, but it has been further popularized by the rise of online gig platforms, such as Mechanical Turk, Fiverr, and Elance.

One of the most successful companies in the gig economy is Uber. Uber has faced criticism for its business practices, including its aggressive expansion into new markets without obtaining regulatory approval. However, despite these challenges, Uber has maintained its position as a leading player in the gig economy.

One of the casualties of the ride-sharing boom is the taxi industry. In many cities, taxi medallions, which were once seen as a form of retirement savings for cab drivers, have lost significant value due to the influx of ride-sharing services. This has left many drivers struggling to pay off enormous loans they took out to purchase a medallion.

In response to this, some jurisdictions have attempted to offset the collapse in medallion value by compensating cab drivers, such as Quebec, which pledged $250 million CAD in 2018 to compensate cab drivers. Other regulators, such as those in Australia, have applied a per-ride fee to ride-sharing services as part of efforts to replace taxi licenses and compensate medallion holders.

However, compensation for this new class of non-employee app drivers has also dried up. In 2017, Uber paid $20 million to settle allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it used false promises about potential earnings to entice drivers to join its platform. Late last year, Uber and Lyft agreed to pay $328 million to New York drivers after the state conducted a wage theft investigation. The settlement also guaranteed a minimum hourly rate for drivers outside of New York City, where drivers were already subject to minimum rates under Taxi & Limousine Commission rules.

Many rideshare drivers have also sought recognition as employees rather than contractors, so they can have a consistent hourly wage, overtime pay, and benefits. The Department of Labor has issued a final rule that aims to make it more difficult",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1_Kh9h_P4emCAe45VfYL_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/70ebe730-e083-11ee-adb4-2a4cdea0f515,2024-03-29 16:45:28,"for companies to classify workers as independent contractors in the gig economy. The rule requires companies to prove that workers are ""economically independent"" by showing they have control over their work, make their own decisions, and cannot be replaced. While the gig economy has provided new opportunities for flexible work and entrepreneurship, it has also raised concerns about income inequality and job security for gig workers. As the gig economy continues to evolve, it will be important to balance promoting innovation with ensuring that workers have access to fair wages, benefits, and job security.","[Freelance Work, Gig Economy, Uber] for companies to classify workers as independent contractors, rather than employees. The rule, which takes effect on January 7, 2021, requires companies to prove that workers are ""economically independent"" by showing they have control over their work, make their own decisions, and cannot be replaced.

Despite these challenges, the gig economy continues to grow, with more and more people turning to it for flexible work options. The gig economy has also led to the creation of new industries, such as the sharing economy, which allows people to rent out their homes, cars, or even their lawns.

However, the gig economy has also sparked concerns about income inequality and the lack of job security for gig workers. Some have criticized the gig economy for perpetuating the ""gig lifestyle,"" which involves constant hustling for work and lacking the benefits and stability of traditional employment.

In conclusion, the gig economy has revolutionized the way we live and work, offering new opportunities for flexible work options and entrepreneurship. However, it has also raised important questions about the rights and protections of gig workers, and the role of companies in promoting the gig lifestyle.

The RFA unit is expected to reach a $500 million annual run rate this year.
To support its RFA efforts, Stripe recently completed an “acqui-hire” of a four-person team from Supaglue, a startup that provides open-source developer platforms for user-facing integrations. Supaglue has raised a $6.8 million seed round, led by Benchmark general partner Chetan Puttagunta.
Supaglue, formerly known as Supergrain, was founded by George Xing and Thomas Chen, who previously worked on data teams at Lyft and Uber. They recognized that managing data and business metrics across teams was inconsistent and fragmented, which could lead to bad decisions and worse business outcomes. To address this problem, Supaglue built a platform that helps companies import and centralize customer data from third-party sources into their own applications.
The Supaglue acqui-hire is one of several partnerships and acquisitions that Stripe has made this year, including an employee stock sale deal and partnerships with Clerk and Navier. The company has been busy expanding its ecosystem and addressing the growing demand for financial technology solutions.
Stripe’s RFA unit is a unified data platform that reconciles data from its various products, surfaces relevant insights to end-users via dashboards, alerts, customer reporting, and real-time analytics. This platform is very similar to the problem that Supaglue was solving, which highlights the strategic fit between the two companies.
The Supaglue acqui-hire is expected to further enhance Stripe’s RFA capabilities and help the company better serve its customers.

Lightning AI CEO and founder, William Falcon, expressed his excitement about working with Viehmann, stating, ""Thomas literally wrote the book on PyTorch, and he will lead the upcoming performance breakthroughs we will make available to the PyTorch and Lightning AI community.""

Model training can be a time-consuming and costly process, with adversarial AI posing an additional challenge. As attackers train large language models (LLMs) to manipulate and deceive AI systems, organizations face significant threats.

Thunder's capabilities are particularly valuable in addressing these challenges, as it enables efficient use of GPUs and streamlines the training process. By leveraging multiple GPUs, Thunder accelerates the process, ultimately reducing time and costs.

Introduction:
Summer is just around the corner, and many people are already planning their next vacation. With so much to consider when planning a trip, it can be overwhelming. However, Google has a range of tools to help make the process easier. This article will explore five of Google's top tips for planning the perfect summer vacation using its latest tech.

Tip 1: Use AI-powered search to plan your trip
Planning a vacation involves researching the perfect destination, booking the trip, and creating an itinerary. With Google's AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE), you can ask Search to plan a trip with the exact criteria you need. This tool can be as broad or as narrow as you need it to be, making it an excellent resource for planning the perfect vacation.

Tip 2: View curated lists of recommendations in Maps
The lists feature in Maps is super helpful for grouping and saving all the locations you want to visit in one place. Now, Google is enabling users to discover more list recommendations in Google Maps on both browser and mobile (Android or iOS). Users can look up select cities in the US and Canada on maps and see top curated lists of recommendations from publishers and members of the Maps community.

Tip 3: Build itineraries in Maps
Typically, users could not choose how to customize the list order when creating a list in Maps. However, with the new customize list order feature, users can now rank the different locations however they'd like. This feature will be available in Maps later this month on Android or iOS.

Tip 4: Translate your surroundings by pointing your camera
Traveling to a country where you don't speak the native language can be challenging. To help overcome this challenge, users can use Google Lens to easily translate text around them on their travels, such as menus, signs, street names, and more. To use this feature, click the Lens icon on the Google App (iOS and Android) and select the translate button.

Tip 5: Use Google Lens as your pocket tour guide
If you want more information on what is around you while traveling, you can point your camera toward what you want to learn more about and accompany it with a question to get an answer. For example",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/67368207d78007e17a34577fd41476327f70f3df/2024/03/29/5baf7b9a-c131-4821-a6ed-54eca6744c6d/gettyimages-1326412398.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-29 00:00:00,"""What's the history of this building?"" or ""What's a good restaurant nearby?"" Google Lens can help you explore new places and learn more about the things you see.", Trip Planning ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

In recent news, Axios reported that the US Congressional staff members can no longer use Microsoft's Copilot on their government-issued devices. The memo from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor stated that Copilot is now prohibited due to security concerns, especially the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services.

Almost a year ago, the Congress set a strict limit on the use of ChatGPT, which is powered by OpenAI's large language models. The chatbot's free version was banned on House computers, but staffers were allowed to continue using the paid ChatGPT Plus version for research and evaluation due to its tighter privacy controls.

Recently, the White House revealed rules federal agencies have to follow when it comes to generative AI. These rules ensure that any tool they use ""do not endanger the rights and safety"" of Americans. Microsoft recognized government users' need for higher security requirements and announced a roadmap of tools and services meant for government use, including an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and a new version of Microsoft 365's Copilot assistant.

All these tools and services will feature higher levels of security that would make them more suitable for handling sensitive data. However, Szpindor's office will evaluate the government version Copilot when it becomes available before deciding if it can be used on House devices.

In conclusion, the US Congress is taking security concerns seriously by banning Microsoft's Copilot on government-issued devices. It's essential for companies to recognize the need for higher security requirements when dealing with sensitive data.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wDCn8FUMHSGZ9JddUvosHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/f171ef30-ee34-11ee-bf2d-509460709f05,2024-03-30 03:49:46,"Optimized Meta Description: ""Microsoft's Copilot is banned from US Congressional staff devices due to security concerns.
