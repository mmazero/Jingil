https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-efficiency-stable-binary-solar-cells.html,Researchers set new efficiency record for stable binary organic solar cells, Highly efficient and stable binary OSCs with a record PCE of 19.70% ,"Introduction:

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based solar panels due to their lightweight, flexible, and translucent nature. The development of new materials and optimization of the fabrication process have led to a rapid improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs, which has surpassed 19%. However, achieving a balance between efficiency and stability in conventional OSCs remains a challenge.

In this article, we will explore the work of a research group led by Prof. Ge Ziyi from the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who have developed two self-assembled molecules (SAMs) with large dipole moments and employed them as hole-transporting layers (HTLs) in binary OSCs, achieving highly efficient and stable binary OSCs with a record PCE of up to 19.70%.

Body:

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in the field of organic electronic devices due to their advantages of light weight, good mechanical flexibility and translucency. The development of new materials and optimization of the fabrication process have contributed to the rapid improvement in the PCE of OSCs, which has exceeded 19%. However, achieving a balance between efficiency and stability in conventional OSCs still remains a challenge.

To address this issue, researchers at NIMTE designed and synthesized two asymmetric SAMs with asymmetric backbone, namely BrCz and BrBACz. The two SAMs served as HTLs in binary OSCs based on the well-known system of PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8-BO, and D18:eC9, respectively.

Compared with conventional PEDOT:PSS-controlled OSCs, the BrCz-controlled and BrBACz-controlled OSCs exhibited higher transmittance, deeper work function, and lower surface energy, thus realizing enhanced hole extraction, increased hole mobility, decreased interface resistance, and reduced carrier recombination.

The BrBACz-based OSC achieved a record high PCE of 19.70% with a remarkable current density of 29.20 mA cm-2 and a circuit voltage of 0.856 V, which is the highest value reported to date for binary OSCs. When exposed to ambient air (40 ± 5% humidity) and continuous illumination for 1,036 hours, the BrBACz-controlled device can maintain up to 95.0% of its initial efficiency, which is the best air stability for the conventional OSCs.

In addition, the BrBACz-controlled device also plays a remarkable role in other well-known binary systems, such as PM6:Y6, PM6:L8-BO and D18:eC9, demonstrating its excellent generality.

Conclusion:

This work may shed light on the future development and application of highly efficient and stable OSCs through rational molecular structure design. The development of new materials and optimization of the fabrication process have contributed to the rapid improvement in the PCE of OSCs, which has exceeded 19%. However, achieving a balance between efficiency and stability in conventional OSCs still remains a challenge.

Introduction

In our technology-driven world, the demand for efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly electrical power converters is higher than ever. These converters, which are essential components in various devices such as solar panels, medical equipment, and electric vehicles, have traditionally faced challenges in balancing high-frequency operation, reduced size, and minimized electromagnetic noise. Recently, a team of researchers at Kobe University, led by Dr. Mishima Tomokazu, has made significant strides in addressing these challenges with their innovative direct current (DC) voltage boost converter. This article will delve into the groundbreaking features, inner workings, and potential impact of this novel electrical power converter design.

The Challenge: High-Frequency Switching and Electromagnetic Noise

Boost converters are integral components in many electronic devices, converting low-voltage direct current (DC) input into high-voltage DC output. The key to a high-performing boost converter is high-frequency switching, which allows for smaller components and a more compact device. However, faster switching also increases electromagnetic noise and heat production, negatively impacting the converter's performance.

Welcome to the latest edition of TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for news and insights on the future of transportation. Previously, we discussed the turbulence at Fisker, and the situation has only grown more intense. Let's dive into the recent developments, including the fates of bankrupt EV startup Arrival, a promising newcomer Ionobell, and a significant investment in Lucid.

Fisker's Unraveling: A Series of Unfortunate Events

Fisker, the electric vehicle (EV) startup, issued a warning in March, announcing a six-week production halt and revealing its cash reserves. The company had hoped for a $150 million capital influx via convertible notes and a potential partnership with another automaker. However, these expectations went up in flames when negotiations with the reported partner, Nissan, fell apart, causing the convertible note deal to collapse as well. The company's stock plummeted by 28%, trading was halted, and the New York Stock Exchange initiated proceedings to delist Fisker.

One particularly embarrassing revelation by TechCrunch reporter Sean O'Kane uncovered that Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments during its scaling process. This led to an internal audit that took months to complete, further highlighting the company's internal issues.

A Silver Lining for Lucid

Amidst the EV startup bankruptcies and grim news, Lucid managed to secure a $1 billion investment from its largest financial backer, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. This investment provides crucial capital for Lucid but does not guarantee the company's survival. Lucid will need to successfully bring its next vehicle, the Gravity SUV, to market and generate fresh business for its existing Air sedan to scale and survive.

In this week’s issue of TechCrunch Mobility, we explore the rapidly changing landscape of electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on three distinct storylines: the struggles of EV manufacturer Fisker, a lifeline for competitor Lucid through a substantial investment, and breakthroughs in battery technology by emerging startup Ionobell.

Fisker Flounders Amid Financial Turmoil

Electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker finds itself mired in controversy after issuing a dire warning about its financial health earlier this year. After failing to secure a much-needed $150 million capital infusion due to collapsed talks with potential partners like Nissan, Fisker faced severe consequences—a six-week production halt, depleted cash reserves, a collapsing stock price, a halt in trading, and imminent delisting from the NYSE. To add fuel to the fire, it was discovered that Fisker misplaced millions of dollars in customer deposits amidst their scaling efforts, prompting an extensive internal investigation.

Lucid Secures Crucial Backing From Saudi Arabia

Despite bleak prospects across the industry, there remains room for optimism. Luxury EV maker Lucid received a $1 billion commitment from its leading investor, the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, ensuring critical support for ongoing operations. Nevertheless, Lucid faces challenges ahead; they must introduce the Gravity SUV while maintaining sales momentum for their flagship model, the Air sedan, if they hope to thrive and grow.

Revolutionizing Battery Technology With Ionobell’s Groundbreaking Silicon Anode

On a brighter note, early-stage firm Ionobell made waves in the world of battery tech with their innovative use of recycled silicon materials. Their novel approach promises lower costs compared to competitors while significantly increasing energy density in lithium-ion cells, potentially revolutionizing the entire sector.

Introduction

Our planet's reliance on hydrocarbon resources such as crude oil and natural gas presents us with challenges related to extraction difficulties, finitude, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. In response to these concerns, innovative companies are developing alternative methods to create hydrocarbons sustainably. Among these pioneering firms is Terraform Industries, whose novel invention – the Terraformer – promises to revolutionize how we generate synthetic natural gas through electrical power and air conversion. This article introduces Terraform Industries' newly commissioned demonstrator Terraformer capable of producing synthetic natural gas for the first time.

Understanding the Terraformer System

Approximately equivalent to the dimensions of two shipping containers, the Terraformer comprises three primary components:

1. An electrolyzer, responsible for converting solar power into hydrogen
2. A direct air capture mechanism that isolates CO2 from ambient air
3. A chemical reactor that combines both inputs to yield pipeline-quality synthetic natural gas

Each component operates seamlessly with a single-megawatt solar panel installation, forming a comprehensive and inventive system. While individual elements may draw upon established principles from prior centuries, the integration of these parts yields a completely original approach.

Innovation Through Integration

CEO Casey Handmer acknowledges that the underlying concepts aren't necessarily ""super original."" Nevertheless, Terraform Industries brings innovation by integrating these ideas into a unique system, incorporating proprietary direct air capture technology, and designing everything around fluctuating solar power input. Consequently, although each part builds on historical precedents, combining them results in an unprecedented methodology.

Cost Reduction Breakthroughs

By leveraging cutting-edge techniques, Terraform Industries reports impressive cost savings. Their system produces hydrogen at below $2.50 per kilogram—well under current market rates ranging between $5-11 per kilogram. Moreover, Terraform Industries claims its direct air capture unit removes CO2 at less than $250 per metric tonne, significantly cheaper than prevailing costs. These advancements pave the way toward competitive pricing for synthetic natural gas compared to traditionally procured LNG.

Achieving Cost Parity

To attain price equilibrium between synthetic natural gas and conventional sources, Terraform Industries aims to reduce expenses further. Improvements include expanding access to affordable solar power installations and manufacturing thousands of Terraformers annually. By doing so, the firm envisions realizing a paradigm shift in global energy infrastructure.

Capitalizing on Capitalism

Handmer recognizes the necessity of constructing a solid business foundation for Terraform Industries amidst noble environmental goals. As he puts it, scaling technologies requires financial viability rather than depleting funds. To remain economically sustainable, Terraform must continually demonstrate profit potential, thereby attracting capital investment and fostering growth.

Realizing Commercial Potential

Although Burbank, California-based Terraform Industries currently supplies limited quantities of natural gas to two anonymous utility providers, early sales represent significant progress. According to Handmer, successful delivery indicates that Terraform-produced gas aligns with industry quality standards. Additionally, the firm explores opportunities involving standalone electrolyzer devices, fabricating various liquid fuels, and accepting preorders for upcoming Terraformer units. Ultimately, Terraform Industries strives to expand factory capabilities to accommodate mass production required to instigate substantial transformation across worldwide energy networks.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reactor-and-Gas-Injection-System.jpg?resize=1200,772",2024-04-01 17:05:04,Introducing the Terraformer: A Revolutionary Approach to Synthetic Natural Gas Production through Electrical Power and Air Conversion.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-high-purity-cathode-materials-alternative.html,Are high-purity cathode materials truly necessary? An alternative to reduce secondary battery costs,Low-purity lithium for secondary batteries: Cutting costs and emissions,"

Battery purity standards have long been a mystery in the secondary battery industry, with manufacturers insisting on strict specifications from cathode material suppliers to maintain consistent quality output. However, a new study by a team of researchers from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) has revealed that the purity standards set by cell manufacturers may be too stringent, potentially leading to higher battery production costs and carbon emissions.

In their research, the team led by Professor Yong-Tae Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at POSTECH, in collaboration with Professor Kyu-Young Park from the Graduate Institute of Ferrous & Eco Materials Technology and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at POSTECH, and the research team of Dr. Woochul Jung from the Research Institute of Industrial Science and Technology (RIST), found that the presence of approximately 1% magnesium impurity in lithium raw material enhances process efficiency and prolongs the lifespan of secondary batteries.

Traditionally, it is believed that impurities in lithium materials hamper battery performance. Therefore, the goal is to manufacture lithium materials with a purity of at least 99.5%. However, the team's findings suggest that low-purity lithium, not entirely rid of impurities, could reduce secondary battery production costs and carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19.4% and 9.0%, respectively.

The researchers argue that secondary battery cell manufacturers need to reevaluate their current cathode material specifications and consider unconventional approaches to offer a fresh strategy against China's aggressively low prices.

The study's findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.

In this article, we will delve into the impact of lithium raw material purity on the production and performance of secondary battery cathode materials. We will explore the conventional belief that impurities in lithium materials hamper battery performance and examine the research findings that suggest the presence of magnesium impurity in lithium raw material enhances process efficiency and prolongs the lifespan of secondary batteries.

We will also discuss the trade secrets surrounding the purity specifications for cathode materials and how they have led to higher battery production costs. We will examine the research by the team from POSTECH and their findings that low-purity lithium could reduce secondary battery production costs and carbon emissions by up to 19.4% and 9.0%, respectively.

Finally, we will explore the implications of this research for the secondary battery industry and the need for manufacturers to reevaluate their current cathode material specifications.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/microsoft-to-unbundle-office-and-teams-globally-following-years-long-criticism/,Microsoft unbundles Office and Teams globally following years-long criticism, Microsoft removes Teams from Office 365 globally; new standalone pricing option available. ,"In recent news, Microsoft has announced changes to its Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscription services. The company has decided to exclude its business collaboration chat offering, Teams, from these services following scrutiny from the European Union regulator and complaints from rival Slack. This move is unlikely to change the commercial growth trajectory of Office 365, according to some analysts. Microsoft has also introduced a new standalone Teams offering for enterprise customers outside the EU and Switzerland.

The decision to remove Teams from the Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscription services was made in response to concerns raised by the European Commission. Microsoft agreed to sell Office 365 suite sans Microsoft Teams offering in the EU and Switzerland last year. Microsoft has long allowed businesses to pay separately for Teams, but it has also offered the service bundled in the widely popular Office 365 suite.

Some competitors have accused Microsoft of using its market dominance to gain a competitive edge by leveraging Teams. Slack, owned by Salesforce, has termed Microsoft's actions ""illegal"" and alleged that the Windows-maker forced installation of Teams to customers through its market-dominant productivity suite and hid the true cost of the chat and video service.

Microsoft has not addressed these concerns in its blog post, but it has offered flexibility to its existing customers. Existing customers can choose to renew their current deal, update it or select a new offer that better suits their needs. For new customers, Microsoft has introduced standalone pricing for Teams at $5.25 per user per month. Additionally, Office packages without Teams will be available at prices ranging from $7.75 to $54.75, depending on the specific package and features included.

In a note seen by TechCrunch, Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that Microsoft's Monday decision is ""unlikely to change the O365 commercial growth trajectory, as more consolidation (not less) seems to be the direction of travel for CIO's due to macro pressures and technological progress like GenAI driving stronger gains for the broader suites and deeper data sets."" Additionally, providing more choice for purchasing Teams clearly illustrates its compelling value, at just $5.25 per user per month for New Microsoft Teams Enterprise (standalone), which compares to Slack Pro at $7.25/mo and Slack Business+ at $12.50/mo. The price reduction in the Enterprise Suites without Teams is only $2.25, yet the Standalone cost is $5.25. For new customers, this equates to a pricing increase. Using Teams in F1 SKU's costs only $0.50 per user per month and using Teams in Business SKU's cost only $1.25-$2.25 per user per month.

In conclusion, Microsoft's decision to remove Teams from its Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscription services is unlikely to change the commercial growth trajectory of Office 365, as more consolidation seems to be the direction of travel for CIO's due to macro pressures and technological progress like GenAI driving stronger gains for the broader suites and deeper data sets.

OpenAI has made a significant update to its ChatGPT tool. The chatbot is now accessible to the public without requiring users to create and sign into their OpenAI accounts. Instead, users can simply visit the ChatGPT website to access the chatbot.

OpenAI's move to make ChatGPT more accessible is in line with its mission to make AI tools available to everyone. The company is rolling out the change gradually but aims to make ChatGPT accessible to anyone curious about its capabilities.

Whether you have an account or not, OpenAI retains the right to use your conversations with ChatGPT to train its models. However, you can opt out of the company using your data for model training by clicking on the question mark in the bottom left-hand corner, clicking on Settings, and turning off ""Improve the model for everyone.""

To ensure safe practices with the increased availability, OpenAI has included additional content safeguards, such as blocking prompts in a wider range of categories.

While you don't need an account to use ChatGPT, having an OpenAI account comes with some perks, such as the ability to save and review chat history and access custom instructions. You can create an OpenAI account with your email address or by using your existing Apple, Microsoft, or Google account.

This change means that ChatGPT is now as easy to use as Google Search, as both are free to use and don't require signing in. However, it's important to remember that ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff, whereas Google does not.

Overall, OpenAI's move to remove the sign-in wall for ChatGPT is a positive step towards making AI technology more accessible to everyone. With ChatGPT now simple and easy to use, people can try out the chatbot without the hassle of creating an account and signing in every time.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/beyonce-cowboy-carter-is-a-statement-against-ai-music/,Beyoncé's new album 'Cowboy Carter' is a statement against AI music," Beyoncé's Stance on AI-Generated Art: ""Cowboy Carter"" as a Response to Ethical Implications ","The Recording Industry's Response to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the music industry. With the ability to create new tracks in minutes and emulate artists' vocals to a scarily convincing degree, AI-powered music generators have become increasingly popular. However, Beyoncé's recent album, ""Cowboy Carter,"" has sparked a debate about the role of AI in music and the ethical implications of using copyrighted works to train AI models.

Beyoncé's stance on AI-generated art is rooted in her belief that the joy of creating music is that there are no rules. She wants to go back to real instruments and a more authentic sound. While her comments may seem simple, they hold significant weight for fans of the album.

The central criticism of AI-generated art comes from the way this technology works. AI-powered music generators require vast databases of text, images, and sounds to be able to create AI-generated works. Some of the best-known AI companies, like Open AI and Stability AI, use datasets that include copyrighted artworks without consent. This raises ethical concerns about the use of copyrighted works without permission, particularly for rising musicians who don't have the clout to protect themselves.

Beyoncé's stance on AI-generated art is particularly relevant in the context of ""Cowboy Carter."" The album tackles the theft and appropriation of artworks without consent. On the album, Beyoncé is giving listeners a history lesson about how Black musicians formed the foundation of country music, which is often assumed to represent Southern white culture. The title ""Cowboy Carter"" is a nod to the Carters, the ""first family"" of country music, who took the work of Black musicians to develop the style we now know as country. However, the album also addresses the exclusion of Black artists from country music, a truth that has been brought to the forefront by the recent controversy surrounding Beyoncé's ""Texas Hold 'Em"" and an Oklahoma country radio station's refusal to play it.

In conclusion, Beyoncé's stance on AI-generated art is a response to the growing presence of AI in the music industry and the ethical implications of using copyrighted works to train AI models. The central backlash against AI-generated art comes from the way this technology works, and Beyoncé's stance makes even more sense in the context of ""Cowboy Carter."" The album addresses the theft and appropriation of artworks without consent and the exclusion of Black artists from country music, making Beyoncé's stance on AI-generated art even more significant.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/beyonce-ai.jpg?resize=1200,763",2024-04-01 22:45:04,Learn about the music industry's response to AI and how Beyoncé's stance on AI-generated art is relevant to the topic in this article.

This revised SEO title highlights the 20th anniversary of Gmail, emphasizes its massive user base, and briefly mentions how it transformed email usage. By focusing on both the milestone and impactful changes brought about by this service, the title becomes more engaging and clickable while staying within the character limit.","

Email has come a long way since its inception, and one of the most popular email platforms out there today is Gmail. When Gmail was first launched on April 1, 2004, many people dismissed it as an April Fool's Day prank. However, 20 years and 1.2 billion users later, Gmail has become the biggest name in email by a long shot.

What sets Gmail apart from other email platforms is its vast amounts of storage space. Google initially advertised 1 GB of free storage, which was a staggering amount compared to its competitors at the time, like Hotmail and Yahoo. Now, Gmail users can enjoy up to 15 GB of storage per user.

In the early days, Gmail's main focus was on making email more accessible and user-friendly. Features like the ability to search for a specific message and the unprecedented storage space made it easy for users to find and keep their emails. Over the years, Gmail has continued to add new features to enhance the user experience.

One of the most useful features added to Gmail was the forgotten attachment detector. This feature allows users to quickly recover any email attachments they may have forgotten to send. In addition, the ""undo send"" feature has been a lifesaver for those who have accidentally sent an email they didn't mean to.

Gmail also added offline access, making it possible for users to access their emails even when they're not connected to the internet. This feature has been especially useful for those who travel frequently or work in areas with poor internet connectivity.

Over the years, Gmail has also added several other features to make it even more versatile. Smart replies allow users to quickly respond to common emails with pre-written responses. One-click unsubscribe makes it easy to remove unwanted emails from your inbox. An integrated view makes it easy to move between different Google apps, like Google Drive and Google Calendar. Even automatic translation and AI features that can write messages for you have been added to make email more convenient.

Despite its many benefits, Gmail has not been without controversy. Prior to 2017, Google scanned the text of every message to detect spam or malware and to place relevant advertising alongside. After facing several lawsuits, Google stopped reading users' emails and instead used other data sources for contextual ads. In addition, a 2018 report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that third-party developers were able to scan hundreds of millions of user emails.

Despite these controversies, Gmail remains the go-to email platform for many people. While email has certainly changed since its inception, it remains an essential tool for communication and record-keeping. With its vast amounts of storage, user-friendly features, and security, Gmail is not going anywhere anytime soon.

So what does the future hold for Gmail? While the way we communicate has certainly changed in the past two decades, email remains an important part of our daily lives. While other messaging apps like Slack and Teams have become popular for work and personal conversations, Gmail still remains the standard for email communication. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect Gmail to continue to add new features and improvements to make it even more versatile and user-friendly.

In conclusion, Gmail has come a long way since its inception in 2004. With its vast amounts of storage, user-friendly features, and security, Gmail remains the go-to email platform for many people. While email has certainly changed over the years, it remains an essential tool for communication and record-keeping. With its continued evolution and improvements, Gmail is poised to remain the standard for email communication for many years to come.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has relinquished formal control of the eponymously named corporate venture fund to Ian Hathaway, according to a statement from the company. The OpenAI Startup Fund was launched in 2021 with Altman as its named controller. However, this arrangement could have presented a significant challenge to the company had he not been reinstated as CEO following his brief removal in November. The fund's initial GP structure was intended as a temporary arrangement, and Altman had no personal investment or financial interest in the fund, a spokesperson explained.

This news was earlier reported by Axios.

Hathaway joined OpenAI in 2021 and played a vital role in managing the Startup Fund, leading investments in Ambience Healthcare, Cursor, Harvey, and Speak. He was previously an investor with Haystack, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Last year, the fund had $175 million in commitments, and now holds $325 million in gross net asset value, according to an SEC filing. Investors included Microsoft and other external backers. The unit invests in early-stage AI-driven companies in fields like healthcare, law, and education.

The Startup Fund has backed at least 16 other startups, according to PitchBook data. They include Descript, a collaborative editing platform valued at $553 million last year, and Ghost Autonomy, which develops software for autonomous driving.

Energy is a crucial component of modern life, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a prime example of how technology has made it possible to harness energy from various sources. However, the efficiency of electrostatic generators, which are used to power low-power devices in IoT networks, has been hindered by the high impedance mismatch between these generators and electronic devices. Researchers from Microsystems & Nanoengineering have developed a high-performance energy management unit (EMU) that addresses this challenge and significantly boosts the power efficiency of electrostatic generators for IoT devices.

Electrostatic generators have emerged as an appealing solution for powering IoT devices, as they can harvest energy from environmental sources such as wind and human motion. However, their effectiveness has been restricted by the high impedance mismatch when connected to electronic devices, leading to low energy utilization efficiency.

The EMU proposed in this study is designed to address the longstanding challenge of impedance mismatch and propel forward the potential for using environmental energy harvesting within the IoT domain. The research team has implemented an innovative EMU equipped with a spark-switch tube and buck converter. This breakthrough led to an unprecedented direct current output of 79.2 mW m-2 rps-1 in rotary electret generators, representing a significant leap in efficiency. Furthermore, the EMU increased the performance of contact-separated triboelectric nanogenerators by 50%, demonstrating its versatility across different energy-harvesting technologies.

The EMU's success stems from the meticulous optimization of critical components, such as the spark-switch tube and buck converter, which propelled direct current power generation to new heights. This progress not only surpasses existing energy efficiency benchmarks but also underscores the EMU's compatibility with a wide array of generator designs.

Zeyuan Cao, the co-author of the study, stated, ""Our work represents a significant step towards the practical application of electrostatic generators in IoT devices. By optimizing our EMU, we've achieved unprecedented efficiency, making self-powered IoT devices more viable than ever.""

This breakthrough not only enhances the efficiency and reliability of self-powered IoT devices but also facilitates their broader adoption in sustainable and remote applications. It heralds a new era of energy autonomy within the IoT landscape, marking a significant advancement in the realm of environmental energy harvesting for IoT applications.

In conclusion, the EMU developed by the research team is a game-changer in the world of IoT energy harvesting. Its innovative design and implementation have led to unprecedented power efficiency, making it a valuable asset for IoT devices. The potential of this technology is vast, and it is poised to revolutionize the way energy is generated and used in IoT applications.

Hello, dear readers, and happy Easter! It's your favorite content editor here, Aria, and I'm thrilled to share with you some exciting space news.

Have you heard about Orbit Fab's first refueling port officially hitting the market? The cost? A mere $30,000. That's right, just like SpaceX has made rockets reusable, Orbit Fab is making satellites reusable too. According to CEO Daniel Faber, ""In this world today, if you're running a rocket company, and you're not working towards reusable rockets, you're working to a dead end. The same is true of satellites: If you're not making your satellites reusable, you're just putting preordained junk into orbit.""

This week, I had the pleasure of diving deep into China's struggles to secure international partners for its International Lunar Research Station initiative. As a non-Chinese-speaking Westerner, understanding China's space program can be challenging, but Andrew Jones' reporting always sheds light on the subject.

Now, let's travel back in time to April 1, 1960, when NASA launched the very first weather satellite, TIROS 1 (Television and InfraRed Observation Satellite). It's incredible to think that low Earth orbit was once barren, and now it's filled with spacecraft providing us with tons of valuable data on weather.

In the realm of reusable satellites, one company, Spaceango, is making headlines for its innovative approach. The company has developed a unique method for reusing satellites, which involves using 3D printing technology to create new parts when needed. This process not only reduces the cost of space missions but also minimizes the environmental impact of space exploration.

As we continue to venture further into the cosmos, it's fascinating to see how innovative solutions are being developed to tackle the challenges of space exploration. Whether it's reusable rockets or satellites, these advancements are paving the way for a more sustainable future in space.

Introduction:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been gaining popularity in various industries, including stock picking. However, the current technology lags far behind what would be needed to make intelligent choices. In this article, we will review the stock-picking GPTs in OpenAI's GPT marketplace and evaluate their performance in a simple test.

The Test:
We asked all the GPTs in the marketplace to answer the question, ""What is the most expensive tech stock?"" The results were terrible across the board. The GPTs were unable to determine which stock had the highest valuation ratio, which is a crucial aspect of stock valuation.

The Failure of GPTs:
The failure of every single GPT to answer the question of valuation has significant implications. The fact that every one of them produces more or less the same answer suggests they are all drawing from some similar misconception. This misconception is probably coming from the pre-training data in OpenAI's GPT, which is obviously shaped by some collection of conversational data that confuses share price for valuation.

The GPTs clearly don't ""understand"" the question, even though they are in many cases connected to a remote service that presumably is domain-specific for the investing domain. Many of the GPTs ask your permission to contact a remote host, suggesting they're accessing a database. The fact that the programs can't parse a very basic question suggests that despite outside resources, nothing has been done to refine -- or ""fine-tune,"" as it's called -- their grasp of patterns of speech in the domain of stock-picking.

The Importance of the Question:
The question of how expensive or cheap a stock is is a fundamental aspect of stock investing. If you can't handle this simple question, you really can't do any stock investing at all. That means all of the stock investing GPTs at the moment are useless. They may produce a variety of data about companies and stocks, but nothing that would give any valuable insight.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the current AI technology lags far behind what would be needed to make intelligent choices in stock picking. The GPTs in OpenAI's marketplace failed an extremely simple test that would be commonplace in an introductory finance or markets course, or a basic stock investing seminar. The failure of every single GPT to answer the question of valuation has significant implications, and it means that all of the stock investing GPTs at the moment are useless.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/dee638012ded39b7953161a004dc72a21ced50e7/2024/04/01/46514d84-2d1c-4ec6-9427-f71a88e98ed7/stockpricesgettyimages-1330143303.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-01 00:00:00,Meta Description: Evaluate the performance of GPTs in OpenAI's marketplace in a simple stock-picking test.

Microsoft's recent announcement that they will be unbundling Teams from Office 365 may seem like a win for competitors like Slack, but it might not have the impact they think. In fact, it could be a Pyrrhic victory that benefits Microsoft more than it does Slack.

The decision to unbundle Teams is likely a response to regulatory pressure, as Microsoft has faced antitrust complaints from competitors like Slack and the European Union. However, the move could also be a strategic move to attract more customers who don't want to pay for the entire Office 365 suite.

For Slack, the unbundling of Teams could be a significant setback. Although they have 32 million users worldwide, which is 10% of Microsoft's total, Microsoft's bundling strategy has worked well, with over 320 million users. This means that Microsoft has opened up a significant lead in the market, and unbundling Teams may not be enough to close the gap.

However, the unbundling of Teams could also benefit Microsoft in other ways. By unbundling Teams, Microsoft can now sell standalone licenses to companies that don't want to pay for the entire Office 365 suite. This could help them to gain more market share, especially in non-Microsoft shops.

In conclusion, while the unbundling of Teams could be a win for Slack, it might not have the impact they think. Instead, it could be a Pyrrhic victory that benefits Microsoft more than it does Slack. The market has matured, and many larger firms have made their choice. Therefore, unbundling Teams may not have a significant impact on market share.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1284456397.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-01 21:23:06,"Microsoft's Unbundling of Teams: A Strategic Move to Attract More Customers?

Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo, veterans of the industry, have rebranded their Singapore-based operation as Granite Asia. Meanwhile, Hans Tung, a co-founder of the firm who resides in the Bay Area, has announced that the U.S. team will now be known as Notable Capital.

The decision to abandon the GGV Capital brand was based on the fact that both teams would be operating independently going forward, and they felt it was best to develop new brands.

Granite Asia, led by native Singaporeans Lee and Foo, will focus on startups in China, Japan, South Asia, Australia, and Southeast Asia. They are known for their successes, including the smartphone giant Xiaomi, the ride-hail giant Didi, and the delivery company Grab.

Notable Capital, on the other hand, will continue investing in the U.S., as well as in Europe and Latin America. The team is led by Taiwanese-American Tung, who has invested in known brands like Airbnb, StockX, and Slack. Other members of the team include Jeff Richards, who has backed Coinbase, Tile, and Handshake, and Glenn Solomon, who has invested in HashiCorp and Opendoor.

Oren Yunger remains on team Notable and was previously an investor at GGV Capital. Another longtime managing director at GGV Capital, Eric Xu, will continue to oversee the original firm's independently operated yuan-denominated funds.

GGV Capital raised $2.5 billion for its new funds in 2018, marking its largest family of funds ever. The investors have since split those assets under management, and Granite Asia is now managing a collective $5 billion altogether, while Notable Capital has roughly $4.2 billion.

In conclusion, the decision to split GGV Capital's U.S. and Asia operations into two new brands was based on the need for each team to develop its own brand. Both Granite Asia and Notable Capital have experienced success in their respective regions and have a strong track record of investing in successful startups. The split has allowed for more focused investment strategies, and it will be interesting to see how each team performs in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-31-at-11.17.49-AM.png?resize=1200,793",2024-04-01 05:46:34,"GGV Capital Split: Veteran VCs Rebrand U.S. & Asia Operations as Granite Asia & Notable Capital

Emotional Intelligence: The Future of AI

In recent years, we have seen the rise of generative AI models that have shown remarkable intelligence in various benchmarks, even surpassing humans in some tasks. Now, a startup called Hume AI is taking a new approach to AI by introducing the first-ever AI with emotional intelligence.

The Empathetic Voice Interface (EVI) is the flagship product of Hume AI, and it was designed to detect human emotions by analyzing voice tones and language. This AI model combines this knowledge with what the user is saying to craft responses that fit the user's emotional needs.

The demo of EVI is available on the Hume AI website, where users can preview it. I had the opportunity to test it out, and I was thoroughly impressed.

To get started with EVI, users must grant the website access to their microphone. Then, they can begin chatting, and they will receive immediate feedback on their emotional state.

For my first test, I simply spoke to EVI as if I were on a Zoom call with a colleague. When I asked, ""Hey, Hume, how are you?"" EVI responded with surprise, amusement, and interest, indicating that it detected my positive tone.

I then tested EVI with a fake crying voice that said, ""I'm having a hard day."" EVI detected sadness, pain, and distress in my voice and responded with encouraging words, saying, ""Oh no, sounds like you're going through it today. I'm here for you.""

Currently, EVI is only available in beta mode, but Hume AI plans to make it publicly available later this month. If you want to be notified when it is ready, you can fill out this form.

Emotional intelligence is the future of AI, and eLLMs like EVI have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology. As AI continues to become more integrated into our daily lives, it will be crucial for it to understand and respond to our emotions in a way that is both natural and intuitive.

","Canoo's Earnings Report Reveals Gap Between Spending and Revenue
=============================================================

Canoo, the German electric vehicle (EV) startup, released its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 2023 in a regulatory filing. The company is working hard to avoid the same fate as other EV startups, such as recently bankrupt Arrival, by scaling up volume production of its commercial electric vehicles. Canoo's earnings report shows that despite some progress on the expenses and revenue fronts, the company is still burning through cash.

Canoo's Revenue and Losses
---------------------------

In 2023, Canoo generated $886,000 in revenue, which is a significant improvement from zero dollars in 2022. The company delivered 22 vehicles to entities like NASA and the state of Oklahoma, contributing to the increase in revenue. Additionally, Canoo reduced its loss from operations by nearly half, from $506 million in 2022 to $267 million in 2023. However, the revenue-to-losses gap is still considerable, with the company reporting total net losses of $302.6 million in 2023.

Canoo's Private Jet Usage
--------------------------

One of the most interesting aspects of Canoo's earnings report is the private jet usage of CEO Tony Aquila. Under a deal reached in November 2020, Canoo reimburses Aquila Family Ventures, an entity owned by the CEO, for use of an aircraft. In 2023, Canoo spent $1.7 million on this reimbursement, which is double the amount of revenue it generated. Canoo paid Aquila Family Ventures $1.3 million in 2022 and $1.8 million in 2021 for use of the aircraft.

Additionally, Canoo also paid Aquila Family Ventures $1.7 million in 2023, $1.1 million in 2022, and $500,000 in 2021 for shared services support in its Justin, Texas, corporate office facility, according to regulatory filings. These expenses add to the financial burden on the company, which is already struggling to keep up with its revenue targets.

Conclusion
----------

Canoo's earnings report highlights the gap between spending and revenue at the EV startup. Despite some progress on the expenses and revenue fronts, the company is still burning through cash and facing the risk of bankruptcy. The private jet usage of CEO Tony Aquila is particularly concerning, given the substantial cost of reimbursement. Canoo needs to focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenses to avoid the same fate as other EV startups. As the company continues to navigate the challenges of the EV market, it will be interesting to see if they can turn things around and achieve profitability.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-04-01 23:53:42,"Get the scoop on Canoo's earnings report: see how the EV startup is doing financially and what private jet usage is costing them.

However, there are some significant reasons why TMTG’s losses are worth taking a closer look at.

First, after merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp. through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), TMTG went public on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol $DJT. This means that the company is now accountable to its shareholders, which can lead to increased scrutiny and pressure to perform financially. TMTG recently filed its first quarterly financial report, which revealed that the company lost $58 million on only $4 million in revenue. This impressive loss is unheard of for a tech startup, and it’s clear that TMTG is struggling to find its footing.

Second, the financial press has been quick to jump on the story, and the upshot is that TMTG’s financials are not what they seem. While it’s common for early-stage startups to operate with losses, TMTG’s losses are not justified by its revenue. Truth Social, the main business of TMTG, has failed to attract more than a few million users, and it has not demonstrated the kind of traction that any startup would need to suggest that it’s the next big thing. The low revenue numbers tell us that advertisers don’t want to pay for what audience is there.

Finally, the lack of traction and revenue make it clear that TMTG doesn’t have the potential for explosive growth. Venture capital is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that props up fundamentally unprofitable businesses until they can make money. However, TMTG doesn’t have the freedom to take risks and throw cash around. Instead, the company is accountable to its shareholders, which means that it has to focus on profitability. Unfortunately, given the majority owner’s personal, political, legal, and business woes, there is a very real risk that the whole thing will implode before the year is out.

In conclusion, while it’s common for startups to struggle financially, TMTG’s losses are not justified by its revenue or growth potential. Its failure to attract more than a few million users and its lack of traction make it clear that TMTG doesn’t have the potential for explosive growth. The fact that the company is now accountable to its shareholders means that it has to focus on profitability, which may not be possible. Given the majority owner’s personal and business challenges, there is a very real risk that the whole thing will implode before the year is out.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/truth-social-trump.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-01 19:35:25,"Meta Description:

Introduction

The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) has recently targeted Apple's control over the App Store ecosystem for iPhone apps, accusing the tech giant of stifling competition. As a result, Apple is now required to open up to new competitors, providing an opportunity for alternative app stores to emerge and flourish. One such alternative app store is the AltStore, which is gearing up to take advantage of the DMA by launching an updated version of its app marketplace in the EU, complete with Patreon-backed apps.

The AltStore's Unique Business Model

The AltStore, founded by developer Riley Testut, has been quick to seize this opportunity. The store will allow developers to use its custom Patreon integration to market their apps directly to consumers, creating a new business model for app monetization without Apple's traditional 15% to 30% commission on sales. Instead, alternative app stores like the AltStore can opt to pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold, a scheme that taps into the revenue of larger apps, known as the Core Technology Fee.

App Distribution Through Patreon

Once the AltStore is up and running smoothly, Testut plans to allow other developers to distribute their apps through the storefront by establishing their own sources. These developers will also be able to use the same Patreon integration that the AltStore uses to distribute 'paid' apps, creating a more personal relationship with users and letting them use the same reward system they use for videos, blog posts, merch, and other content.

A More Secure and User-Friendly Experience

In addition to offering developers a new way to make money, Testut claims that the EU version of the AltStore will be ""dramatically simpler"" to use compared with the current version. Users who want to sideload apps via the AltStore without jailbreaking their iPhone currently have to use a Mac or PC, provide the AltStore with their Apple ID and password, and then refresh the apps every seven days. This process raises security concerns and is complex. However, the EU version of the AltStore won't require these steps, making it more secure and user-friendly.

It adheres to best practices for SEO titles by being concise, informative, and keyword-rich.","Title: Telegram's New Business Features: A Game Changer in Enterprise Communication?

Introduction

Telegram, the popular messaging platform, has unveiled an array of new features targeting businesses, aiming to rival industry giants such as Meta's WhatsApp and Messenger. These innovative tools not only improve communication between enterprises and clients but also pave the way for profit generation—aligning with founder Pavel Durov's goal of making Telegram a sustainable venture by 2025. Let us explore these exciting developments and assess their potential impact on the competitive landscape of enterprise communication solutions.

A Closer Look at Telegram Business

Launched during the recent weekend, Telegram Business brings several advanced functionalities tailored explicitly for commercial entities. Key highlights include:

 Customizable start pages
 Configurable business hours
 Preset replies and greeting/away messages
 Chatbot integration
 Color-coded chat categories
 Specialized customer interaction management

Moreover, public channels boasting at least 1,000 subscribers can earn 50% of the advertising revenues displayed in their respective channels. With over 900 million active users, Telegram presents a lucrative opportunity for both businesses seeking improved client interactions and investors looking for promising returns.

Monetization Through Subscription Models

To unlock these premium features, users must upgrade to the paid Telegram Premium tier, priced at $4.99 per month on mobile platforms (with various discounted plans available for longer durations). Interestingly, since Telegram does not rely on third-party application stores for sales, it enjoys higher profit margins compared to competitors encumbered by commissions and fees. As evidenced by rapid subscriber growth (topping one million users within two months), Telegram Premium appears poised for success.

Competitive Advantage Over Existing Players

Meta currently dominates the enterprise communications sector through its suite of applications, namely Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, Telegram's unique selling proposition stems from its focus on providing specialized tools catering specifically to businesses, thus setting itself apart from generic consumer-oriented platforms. Furthermore, even tech titans like Apple struggle to carve significant niches in this highly contested domain.

Conclusion

By harnessing artificial intelligence, chatbot technology, and targeted feature sets, Telegram positions itself strategically in the ever-evolving world of enterprise communication. While challenges remain, particularly concerning privacy concerns and regulatory compliance, the platform demonstrates remarkable promise in disrupting established players and capturing substantial market shares. Only time will tell if these bold moves propel Telegram towards unprecedented expansion and solidify its foothold as a major player in the global digital arena.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gettyimages-917260478.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-01 18:51:57,"Meta Description: Discover how Telegram's new business features & monetization strategies revolutionize enterprise communication, offering customizable start pages, chatbot integration, and revenue-sharing for public channels.

Astra's Rocket 3.0 Ended in Disaster During Prelaunch Testing

In March 2020, Astra's Rocket 3.0 suffered a catastrophic explosion during prelaunch testing at Alaska's Pacific Spaceport Complex. The explosion was initially reported as an ""anomaly,"" an industry term for any issue that deviates from the expected outcome. However, it was a clear indication of the rocket's failure.

At the time, Astra CEO Chris Kemp told TechCrunch that the rocket ""suffered an anomaly following an otherwise successful day of testing in Kodiak in preparation for a launch this week."" Meanwhile, Alaska Aerospace CEO Mark Lester told local reporters that the company was executing an emergency checklist and requested everyone to stay clear of the area. However, the video clip obtained by TechCrunch showed the micro launcher burst into flames, and it was clear that the vehicle did not survive.

At the time of the failure, Astra was taking such failures in stride. The company believed that it could build rockets at such a high volume and at such a low price that some amount of failure could be priced in. Kemp summed it up in a May 2022 interview, saying, ""The expectation I think that a lot of people have is every launch has to be perfect. I think what Astra has to do, really, is we have to have so many launches nobody thinks about it anymore.""

Despite its initial success, Astra failed to materialize its plans, and after months of burning cash, the company's board quietly accepted a take-private deal from Kemp and CTO Adam London at a stock price of just $0.50 per share. The deal is expected to close sometime this quarter, and Astra will cease trading on the Nasdaq.

Astra did not return a request for comment on the 2020 launch failure. However, the video clip obtained by TechCrunch serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of space exploration and the importance of ensuring the reliability of rocket launches.

Astra had been one of the biggest success stories for space industry investors, with the startup going public in July 2021 at a $2.1 billion valuation after raising nearly $500 million for its ultra-low-cost launch plans. However, the failure to materialize these plans has left a significant impact on the space industry, and Astra's take-private deal serves as a cautionary tale for other space startups.

In conclusion, Astra's Rocket 3.0 ended in disaster during prelaunch testing in March 2020.
