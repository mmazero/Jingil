https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/how-ukraines-cyber-police-fights-back-against-russias-hackers/,How Ukraine’s cyber police fights back against Russia's hackers, Placeholder for the SEO title. ,"On February 24, 2022, the world witnessed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, marking a significant turning point in the nation's history. This event dramatically altered the lives of every citizen, including those serving in the Ukrainian forces, civilians enduring the consequences of armed conflict, and the Cyberpolice of Ukraine, whose mission and objectives shifted drastically due to these unprecedented circumstances.

Yevhenii Panchenko, Chief of Division at the Cyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine, shared his insights during a discussion held at the Chainalysis LINKS Conference in New York City. He emphasized how the role and duties of the Cyberpolice evolved since the beginning of the full-scale war. With approximately one thousand personnel members, roughly forty of whom specialize in tracking crypto-related offenses, the Cyberpolice focuses on combatting ""all manifestations of cybercrime in cyberspace."" Following the war's outbreak, their mandate expanded further: actively opposing aggression in cyberspace became another crucial aspect of their responsibilities.

After the invasion, the scope of the Cyberpolice's duties widened significantly. Their primary roles include documenting war crimes committed by Russian soldiers, posting on social media platforms; tracing the influx of cryptocurrencies fueling the war efforts; debunking disinformation schemes; probing ransomware assaults; and educating residents on secure cyberpractices. In this article, you will learn about the transformed responsibilities assumed by the Cyberpolice amidst wartime Ukraine.

Tracking War Crimes & Investigating Hacking Attacks

Since the invasion, the Cyberpolice took up several new assignments, such as gathering intel on Russian troops—a duty previously unfamiliar to them. As Panchenko explained, ""Now we're trying to accumulate all the proof we can gather because they too have adjusted, hiding their social media profiles that we once utilized to recognize individuals involved in the occupying forces employed by the Russians to seize our towns and murder innocent civilians.""

Additionally, the organization identifies and examines incidents involving Russian hackers attacking Ukraine's digital infrastructure. These acts may entail distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, site defacement attempts, and overall information sabotage. Due to the absence of collaboration between Ukrainian and Russian law enforcement agencies, finding alternative methods for exchanging vital data with domestic intelligence services becomes essential.

Furthermore, certain departments safeguard critical national infrastructure within the cyber realm. Given the increasing number of cyberattacks aimed at crippling key sectors alongside traditional military operations, protecting these assets remains paramount.

Uncovering Digital Evidence of War Crimes

While most associate war crimes with physical confrontations, digital traces offer valuable insight into potential violations. According to Panchenko, Russian troops frequently share visual content via social media, displaying various aspects of the war. Such posts often serve as evidence incriminating soldiers guilty of wrongdoings. Examples include publishing random shots around urban environments or filming indiscriminate firing using heavy artillery without selecting appropriate targets. Gathered materials support ongoing investigations conducted by Ukrainian offices pursuing justice against Russian adversaries.

Addressing Evolving Ransomware Threats

Post-invasion, changes emerged in the prevalence of ransomware activities across Ukraine. Previously motivated by financial gains, recent attacks prioritize demonstrating effectiveness over monetary rewards. Instead of deploying elaborate encryption mechanisms and demanding payments, threat actors quickly disable systems and deface websites merely to exhibit strength. Consequently, distinguishing between criminal entities operating independently and state-backed hacker divisions poses formidable challenges.

In summary, the invasion forced the Cyberpolice of Ukraine to adapt swiftly and assume additional responsibilities. From amassing proof of war crimes to counteracting enemy advances in both the physical and virtual battlefields, the agency plays a pivotal role in preserving safety and security throughout the region. By capitalizing on technological advancements and fostering international collaborative efforts, the Cyberpolice aims to protect Ukraine's interests while maintaining resilience in the face of mounting adversities.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/yevhenii-panchenko-cyberpolice-ukraine.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-12 14:52:47,"Meta Description:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/security-engineer-jailed-for-3-years-for-12m-crypto-hacks/,Security engineer jailed for 3 years for $12M crypto hacks, Cybersecurity Engineer Jailed for $12M Crypto Theft: A Fall from Grace ,"Title: A Cybersecurity Engineer's Fall from Grace: Stealing Millions in Cryptocurrency

A former cybersecurity engineer, Shakeeb Ahmed, made headlines when he was sentenced to three years in prison for stealing nearly $12 million in cryptocurrency. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the sentence following Ahmed's conviction of hacking into two cryptocurrency exchanges. Let's delve deeper into the story and explore the implications of such actions in the ever-evolving landscape of digital currency.

The Heist:

Shakeeb Ahmed, once employed as a senior security engineer for an international technology firm, exploited his skills to gain unauthorized access to two cryptocurrency exchanges. Although his LinkedIn profile indicated previous work experience at Amazon, the tech giant clarified that he was not affiliated with them during his arrest. One of his targets remained undisclosed; however, Crema Finance, a Solana-based platform, confirmed being among the breached exchanges in early July 2022. Shortly after, Nirvana Finance fell prey to another attack resulting in the loss of $9 million and $3.6 million, respectively – effectively exhausting its entire financial reserves leading to its subsequent closure.

Attempted Redemption:

Interestingly, instead of vanishing with the illicit proceeds, Ahmed reached out to Crema Finance in hopes of negotiating a deal. Claiming he had discovered vulnerabilities allowing the theft, he offered to return most of the stolen assets in exchange for a $1.5 million ""finder's fee"" and immunity from legal consequences. However, when Crema Finance refused the offer, Ahmed's attempts were thwarted, culminating in his eventual capture.

White Hatting or Black Hat Behavior?

Although common practice in the crypto realm, these types of agreements blending ethical hacking (""white hatting"") with questionable conduct (stealing funds) create confusion regarding acceptable norms. Regardless of justifications provided within the crypto community, such activities remain illegal under traditional definitions of computer intrusion and larceny statutes. As seen in Ahmed's case, law enforcement does not share the same leniency towards these practices.

Consequences and Sentencing:

For his crimes, Ahmed received a three-year prison term accompanied by three additional years of supervised release post-incarceration. Additionally, he was ordered to forfeit $12.4 million along with a substantial quantity of seized cryptocurrencies. Restitution totaling over $5 million was mandated for repayment to both affected exchanges. This serves as a stark reminder that criminal activity, irrespective of motivation or rationale, carries severe ramifications.

This incident underscores the necessity for increased vigilance and education surrounding cybersecurity best practices within the rapidly growing cryptocurrency sector. Furthermore, it highlights the critical role transparency plays in fostering trust between users, service providers, and regulatory bodies alike.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fbi-bitcoin-dark-web.jpg?resize=1200,638",2024-04-12 16:39:59,"Discover how a cybersecurity expert stole millions in cryptocurrency & got caught!

Although some perceive this phenomenon as strange, it highlights the growing interest in tabletop roleplaying games and their capacity to engage audiences worldwide.

Ticketmaster's Double-Edged Sword

Unfortunately, the anticipation for Dimension 20's performance is tempered by ticketing frustrations caused by Ticketmaster's policies. During Taylor Swift's recent concert announcement, fans endured long wait times, causing widespread outrage. Similarly, Dimension 20 viewers face escalating prices through Ticketmaster's dynamic system; initial offerings reached astronomical figures before gradually decreasing—still significantly higher than typical rates. Predictably, disgruntled fans took notice, particularly given Dimension 20's explicitly anti-capitalist themes.

A Silver Lining Amid Controversy

Although ticketing difficulties persist, skyrocketing demand for such events indicates a bright future for actual play productions and the creator economy overall. Ten years ago, grandiose performances featuring online personalities seemed farfetched. Today, however, successful YouTube creators easily rival mainstream celebrity status. Even Dropout, the firm responsible for producing Dimension 20, rose from the ashes of CollegeHumor when one executive revived the brand, evolving it into a thriving platform generating various popular comedy programs.

Conclusion

Dimension 20's success signals a shift towards greater acceptance of digital creators in our society. Despite obstacles presented by ticketing services like Ticketmaster, the enthusiasm surrounding these unique experiences demonstrates the boundless potential of actual play shows and their impact on modern entertainment.

Introduction:
In the rapidly evolving world of cybersecurity, mergers and acquisitions are becoming increasingly common. One such potential deal involves Noname Security, a startup specializing in API protection, and Akamai Technologies. Although the deal is not yet finalized, it has the potential to significantly impact the cybersecurity landscape. Here's what we know so far.

The Core Facts:
Noname Security, co-founded in 2020 by Oz Golan and Shay Levi, has been in advanced talks with Akamai Technologies. The deal is reportedly valued at $500 million, a substantial discount from Noname's last private valuation of $1 billion. Despite this, early-stage investors are set to receive a meaningful return, while later-stage investors may secure a full return on their investment.

The deal would value Noname Security at approximately 15 times its annual recurring revenue. If finalized, Noname's around 200 employees are expected to join Akamai's workforce. Akamai has declined to comment, while Noname Security has refrained from addressing rumors or speculation.

The Rewind:
Noname Security, headquartered in Palo Alto with Israeli roots, has swiftly made a name for itself in the cybersecurity industry. Co-founded in 2020, the startup has already raised an impressive $220 million from venture investors, including Insight Partners, ForgePoint, Cyberstarts, Next47, and The Syndicate Group.

In December 2021, Noname raised $135 million in a Series C led by Georgian and Lightspeed, valuing the company at $1 billion. However, the current sale price represents a significant discount from this valuation.

The Road Ahead:
The potential union of Noname Security and Akamai Technologies could create a formidable force in the cybersecurity market, particularly in API protection. APIs are a critical component of modern software development, making their security a pressing concern for businesses worldwide.

However, the deal is not yet final, and the current market conditions could influence its outcome.
