Truth Social, the social media platform owned by Donald Trump’s media company, has announced plans to launch a live TV streaming platform. The platform aims to provide a permanent home for high-quality news and entertainment that face discrimination by other channels and content delivery services. In this blog post, we will explore the details of the streaming service, its launch phases, and how it differs from other platforms.

Body:

Truth Social’s live TV streaming platform will focus on “news networks,” “religious channels,” and “other content that has been cancelled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services,” according to a press release. The service will also feature “family-friendly” content, including films and documentaries. The streaming service will launch in three phases. The company first plans to introduce Truth Social’s CDN (content delivery network) for streaming to the Truth Social app for Android, iOS, and the web. Next, Truth Social plans to release over-the-top (“OTT”) streaming apps for phones, tablets, and other devices. The last phase of the rollout involves the launch of a streaming app for TVs.

Truth Social says it has tested the streaming service on its web and iOS platforms for six months and has “finished the research and development phase.” The company is excited to move forward with the next big phase for Truth Social. With its streaming content, the company aims to provide a permanent home for high-quality news and entertainment that face discrimination by other channels and content delivery services.

The announcement comes as Elon Musk’s X has been focused on trying to turn the social media site into a free-speech “video-first” platform. The social network currently features an original show hosted by former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and another by former Fox Sports host Jim Rome. Last month, Musk cancelled a talkshow deal with former CNN anchor Don Lemon after the multibillionaire was interviewed for the first episode of the show.

Truth Social went public last month after shareholders approved a merger of TMTG and Digital World Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The company’s stock slumped this week after it said it would sell more shares to raise cash. Although the company is worth billions of dollars, TMTG is struggling to make money: It reportedly had a net loss of around $49 million in 2023 and made just under $4 million in revenue.

Conclusion:

Truth Social’s live TV streaming platform aims to provide a permanent home for high-quality news and entertainment that face discrimination by other channels and content delivery services.

Let's explore this exciting development and what it means for the future of online shopping.

Amazon Live's FAST Channel: A New Shopping Experience

Amazon Live, initially launched in 2019, has now expanded its presence by introducing a 24/7 live channel featuring popular creators, celebrities, and brands. Reality TV stars Lala Kent from ""Vanderpump Rules"" and Paige DeSorbo from ""Southern Charm"" are among the personalities who will host streams to showcase and sell their favorite products. Brands like Tastemade and The Bump will also be part of the live channel lineup.

The interactive shoppable content will be accessible to viewers through the Amazon Shopping app on their mobile devices. By entering ""shop the show"" into the search bar, users will be directed to a shopping carousel featuring the products displayed during the livestream.

The Benefits of Live Shopping

Live shopping combines the convenience of e-commerce with the entertainment value of live television.

Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, our reliance on electronic devices is greater than ever before. From smartphones to cameras, these gadgets have become essential tools for work, leisure, and adventure. To ensure their longevity, carrying a dependable power bank is vital. Enter the Klarus K5, an ultra-rugged, waterproof power bank designed to meet the demands of an active, outdoor lifestyle. In this review, we will explore the unique features and benefits of this remarkable device.

Unmatched Durability and Element Resistance

The Klarus K5 boasts an IP68 rating, meaning it is completely protected against dust ingress and capable of withstanding immersion in water beyond one meter depth. Specifically, the K5 can remain submerged in up to 10 meters of water without sustaining damage. During testing, the power bank demonstrated exceptional resilience to both dust and water, providing peace of mind during outdoor excursions. Although port covers would further improve protection, the current design effectively repels liquids through simple shaking.

Slim and Lightweight Design

Weighing in at only 157 grams, the Klarus K5 is remarkably slim and lightweight compared to similar products on the market. Featuring a carbon fiber exterior, this power bank combines style and durability while maintaining a minimalist profile. With dimensions measuring 105.7 x 63.4 x 13.6 millimeters, the K5 fits comfortably in pockets or bags, making it an indispensable companion for travelers, adventurers, and daily commuters alike.

Powerful Performance and Versatile Connectivity

Equipped with a 10,000 mAh capacity, the Klarus K5 provides ample power for charging mobile phones, tablets, and other compatible devices. A single charge can replenish an iPhone 15 Pro Max several times over or supply continuous energy to a GoPro for timelapse photography. Furthermore, the power bank supports trickle-charging technology, allowing safe and efficient charging of low-capacity devices like earbuds.

Featuring dual USB ports (Type-A and Type-C) for versatile connectivity, users can simultaneously charge multiple devices or utilize the reversible USB-C connection for both input and output purposes. Accompanied by a user-friendly on/off switch and a bright LCD screen, monitoring battery levels becomes effortless. Despite its diminutive size, the K5 punches above its weight class, delivering powerful performance in a highly portable package.

Conclusion

Overall, the Klarus K5 proves itself as an exemplary power bank tailored for individuals seeking reliability, durability, and convenience. Though some improvements could be implemented, such as adding port protectors, the K5 remains a top pick among portable chargers. Whether embarking on a backpacking trip, navigating city streets, or simply ensuring your phone never dies midday, trust the Klarus K5 to deliver consistent performance and endurance under pressure.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d6d13e7a62952a5e1cbe57f07553849424339162/2024/04/16/7d92016a-88f3-48d7-a99f-83af8c606f3f/img-9415.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-16 00:00:00,"""Discover the rugged & waterproof Klarus K5 power bank!
