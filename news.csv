https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/22/att-customers-data-leak-online/,AT&T won't say how its customers' data spilled online, AT&T Data Breach: 73 Million Customers' Personal Info Exposed ,"AT&T's Massive Data Breach: 73 Million Customers Affected

In a startling turn of events, a massive data breach at AT&T has exposed the personal information of approximately 73 million customers. This revelation comes three years after a hacker initially hinted at the theft, leaving many questions unanswered.

Leaked Data Includes Sensitive Information

The leaked dataset, which has been analyzed by security experts, contains a trove of sensitive personal information, including:

 Names
 Home addresses
 Phone numbers
 Social Security numbers
 Dates of birth

The authenticity of the data has been confirmed by AT&T customers who have verified the accuracy of their leaked information.

AT&T's Response and Ongoing Mystery

AT&T initially dismissed the breach in 2021, claiming that the leaked data did not originate from their systems. However, the company has since remained silent on the source of the data or its validity.

Security researcher Troy Hunt, who obtained a copy of the leaked dataset, has verified its authenticity. Hunt's analysis revealed that the dataset contains 49 million unique email addresses, 44 million Social Security numbers, and customer dates of birth.

Despite the overwhelming evidence, AT&T continues to maintain that there is no indication of a compromise of their systems. The spokesperson's response suggests that the company is either unaware of the source of the breach or unwilling to disclose it.

Unresolved Questions and Lack of Transparency

The source of the breach remains a mystery, with AT&T failing to provide any concrete explanations. It is unclear whether the data originated from AT&T itself, a third-party processor, or an unrelated entity.

The lack of transparency from AT&T is concerning, as millions of customers have had their sensitive information compromised. The company has a responsibility to inform its customers about the breach, its source, and the steps it is taking to protect their data.

Conclusion

Three years after the initial hack, the AT&T data breach remains unsolved. The company's silence and lack of transparency have left customers in the dark about the extent of the breach and the potential risks to their personal information. AT&T must prioritize the security of its customers' data and provide a full and accurate account of this incident.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/att.jpg?resize=1200,640",2024-03-22 18:55:17,Massive AT&T Data Breach: Protect Your Data Now!, Data Breach ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

In the face of ongoing conflict, Ukraine's tech ecosystem continues to thrive, giving rise to a growing number of startups led by Ukrainian entrepreneurs. To support this burgeoning industry, 1991 Ventures, a London-based venture capital firm, has emerged with a mission to invest in Ukrainian and Central Eastern European (CEE) startup talent.

The 1991 Ventures Fund: A Lifeline for Ukrainian Startups

Founded by Ukrainian brothers Denis and Viktor Gursky, 1991 Ventures boasts a £15 million ($18.8 million) fund dedicated to supporting Ukrainian and CEE startups. Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing war, the fund recognizes the untapped potential within Ukraine's tech sector.

Ukrainian Startups: A Force to Be Reckoned With

Despite the conflict, Ukrainian startups have demonstrated remarkable resilience. Between 2016 and 2024, the Gursky brothers supported over 200 startups through their incubator, Social Boost, and accelerator, 1991 Accelerator. These startups include AXDRAFT (legal tech), eTolls (European toll payment app), and Osavul (cybersecurity company).

A Gateway to Global Funding

1991 Ventures aims to bridge the gap between Ukrainian founders and the global investment community. By providing pre-seed or seed funding, the fund empowers Ukrainian startups to access larger funding rounds in the future. Additionally, it positions the United Kingdom as a springboard for Ukrainian startups seeking global expansion.

A Thriving Ukrainian VC Ecosystem

1991 Ventures joins a growing roster of Ukrainian-born venture capital funds supporting the local startup ecosystem. These funds include Roosh Ventures, SID Venture Partners, SMRK, Flyer One Ventures, and TA Ventures, which has invested in over 200 startups, including 15 Ukrainian ones.

The Future of Ukrainian Tech

As Ukraine rebuilds, its tech sector is poised to play a pivotal role. Many of the tech companies that will emerge in the coming years are expected to focus on dual-use technologies or defense-related applications. For instance, the number of companies producing drones in Ukraine has surged from seven in 2022 to almost 200 in 2023.

Conclusion

Amidst the ongoing conflict, Ukraine's startup ecosystem remains a beacon of hope and resilience. With the support of venture capital funds like 1991 Ventures, Ukrainian entrepreneurs continue to innovate and build businesses that will shape the future of Ukraine and beyond. The country's tech sector is a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people, who are determined to rebuild and thrive despite the challenges they face.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1991-Ventures.jpg?w=806,2024-03-22 18:08:56,"Discover the latest tech trends!

Introduction

Apple, once known for its relatively light regulatory scrutiny, is now facing a growing number of antitrust challenges worldwide. This article examines the company's recent antitrust lawsuit in the United States and explores the broader regulatory landscape that Apple faces in Europe and beyond.

Antitrust Lawsuit in the United States

On March 2, 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, alleging that the company is a monopolist in the high-end and U.S. smartphone markets. The DOJ accuses Apple of engaging in anti-competitive practices that harm consumers and stifle innovation.

International Antitrust Scrutiny

Apple has also faced antitrust scrutiny and interventions in other markets. In Europe, the European Union (EU) recently fined Apple nearly $2 billion for anti-steering rules that prevented music streaming services from informing users of cheaper offers outside the App Store.

The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) has further tightened the regulatory landscape for Apple. The DMA imposes specific behavioral requirements on designated mobile gatekeepers, such as Apple, including allowing app sideloading, alternative app stores, and fair treatment of business users.

Regulatory Actions in Other Countries

Other countries have also taken action against Apple's practices. Germany has designated Apple as subject to its own ex ante competition reform, while South Korea and India have investigated Apple's in-app payment commissions. The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also scrutinizing Apple's mobile app store, cloud gaming, and mobile web browser restrictions.

The Brussels Effect

The EU's DMA is expected to have a significant impact on antitrust enforcements worldwide. As the EU sets the global standard for regulating digital technologies, other countries may follow suit, leading to increased regulatory pressure on Apple and other tech giants.

Apple's Response

Apple has made some concessions in response to regulatory pressure, such as allowing app sideloading in Europe and offering concessions on Apple Pay. However, the company has also resisted certain measures, such as the EU's DMA core tech fee.

Conclusion

Apple is facing a challenging antitrust landscape both domestically and internationally. The DOJ's lawsuit and the EU's DMA are significant developments that could reshape the company's business practices. As other countries adopt similar regulations, Apple will need to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment to maintain its market position.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/apple-ghost-logo.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-22 17:10:20,"Explore Apple's global antitrust challenges.

Apple has made some concessions in response to regulatory pressure, such as allowing app sideloading in Europe and offering concessions on Apple Pay. However, the company has also resisted certain measures, such as the EU's DMA core tech fee.

Conclusion

Apple is facing a challenging antitrust landscape both domestically and internationally. The DOJ's lawsuit and the EU's DMA are significant developments that could reshape the company's business practices. As other countries adopt similar regulations, Apple will need to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment to maintain its market position.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spyware-nso-eyes.jpg?resize=1200,732",2024-03-22 13:47:48,"Uncover Apple's Antitrust Challenges Worldwide: Lawsuits, Investigations, and Regulatory Pressures.", Ukrainian Startups ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Atomos Space's inaugural mission, Mission-1, has been a testament to the challenges and rewards of space exploration. Despite facing numerous obstacles, the company has persevered, demonstrating the resilience and ingenuity of its team.

Mission Objectives and Early Challenges

Mission-1 aims to showcase complex spacecraft maneuvers, including rendezvous, docking, and on-orbit refueling. However, the mission encountered two major issues: communication difficulties and excessive spacecraft rotation.

Communication Woes

After deployment, Atomos experienced prolonged delays in receiving data from the spacecraft. The culprit was a mismatch between the spacecraft's speed and the Iridium satellites used for communication. To resolve this, engineers modified the spacecraft's software to ensure continuous radio transmissions.

Uncontrolled Rotation

The spacecraft also began tumbling at an alarming rate, threatening to deplete their batteries. Engineers analyzed data and discovered that the spacecraft's rotation was preventing them from maintaining solar alignment. They gradually slowed the rotation and established a high-bandwidth communication link, providing valuable insights into the spacecraft's health.

Overcoming Obstacles

Despite these setbacks, the Atomos team remained determined. They drew upon their deep understanding of the spacecraft's design to troubleshoot and implement solutions. The high-bandwidth communication link provided a wealth of data, enabling engineers to identify and address issues such as battery degradation and GPS malfunction.

Upcoming Milestones

With the communication and rotation problems resolved, Atomos is now preparing to commission the spacecraft's propulsion system. Successful testing will pave the way for spacecraft separation and the completion of the mission's objectives by the end of June.

Lessons Learned

Atomos Space's Mission-1 has highlighted the importance of vertical integration in space exploration. The company's ability to design, build, and operate its own spacecraft allowed it to respond quickly to unexpected challenges. The experience has also reinforced the value of perseverance and the ability to learn from setbacks.

As Atomos Space continues its mission, it serves as an inspiration to other space ventures. The company's unwavering determination and innovative solutions demonstrate that even the most daunting challenges can be overcome with ingenuity and a relentless pursuit of success.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Atomos-Mission-One-Rendering-.jpg?w=820,2024-03-22 22:59:10,Discover Atomos Space's Triumphant Mission-1: Overcoming Challenges in Space Exploration, Ukrainian Startups ,Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"
