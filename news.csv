In the ever-evolving world of electronics, devices are becoming increasingly complex, performing a multitude of functions that require advanced engineering and design. However, this complexity can lead to performance and safety issues such as overheating and microwave emissions, which may result in health concerns and reduced device efficiency. To tackle these challenges, a team of Chinese scientists from Beijing Normal University and the University of Science and Technology Beijing has developed multifunctional composite phase change materials (PCMs) to improve thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption in electronic devices.

The researchers drew inspiration from biological systems to create a neural network-like aerogel, increasing the efficiency of thermal management and microwave absorption. Aerogels are unique, low-density materials with high porosity, making them ideal for thermal insulation and energy absorption applications. By combining the aerogel with PCMs, the team engineered a high-performance, multifunctional material tailored for electronic device protection.

To ensure the material's effectiveness, the researchers carefully selected elements to improve thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption. Thermally enhanced PCMs can store and release substantial energy as latent heat, optimizing heat dissipation and storage. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a promising solar-thermal material due to its biodegradability, low cost, high purity, renewability, and easy modification. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been identified as exceptional microwave absorption materials because of their high porosity, adjustable pore structure, and large specific surface area.

The team combined these elements and encased the composite in paraffin wax for thermal storage. After fabrication, the aerogel-based composite PCMs were tested for solar-thermal conversion, thermal storage capacity, and microwave absorption. The results showed an impressive 90% absorption of broadband and full light spectrum for solar-thermal conversion, converting solar energy into thermal energy with greater than 95% efficiency. The thermal storage capacity was measured at 122.19 J/g, and microwave absorption tests revealed efficient absorption of incident electromagnetic waves.

Introduction

In an unexpected turn of events, the world of video gaming has become a fertile ground for software engineering insights. Specifically, experts are now looking at the practices of speedrunners - those who exploit glitches in games to complete them quickly - to understand and enhance software resilience. A team of researchers from the University of Bristol has taken the lead in this unconventional approach, focusing on classic Super Mario games and their respective glitches.

The Study: Super Mario and its Glitches

Nintendo's Super Mario series is iconic, with the earliest platforming games being Super Mario Bros (1985), Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988), Super Mario World (1990), and Super Mario 64 (1996). These games, while older, still hold a strong following among speedrunners who continuously break records. The Bristol team studied these games to identify and classify their glitches, which totaled 237.

The Challenges of Early Gaming Systems

Many early video games were created for consoles with unique hardware, unlike the more standardized PC-like systems of today. This led to aggressive optimization techniques and tricks to make games run smoothly despite limited memory and buses. These techniques, such as memory mapping on the NES, often result in bugs due to their niche nature and differences from typical programming expectations.

New Categories of Weaknesses

The team identified seven new categories of weaknesses, which were previously unspecified in existing software defect taxonomies. This discovery suggests that there may be new kinds of bugs to look for in more general software.

The Intersection of Speedrunning and Software Engineering

Speedrunners' glitches do not always fit neatly into existing software weakness categories. By thematically analyzing these glitches using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) - a qualitative research method for complex phenomena - the team uncovered new insights. The symbiotic relationship between speedrunning and software engineering is that academia can better understand and learn from speedrunners' techniques, potentially leading to more robust software.

The world is rapidly moving towards a circular economy, where waste is minimized, and resources are reused and recycled. This trend is particularly relevant in the technology sector, where electronic waste (e-waste) contains valuable metals like gold. A team of researchers from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), led by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi, has developed an innovative technology that selectively recovers high-purity gold from complex e-waste using textile materials. This breakthrough could significantly improve the efficiency and sustainability of gold recovery.

Traditional adsorbents for metal recovery are typically granular, which increases their specific surface area and adsorption efficiency. However, these materials can be difficult to control underwater, leading to low recovery rates and potential environmental pollution. Fiber-like materials, on the other hand, are more manageable in water and can be easily adapted to various shapes through weaving processes. These properties make them promising candidates for industrial applications.

The KIST researchers have chemically immobilized alkaline molecules on polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers to enhance both molecular gold recovery performance and structural stability. This amine-containing polymer fiber (ALPF) has a significantly larger surface area, which can improve gold ion adsorption by up to 2.5 times compared to the team's previously developed granular gold adsorption material.

The adsorption performance of the ALPF was tested under various pH levels, contact times, and gold concentrations. The results showed that the ALPF could effectively recover gold ions (Au) from a wide range of concentrations (0.1-1000 mg/L) and various pH values (2-12). The FESEM images and XRD patterns of the ALPF after Au recovery further confirmed the successful adsorption of gold particles on the fiber surface.

The KIST team also compared the gold recovery performance of the ALPF with other adsorbents reported in the literature, classified by their size (nano, micro, and milliscale) or shape (particle and fiber). The results demonstrated that the ALPF adsorbent had a higher maximum adsorption capacity (qm) and a more favorable optimum p",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/extracting-high-purity.jpg,2024-04-23 10:28:43,"Meta Description:

Introduction

In today's digital age, health-monitoring apps play a crucial role in helping people manage chronic diseases and maintain their fitness goals. These apps rely on machine-learning models to analyze user data, but their efficiency is often compromised due to the vast amount of data being transferred between a smartphone and a central server. To address this issue, researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have developed a machine-learning accelerator that enhances security while maintaining computational efficiency.

The Challenge: Balancing Efficiency and Security

Engineers often use hardware accelerators to speed up machine-learning computations and reduce data transfer. However, these accelerators can be vulnerable to attacks, allowing hackers to steal sensitive information. In response to this challenge, the researchers aimed to create a machine-learning accelerator resistant to the two most common types of attacks while ensuring that user data remains private.

The Solution: A Secure Machine-Learning Accelerator

The researchers focused on digital in-memory compute (IMC) chips, which perform computations inside a device's memory, thereby reducing data transfer requirements. To protect against side-channel and bus-probing attacks, the team employed a three-pronged approach:

1. Data Splitting: The researchers split data into random pieces, ensuring that a side-channel attack could never reconstruct the original information.
2. Lightweight Cipher: A lightweight cipher was used to encrypt the model stored in off-chip memory, preventing bus-probing attacks.
3. Physically Unclonable Function (PUF): A unique key was generated directly on the chip using random variations introduced during the manufacturing process, further improving security.

Benefits and Implications

This new machine-learning accelerator offers several benefits, including:

- Strong Security: The chip's design effectively safeguards user data from common types of attacks, ensuring privacy.
- Minimal Performance Impact: The added security features only slightly slow down the device, and they do not affect the accuracy of computations.
- Versatility: This technology could be particularly beneficial for demanding AI applications such as augmented and virtual reality, autonomous driving, and health monitoring.

Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology, social robots are becoming increasingly popular. These are machines designed for people to interact with, much like humans do. However, a group of researchers from Cornell and Indiana University argues that the current focus on design features in social robots is insufficient. Instead, they claim that a broader sociological perspective is necessary to understand what truly makes a robot ""social.""

The Importance of Sociological Factors

Malte Jung, an associate professor of information science at Cornell University, emphasizes the need to look beyond the robot's design and programming. According to Jung, sociality is constructed through interactions between people around the machine. In other words, understanding the social context, human-to-human interactions, and cultural norms involving robots is crucial for creating truly social robots.

Award-Winning Research

This novel approach to human-robot interaction was highlighted in a paper that won the Best Paper award at the Human-Robot Interaction conference. The paper, ""Constructing a Social Life with Robots: Shifting Away From Design Patterns Towards Interaction Ritual Chains,"" challenges the traditional focus on robot design and features. Instead, it advocates for a more comprehensive view that includes the broader social context in which robots are used.

Fieldwork in Tokyo

The research was based on fieldwork conducted by Waki Kamino, a doctoral student in the field of information science and the lead author of the paper. Kamino spent months in Tokyo, immersing herself in its robot-friendly culture. She visited homes, robot stores, cafés, and conventions, and interviewed people about their experiences with robot companions.

Robots as Social Agents in Japan

Kamino discovered that in Japan, manufacturers and robot owners together established new norms for robots as social agents. Companies incorporated familiar designs and organized sponsored events, while owners integrated robots into their everyday interactions and social gatherings. This collaboration between manufacturers and users has resulted in robots becoming an integral part of social rituals, such as coffee dates and birthday parties.

Our planet requires significant efforts to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, especially in heating and cooling buildings. Accounting for approximately a third of the carbon pollution in the United States, this sector presents a critical area for improvement. Bedrock Energy, co-founded by Jocelyn Lai, is working diligently to address this challenge by offering geothermal heating pump installations, primarily targeting large commercial structures.

Geothermal heating and cooling technology has been around for a considerable time, but Bedrock Energy aims to scale and make it more accessible, affordable, and efficient. The company's main focus is on commercial buildings in the Northeast, collaborating with Con Ed to lower power demand. However, the core technology has the potential to drive HVAC systems in various settings.

Bedrock Energy drills up to 2,000 feet below the Earth's surface to harness temperatures that remain relatively constant at around 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. This stable temperature source allows for highly efficient heating and cooling, reducing carbon emissions and energy costs. While currently serving commercial clients, Bedrock Energy plans to expand its offerings to residential customers in the future.

Jocelyn Lai, driven by the increased need for decarbonization-oriented sustainability startups, co-founded Bedrock Energy in 2020. In a recent TechCrunch Found podcast, Lai emphasized the untapped potential of geothermal technology:

""The fact that this technology is about scaling something so cool and so efficient and so beneficial for society, and that there isn't really risk in whether or not it works — it's just about, how do we build technology that makes it more accessible in more buildings, more affordable, more available for many building owners.”

Bedrock Energy's fundraising has been successful, securing an $8.5 million seed round in October 2021, thanks in part to ongoing interest in climate technology.

Tesla investors, bracing for potentially underwhelming Q1 earnings, are adjusting to CEO Elon Musk's renewed focus on autonomous driving technology. As Tesla prepares to report its Q1 2024 earnings after markets close Tuesday, Musk has been pushing harder for autonomous driving advancements on two fronts: marketing its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system and developing a robotaxi.

Tesla's earnings call is scheduled for 5:30 pm ET following the release of the earnings report. The company's shares experienced a brief increase of over 2% ahead of the earnings announcement, but this uptick occurred amid a broader downtrend since early March.

Musk's intensified focus on autonomous driving has resulted in several significant changes. Most notably, Tesla reduced the price of its FSD advanced driver-assistance system to $8,000, down from $12,000, and dropped the monthly subscription fee from $199 to $99. These adjustments aim to encourage FSD adoption and gather more data to enhance the neural networks supporting fuller-scale autonomy. However, Tesla's FSD capabilities still require human supervision, as they can only perform certain driving tasks in cities and on highways.

At the same time, Tesla is investing heavily in autonomous driving technology, which is narrowing its profit margins. The company recently laid off 10% of its workforce to reduce costs for its ""next growth phase,"" as outlined in an email from Musk.

In an unexpected move, Tesla paused development of its $25,000 electric vehicle to focus on a robotaxi, which Musk promised to reveal in August. This sudden shift in priorities has resulted in internal reorganizations, highlighting the company's new emphasis on robotaxi development.

These developments are unfolding as Tesla adjusts its EV pricing strategy.

","Title: Harnessing the Power of Biomass for Sustainable Smart Windows

Smart windows, a groundbreaking technology capable of regulating light and heat transmission, offer significant energy-saving potential for large buildings. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to high costs and other factors. A promising solution comes from an unlikely source: corn, potatoes, and beans. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have developed a new type of electrochromic device using sustainable, low-cost materials derived from biomass.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, presents a novel electrochromic device leveraging the dynamic host-guest interactions between iodine and amylose, a natural polymer found in corn, potatoes, and beans. This innovative approach enables the device to modulate light transmission by over 85% and filter ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra using a simple, reusable, transparent electrode.

The new electrochromic system demonstrates remarkable resilience, withstanding more than six weeks of ultraviolet exposure, 1,200 cycles of use, and 4,000 switches between light permeability. This durability, combined with the accessible materials and lack of metal ions or organic solvents, sets the stage for a more affordable and sustainable smart window solution.

The potential impact of this research is significant considering the growing demand for smart glass, encompassing smart windows and displays. According to market estimates, the smart glass industry is projected to reach $12.7 billion by 2030. However, high costs remain a major barrier, with smart windows costing up to ten times more than standard energy-efficient windows.

Smart windows can contribute to energy efficiency by reducing the need for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) in buildings, which account for 39% of energy consumption in the U.S., with 35% attributed to HVAC. By integrating sustainable, low-cost materials into electrochromic devices, researchers are paving the way for widespread smart window adoption, ultimately contributing to greener, more energy-efficient buildings.

A researcher from Virginia Commonwealth University has made a groundbreaking advancement in the field of deception detection. By training a computer to analyze data from a 2002 game show, the researcher has developed a method to predict whether an individual is lying or telling the truth in high-stakes situations.

Dr. Xunyu Chen, an assistant professor in the Department of Information Systems at VCU's School of Business, utilized artificial intelligence methods, such as machine learning and deep learning, to exploit the rich source of deception and trust cues present in human behavior. The study, ""Trust and Deception with High Stakes: Evidence from the 'Friend or Foe' Dataset,"" was published in Decision Support Systems.

Game Shows as a Novel Dataset

Chen and his team utilized a novel dataset from the American game show ""Friend or Foe?"" This show is based on the prisoner's dilemma, a classic game theory that explores how two people could benefit from cooperating or suffer from failing to do so. By analyzing the show's high-stakes deception, the researchers aimed to overcome the limitations of lab experiments, which often lack realism and generalizability.

The Power of High-Stakes Decision-Making

High-stakes deception, as seen in game shows, demands greater cognitive resources for behavioral management compared to low-stakes, fictitious cases. The significant gain or punishment associated with a high-stakes decision may also cause stronger emotional and behavioral variation in cues such as facial expressions, verbal communication, and physical movements.

Multimodal Behavioral Indicators of Deception and Trust

Chen's research led to the discovery of multimodal behavioral indicators of deception and trust in high-stakes decision-making scenarios. These indicators can be used to predict deception with high accuracy, forming the basis of an automated deception detector. This research extends the understanding of deception and trust behaviors that could lead to substantial consequences from a scientific and quantitative perspective.

Artificial intelligence (AI) models that can generate various types of content have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. These developments have opened up new opportunities in filmmaking and data creation for training robotics algorithms. In a paper presented at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024, researchers introduced a novel approach that significantly improves AI's ability to generate videos of human figures in motion based on textual descriptions.

In their previous work, HUMANIZE, the team demonstrated that a two-stage framework could enhance language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. This was achieved by breaking down the task into scene grounding and conditional motion generation. Inspired by the positive impact of affordance on modeling generalization in robotics, the researchers decided to employ scene affordance as an intermediate representation for language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes.

The proposed method, Move as You Say, Interact as You Can: Language-guided Human Motion Generation with Scene Affordance, unfolds in two stages. The first stage involves an Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for affordance map prediction. This model predicts the scene affordance map from the language description. The second stage is the Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM), which generates human motion from the description and pre-produced affordance.

The new framework offers several advantages over previously proposed approaches for language-guided human motion generation. By utilizing scene affordance, the model can:

1. Clearly define the region associated with the user's descriptions/prompts, enhancing its 3D grounding capabilities.
2. Create convincing motions with limited training data.
3. Understand the geometric interplay between scenes and motions, aiding its generalization across diverse scene geometries.

The researchers' primary contribution lies in leveraging explicit scene affordance representation to facilitate language-guided human motion generation in 3D scenes. By integrating scene affordances and representations, this study highlights the potential of conditional motion generation models.
