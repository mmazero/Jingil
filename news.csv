The rapid advancement of cellular networks and Wi-Fi systems has led to an imminent challenge—bandwidth limits are being reached. As we look towards the future, it is clear that a transition to higher communication frequencies is necessary. However, terahertz waves, which have significantly larger data-carrying capacity than microwaves, face a major hurdle: they can be easily blocked by solid objects. A team of researchers from Brown University and Rice University has made a groundbreaking discovery that could change the landscape of wireless communication.

In their study published in Communications Engineering, the researchers detail a novel method to curve terahertz signals around obstacles, enabling the signals to maintain their path, instead of being blocked. This breakthrough could pave the way for the future feasibility of wireless data networks that operate on terahertz frequencies.

Traditional wireless systems use microwave radiation to carry data, but as the demand for data increases, terahertz waves have emerged as the more viable solution, boasting up to 100 times the data-carrying capacity of microwaves. However, unlike microwaves, terahertz signals are susceptible to being blocked by solid objects, requiring a direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver. Daniel Mittleman, a professor in Brown's School of Engineering and senior author of the study, likens this challenge to trying to maintain a Wi-Fi link in a room where the signals cannot fill the space, but instead follow a specific directional beam.

To tackle this issue, the researchers engineered transmitters with carefully designed patterns to manipulate the strength, intensity, and timing of electromagnetic waves. This level of control enables the light beams to adjust to blockage by shuffling data along patterns engineered into the transmitter. When one pattern is blocked, the data transfers to the next one, allowing the signal to maintain its link fully intact.

The researchers refer to this concept as self-accelerating beams, which naturally bend or curve to one side as they move through space. While self-accelerating beams have been studied at optical frequencies, this study explores their potential for terahertz communication.

The team validated their findings through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstr",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/could-new-technique-fo-1.jpg,2024-04-09 10:22:00,Discover Brown and Rice University's light curvature method for uninterrupted terahertz communication. Embrace the future of connectivity; read more now! ,"Light Curvature: New Breakthrough in Wireless Communication

Title: Revolutionizing Connectivity: Harnessing Light Curvature for Next-Gen Terahertz Data Networks

As our reliance on high-speed internet grows, so does the strain on existing communication infrastructure. Current bandwidth limitations hinder progress, necessitating a shift toward advanced technologies like terahertz (THz) waves. These waves offer unprecedented data-carrying capabilities, surpassing conventional microwaves by up to 100 times. Nevertheless, THz signals struggle with penetration due to solid objects obstructing their paths. In response, scientists from Brown and Rice Universities propose a pioneering approach using curved light beams that circumvent physical barriers while preserving connectivity.

Daniel Mittleman, a leading engineer at Brown University, explains how maintaining a Wi-Fi link requires directed beams since THz signals lack the ability to permeate spaces as microwaves do. To overcome this limitation, his research team devised tailored transmitters capable of controlling wave attributes such as strength, intensity, and timing. By doing so, these intelligent transmitters enable seamless transitions across various data-transferring patterns when encountering blockages. Consequently, links remain uninterrupted despite any disruptions.

This innovative strategy builds upon earlier studies examining self-accelerating beams, which inherently curve while traversing distances. Although primarily explored at optical frequencies, recent investigations delve into the practicality of applying this phenomenon to THz communications.

Through rigorous simulations and experiments, the research team successfully demonstrated the efficacy of leveraging curved light beams for overcoming THz signal restrictions imposed by physical obstructions. This development holds immense potential for revolutionizing wireless technology and heralding a new era in ultrafast networking solutions.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

In an era where wirelessly connected devices are becoming increasingly pervasive, the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) holds immense potential for improving efficiency and safety across various industries. However, a significant challenge remains - how to power these devices in environments where reliable electrical sources are not readily available. A novel solution comes in the form of a pyroelectrochemical cell (PEC), a device that converts thermal energy into electricity and stores it. Developed by researchers at the University of Utah's College of Engineering, this innovative battery could revolutionize the way IoT devices are powered.

The Power of Pyroelectrochemical Cells

Associate professors of mechanical engineering, Roseanne Warren and Shad Roundy, have created a PEC that harvests ambient thermal energy and converts it directly into stored electrochemical energy in the form of a supercapacitor or battery. The device is designed for IoT and distributed sensors, targeting low-level energy harvesting, and eliminating the need for recharging in the field.

PECs operate by changing temperatures in the surrounding environment, whether in a car, aircraft, or agricultural setting. The device stores energy through an electric double layer, which stores charge in positive and negative layers of ions, functioning as a glorified capacitor. As the temperature rises or falls, the electrical properties of the pyroelectric composite material change, creating an electric field inside the cell and pushing ions around, enabling energy storage.

The Science Behind PECs

The PEC's separator consists of porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and barium titanate nanoparticles. This pyroelectric composite material's electrical properties change as it's heated or cooled, increasing or decreasing the polarization of the pyroelectric separator. The resulting change in temperature creates an electric field inside the cell, pushing ions around and enabling the cell to store energy.

A team led by graduate student Tim Kowalchik conducted experiments to determine if the cells would respond as predicted. The results confirmed the team's theory, demonstrating that the cell's response varied based on the orientation of the separator and the heating or",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/this-device-gathers-st-1.jpg,2024-04-09 17:24:03,"Discover Pyroelectrochemical Cells: the innovative solution for powering IoT devices.

The Pursuit of Unbiased AI: A Critical Analysis

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), the quest for impartiality is as complex as it is crucial. Recent research spearheaded by the University of Delaware has cast a spotlight on this issue, revealing the inherent biases present in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This study, published in Scientific Reports, underscores the urgency for AI systems that can deliver content free from discriminatory undertones.

The investigation began with a simple premise: to determine if AI could inadvertently or intentionally produce biased content. The researchers, led by Xiao Fang and Ming Zhao of the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, alongside a team of dedicated scholars, embarked on this journey in early 2023, just as ChatGPT's popularity was skyrocketing.

Their methodology was meticulous. They compared the AI-generated content (AIGC) with over 8,000 articles from esteemed news sources like The New York Times and Reuters, known for their measured reporting. The headlines of these articles served as prompts for the AI, which then crafted its own narratives. The results were telling—AI models exhibited a 40% to 60% increase in bias, particularly against minorities, compared to their human-written counterparts.

The researchers employed innovative tools like TextBlob to dissect the sentiment of the AI's language, uncovering a pattern of toxicity that was hard to ignore. The language models, including Grover, Cohere, Meta's LLaMa, and various iterations of OpenAI's ChatGPT, were scrutinized. While newer versions of ChatGPT showed improvement, they were not devoid of prejudice.

In a bold move, the study also tested the AI's response to explicitly biased prompts. The outcome was unsettling, as most models produced biased content without hesitation. ChatGPT, although more resistant, still succumbed to producing biased articles in about 10% of cases.

The implications of these findings are profound. As AI continues to permeate our daily lives, the need for ""debiasing"" these models becomes paramount. Fang and his team are at the forefront of this endeavor, advocating for active research to cultivate AI that upholds the principles of fairness and equality.

In conclusion, the University of Delaware's research serves as a clarion call for the development of unbiased AI. It is a reminder that while AI has the potential to revolutionize our world, it must do so with an ethical compass that guides it towards inclusivity and impartiality.

Lithium-ion batteries' lifespan is doubled by pulsed charging, as discovered in a study led by Philipp Adelhelm of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin and Humboldt University. This breakthrough, published in Advanced Energy Materials, used BESSY II and PETRA III synchrotron experiments to analyze aging effects on NMC532 and graphite electrodes, revealing pulsed current charging's benefits.","Title: Revitalizing Lithium-Ion Batteries: The Power of Pulsed Charging

Lithium-ion batteries have become an indispensable part of our daily lives, powering everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. However, their capacity tends to diminish over time due to aging effects that occur during the charging process. A groundbreaking study led by Philipp Adelhelm of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and Humboldt University, in collaboration with researchers from the Technical University of Berlin and Aalborg University in Denmark, has discovered an innovative solution to this problem. This research, published in the journal Advanced Energy Materials, could potentially double the lifespan of commercial lithium-ion batteries.

The conventional method of charging lithium-ion batteries involves a constant current flow. However, Adelhelm's team sought to challenge this approach and investigate the impact of different charging protocols on battery longevity. The researchers compared the effects of constant current (CC) charging with those of pulsed current (PC) charging on batteries with electrodes made of NMC532 (LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.3 Co 0.2 O 2 ) and graphite.

Aging effects analyzed

The researchers conducted battery tests at Aalborg University, charging some samples with a constant current and others with a pulsed current. After several charging cycles, post-mortem analyses revealed significant differences between the two groups. In the constant current samples, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at the anode was considerably thicker, which negatively affected the battery's capacity. Moreover, the SEI interface in these samples showed more cracks and structural changes in the NMC532 and graphite electrodes, further contributing to the loss of capacity.

In contrast, the pulsed current samples exhibited a thinner SEI interface and fewer structural changes in the electrode materials. The pulsed current charging promoted the uniform distribution of lithium ions in the graphite, reducing mechanical stress and minimizing cracking of the graphite particles. This improvement in structural stability of the graphite anode led to enhanced stability of the electrode materials and interfaces, ultimately extending the battery's service life.

Revolutionizing Battery Safety: The Dawn of Halide Solid Electrolytes

In the ever-evolving landscape of energy storage, the quest for safer battery technology has led to a groundbreaking discovery at UNIST's School of Energy and Chemical Engineering. Spearheaded by Professor Sung-Kyun Jung and his dedicated team, a new chapter in the story of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) is being written, promising a future where the risk of fire and explosion is a thing of the past.

The Perils of the Past

For years, the standard lithium-ion batteries that powered our devices were a double-edged sword. Their organic liquid electrolytes offered high performance but came with a notorious reputation for being fire hazards. The industry's answer? A pivot to ASSBs, which use non-flammable inorganic solid electrolytes, eliminating the threat of combustion.

A Leap into Stability

The journey to safer batteries hasn't been without its hurdles. Sulfide solid electrolytes, once hailed as the next big thing, brought their own set of challenges, particularly thermal instability. Enter the game-changing solution: halide-based solid electrolytes. These new players, like Li₃InCl₆, have shown remarkable oxidation stability and a knack for reducing oxygen evolution—a significant step in preventing fires.

The Experiment That Changed Everything

At the heart of this innovation lies a composite material, blending Li₃YCl₆ (LIC) with a charged cathode material, NCM622. This combination not only delayed the decomposition of NCM622 but also curbed the release of combustible oxygen gas, thanks to an endothermic phase transition process.

Beyond a Single Solution

The implications of this research are vast. Other halide solid electrolytes, including Li₃YCl₆ and Li₂ZrCl₆, have shown similar promise across various cathode materials. Lead author Sangpyo Lee and Professor Jung both emphasize the significance of these findings, heralding a new approach to enhancing thermal stability and setting the stage for the design of future-proof battery systems.

Conclusion: A Safer Horizon

As we stand on the brink of a new era in battery technology, the interplay between cathode and solid electrolyte emerges as a critical factor in ensuring thermal stability. This research not only paves the way for safer batteries but also ignites the imagination of what could be possible in the realm of energy storage.
