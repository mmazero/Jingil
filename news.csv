However, with the current systems in place, many organizations are struggling to keep up with the latest trends. As a result, a new wave of IT modernization is underway, with renewed pushes to move from on-premises systems to hybrid or multicloud services.

According to a survey of 1,500 IT executives commissioned by Nutanix, adoption of hybrid and multicloud clouds is expected to double over the next one to three years. The reasons for this shift are diverse, ranging from AI and edge systems to security and sustainability. Nearly four in ten respondents, 37%, say running AI applications on their current IT infrastructure will be a ""significant"" challenge.

The priority for many IT executives is to increase investments in AI, which they have identified as their first-ranked priority for the year. Right behind AI on the priority list is IT modernization, which means more cloud. These two priorities go hand in hand, with AI propelling the new wave of IT infrastructure modernization.

One of the challenges of modernization efforts is the need to upgrade AI applications or infrastructure to support the transfer of data between cloud, data center, and edge environments. Nearly all respondents, 99%, say they plan to upgrade their AI applications or infrastructure, with more than half saying they need to improve the transfer of data between these environments.

Many industry leaders concur that AI is spurring a range of new investments across the board.

Introduction:

The rise of deepfakes has sparked a growing concern about the potential misuse of technology. In response, OpenAI is refining its voice cloning capabilities through the development of Voice Engine. This innovative tool allows users to upload any 15-second voice sample and generate a synthetic copy of that voice. However, the public availability of Voice Engine has not yet been announced, giving OpenAI time to address any ethical concerns and ensure the responsible use of this powerful technology.

Body:

OpenAI’s Voice Engine is the latest expansion of the company’s existing text-to-speech API. The model has been under development for about two years and was trained on a mix of licensed and publicly available data. This includes speech recordings sourced from public sites and data sets around the web. While generative AI vendors often keep training data details secret, OpenAI has licensing agreements with some content providers, such as Shutterstock and Axel Springer, and allows webmasters to block its web crawler from scraping their site for training data. However, OpenAI does not offer an opt-out scheme for its other products.

Training the Model

The generative AI model powering Voice Engine is the same model that underpins the voice and “read aloud” capabilities in ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, as well as the preset voices available in OpenAI’s text-to-speech API. Spotify has also been using this model since early September to dub podcasts for high-profile hosts like Lex Fridman in different languages.

The Voice Engine model was trained on an enormous number of examples, usually sourced from public sites and data sets around the web. Many generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info pertaining to it close to the chest. However, training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much.

OpenAI has faced legal challenges over allegations that the company violated IP law by training its AI on copyrighted content, including photos, artwork, code, articles, and e-books, without providing the creators or owners credit or pay.

The Fall of a Crypto Giant: Sam Bankman-Fried's 25-Year Sentence

In a landmark ruling that sent shockwaves through the world of cryptocurrency, New York's Southern District Court today handed down a 25-year prison sentence to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan announced the decision, which was met with a mixture of relief and disbelief from those in the industry.

At the hearing, Bankman-Fried expressed his regret for his actions and the harm they caused. ""It's been excruciating to watch,"" he said. ""Customers don't deserve any of that pain."" He also acknowledged the serious time he was likely to spend behind bars. ""My useful life is probably over,"" he said. ""It's been over for a while now.""

Judge Kaplan explained his reasoning for delivering such a harsh sentence to the one-time golden boy of the crypto community, suggesting that Bankman-Fried could be in ""position to do something very bad in the future."" The sentence was issued ""for the purpose of disabling him to the extend that can appropriately be done for a significant period of time.""

Sam Bankman-Fried, now known as SBF, was arrested in the Bahamas in December of 2022 and faced seven charges, including wire fraud against FTX customers, wire fraud against Alameda Research lenders, conspiracy to commit wire fraud against both entities, conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud on FTX customers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was found guilty of all charges.

The trial, which lasted one month, was a gripping and emotional affair. Prosecutors argued that SBF used FTX funds to keep sibling company Alameda Research afloat, while SBF's defense team tried to portray him as a hapless math nerd who was wrestling with forces largely outside of his control.

Alameda borrowed more than $8 billion from FTX, money that was taken from accounts belonging to FTX customers. SBF claims he only learned of this in 2020 but performed no actions to safeguard the funds. He took the stand during the trial and said that he deeply regrets ""not taking a deeper look into"" what was going on with both companies.

FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in 2022, leaving many customers and investors out of pocket. The trial, which was closely watched by the industry, was a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency.

As SBF prepares to appeal the decision, the crypto community remains divided, with some feeling vindicated by the outcome, while others are questioning the fairness of the sentence. Regardless of what happens next, the case of Sam Bankman-Fried serves as a cautionary tale for those in the industry.

In conclusion, the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried marks a significant moment in the history of cryptocurrency. The case highlights the importance of due diligence, risk management, and ethical behavior in the industry. While the outcome may be a disappointment for some, it serves as a reminder that the crypto world is not immune to the consequences of bad behavior.

Although SBF's sentence may be harsh, it is a necessary step to ensure that the industry remains safe and secure for all parties involved. As the crypto world continues to evolve, it is critical that we continue to learn from the mistakes of the past and strive to build a better future for all.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have garnered immense attention for their ability to write papers, answer questions, and even solve math problems. However, these models suffer from one significant flaw: accuracy. Every result obtained by an LLM must be manually checked to ensure it's correct, which reduces their value significantly.

To address this issue, a team of artificial intelligence specialists at Google's DeepMind has developed an AI-based system called SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator). This new system can automatically check the results of answers given by LLMs and highlight inaccuracies.

One of the primary ways human users of LLMs fact-check results is by investigating AI responses using a search engine like Google to find appropriate sources for verification. SAFE takes a similar approach. It creates an LLM that breaks down claims or facts in an answer provided by the original LLM and then uses Google Search to find sites that could be used for verification. The system compares the two answers to determine accuracy.

To test the system's efficacy, the research team used it to verify approximately 16,000 facts contained in answers given by several LLMs. They found that SAFE matched the findings of human (crowdsourced) fact-checkers 72% of the time. When testing disagreements between SAFE and human checkers, the researchers found SAFE to be correct 76% of the time.

DeepMind has made the code for SAFE available for anyone to use on their open-source site, GitHub. This move allows anyone to take advantage of the system's capabilities and improve the accuracy of LLMs, leading to more valuable and reliable results.

In conclusion, DeepMind's new AI-based system, SAFE, can significantly improve the accuracy of large language models by automatically fact-checking results. By making the code available for anyone to use, the system can help democratize the use of accurate LLMs, benefiting individuals and organizations alike.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2020/google.jpg,2024-03-29 09:32:00,"""Fact-checking AI system""Title: DeepMind's New AI System for Fact-Checking Large Language Models

Introduction:
As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, the threats of AI-powered deepfakes are becoming more prevalent. These deepfakes can be used to manipulate people's perceptions and beliefs, leading to dangerous consequences. In this article, we will discuss the risks of voice cloning and how to safeguard your voice from deepfakes.

Body:

1. Voice Cloning:
OpenAI's voice-cloning tool, ""Voice Engine,"" is capable of reproducing someone's speech based on a mere 15-second audio sample. This technology has serious risks, especially in an election year when disinformation campaigns are rampant. Disinformation researchers fear that AI-powered deepfakes could be used to manipulate voters and sway public opinion.

2. Risks of Deepfakes:
The proliferation of deepfakes poses a significant threat to democracy and the integrity of elections. Deepfakes can be used to impersonate prominent figures, spread fake news, and manipulate public opinion. The use of deepfakes can also lead to distrust in institutions and erode the credibility of information sources.

3. Safeguarding Your Voice:
To safeguard your voice from deepfakes, it's essential to be aware of the risks and take proactive measures. One way to do this is to ensure that any audio created using Voice Engine is clearly labeled as a deepfake. This labeling can help to prevent people from falling victim to deepfake disinformation.

4. Informed Consent:
When using Voice Engine, it's crucial to obtain explicit and informed consent from any person whose voice is duplicated. This consent should be given voluntarily, and the person should be fully informed about the implications of their voice being used in a deepfake.

5. Watermarking:
OpenAI has implemented a set of safety measures, including watermarking, to trace the origin of any audio generated by Voice Engine. Watermarking can help to identify deepfakes and prevent their spread.

Conclusion:

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/this-week-in-ai-let-us-not-forget-the-humble-data-annotator/,This Week in AI: Let us not forget the humble data annotator,"""Labeling and Annotation in AI: Addressing Ethical Concerns""","

Keeping up with the fast-paced world of AI requires a constant watchful eye. This week, we will be taking a closer look at labeling and annotation startups, which are essential for the development of modern AI models. Labeling involves adding tags or markings to data to help the model understand and interpret the information during the training process. The accuracy and quality of labels significantly impact the performance and reliability of the trained models. Annotation is a massive undertaking, requiring thousands to millions of labels for larger and more sophisticated data sets.

Unfortunately, many annotators in these startups are not treated well. They are often paid low wages, work long hours, and do not have access to the same benefits as the engineers building the models. Some annotators are even exposed to highly disturbing content without receiving breaks or mental health resources.

A recent piece in NY Mag highlights Scale AI, which recruits annotators from countries such as Nairobi and Kenya. This platform requires its workers to complete multiple eight-hour workdays without breaks and pays as little as $10. The workers are also subject to the whims of the platform, with some annotators going long stretches without receiving work or being suddenly booted off the platform without notice.

Some annotation and labeling platforms claim to provide fair-trade work, but there are no regulations, and industry standards for what ethical labeling work means vary widely. The only hope for change is through policymaking, which is a challenging prospect but necessary to ensure that the workers in the industry are treated fairly and humanely.

In other AI news, researchers are working to improve weather forecasting using machine learning. MetNet-3 and GraphCast have developed a new system called SEEDS (Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler), which uses diffusion to generate plausible weather outcomes for an area based on input data. This system is faster than physics-based models and can cover more edge cases, making it more confident about more likely situations.

Fujitsu is also working to better understand the natural world by applying AI image handling techniques to underwater imagery and lidar data collected by underwater autonomous vehicles. Improving the quality of the imagery will allow other less sophisticated processes to work better on the target data, leading to the development of a digital twin that can simulate and predict new developments.

Finally, researchers have found that LLMs (Language Models) mimic intelligence using a much simpler than expected method: linear functions. While these models are highly complex and difficult to understand, there are simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one example of how even the most sophisticated models can have basic elements that contribute to their functionality.

In conclusion, labeling and annotation startups are essential for the development of modern AI models. While some companies have built their reputations on using third-world annotators paid low wages, the need for fair treatment and human rights for these workers must be addressed. By policymaking and promoting ethical labeling work, we can ensure that the workers in the industry are treated fairly and humanely.

Other AI news includes improvements in weather forecasting, the development of a digital twin for ocean exploration, and the discovery that LLMs mimic intelligence using linear functions. These advancements in AI technology are paving the way for a future where machines can understand and interpret the world around us more accurately and efficiently.

Transformers have been the talk of the town in the generative AI landscape since their inception in 2017. However, AI21 Labs is challenging the status quo with a new approach called ""Jamba."" Jamba combines the Mamba model, based on the Structured State Space model (SSM), with a transformer architecture to create an optimized gen AI model.

While Jamba may not replace current transformer-based large language models (LLM) today, it will likely be a supplement in certain areas. According to AI21 Labs, Jamba outperforms traditional transformer-based models on generative reasoning tasks as measured by benchmarks such as HellaSwag. However, it currently does not outperform transformer-based models on other critical benchmarks such as the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) for problem-solving.

Jamba isn't just a new Jurassic take from AI21 Labs. The company has a particular focus on gen AI for enterprise use cases. In fact, AI21 Labs raised $155 million in Aug. 2023 to support its growing efforts.

The company's enterprise tools include Wordtune, an optimized service that helps enterprises generate content that matches an organization's tone and brand. AI21 Labs often competes and directly wins against gen AI giant OpenAI for enterprise business.

Jamba is not an evolution of Jurassic, it's something quite different as a hybrid SSM and transformer model. The attention mechanism scales with sequence length and slows down throughput in transformers, making them less efficient for long context use cases. The Mamba SSM architecture, on the other hand, provides resource optimization and a different attention mechanism to handle large context windows.

Jamba uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, which allows for an extreme level of optimization. Specifically, Jamba's MoE layers allow it to draw on just 12B of its available 52B parameters at inference, making those 12B active parameters more efficient than a Transformer-only model of equivalent size.

While Jamba is still in the early stages of development, it holds great potential for the future of generative AI. AI21 Labs plans to offer an instruct version on the AI21 Platform as a beta soon.

The company took action after it was informed by TechCrunch that the data contained encrypted passcodes that could be used to access customer accounts. The security researcher who analyzed the data found that the encrypted account passcodes are easy to decipher.

AT&T has acknowledged that the leaked data belongs to its customers, three years after a hacker claimed the theft of 73 million AT&T customer records. The company denied a breach of its systems at the time, but the source of the leak remains inconclusive. It is not yet known whether the data in those fields originated from AT&T or one of its vendors.

In 2021, the hacker claiming the AT&T breach posted only a small sample of records, making it difficult to verify the authenticity of the data. Earlier in March, a data seller published the full 73 million alleged AT&T records online on a known cybercrime forum, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the leaked records. AT&T customers have since confirmed that their leaked account data is accurate.

The leaked data includes AT&T customer names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. Each record in the leaked data contains the AT&T customer’s account passcode in an encrypted format. The security researcher who analyzed the data confirmed this by looking up records in the leaked data against AT&T account passcodes known only to them.

The data breach has raised concerns about the security of customer information held by large telecommunications companies. It is essential for companies to take proactive steps to protect their customers’ data and prevent data breaches from occurring.

In conclusion, AT&T has taken action to reset customer account passcodes after a massive data leak containing their customer records was made public online.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/mineos-aims-to-illuminate-the-ai-black-box-for-enterprise/,MineOS aims to illuminate the AI 'black box' for enterprise," ""Revolutionize AI Governance with MineOS"" ","In the ever-evolving landscape of security workforce, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force. With the launch of its new AI Asset Discovery and Risk Assessment module, MineOS is set to revolutionize the way companies govern these opaque technologies. In this blog post, we’ll explore the vision, benefits, and use cases of AI for security teams, the challenges of AI governance, and how MineOS is illuminating the AI “black box” for enterprises worldwide.

The Rise of AI Governance

With the advent of powerful AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini, the need for oversight has become increasingly apparent. AI governance has been a top priority in the tech world, and this trend is expected to continue as regulations like the EU’s AI Act impose new assessment requirements. However, creating and implementing controls remains a challenge for many companies.

The Problem of AI Opaqueness

One of the key challenges facing AI governance is the opacity of these systems. AI systems like large language models (LLMs) can provide tremendous benefits, but their inner workings are often invisible to users. This lack of transparency has led to growing concerns around potential harms related to security, ethics, privacy, and more.

The AI Governance Gap

While frameworks and solutions for enterprises to effectively govern AI development and usage have been slow to arrive, MineOS is determined to bridge this gap. The company’s new AI Asset Discovery and Risk Assessment module offers a comprehensive solution to help companies gain visibility into their AI systems and ensure compliance with emerging regulations.

How MineOS Works

MineOS uses a combination of system scans and analysis of email metadata to detect nearly all data systems and AI tools used within an organization, both third-party and internally developed. This allows companies to map their AI landscapes and comply with emerging regulations. The email discovery investigates the metadata of emails looking for things like invoices and sign-up notifications to detect additional data systems. If an employee is using ChatGPT or Grammarly or another AI-powered system, there’ll be that email trace of it, and MineOS can confirm that without looking at the content of the emails themselves.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-optimization-based-method-autonomous.html,An optimization-based method to enhance autonomous parking,Optimization-based method enhances autonomous parking planner,"

Autonomous vehicles are a dream come true for both robotics researchers and the automotive industry. However, despite the efforts of various companies and the limited testing of these vehicles, they have only been deployed in a restricted number of settings. One such application of autonomous driving that has garnered significant research interest is ""automated valet parking"" (AVP). However, the reliable realization of this autonomous driving function has so far proven challenging.

Recently, researchers at Mach Drive in Shanghai have successfully developed OCEAN, an Openspace Collision-freE trAjectory plaNner for autonomous parking. The planner, which was introduced in a pre-published paper on arXiv, was found to enhance the ability of cars to safely reach a parking spot without colliding with objects on the way.

OCEAN is an optimization-based trajectory planner that builds on the previously introduced approach called Hybrid Optimization-based Collision Avoidance (H-OBCA). Its primary limitations, such as the inability to accurately predict collisions and poor performance in real-time tests, have been addressed.

The planner's improved design ultimately improves its ability to avoid collisions, along with its robustness and speed in real time. The researchers tested OCEAN on hundreds of simulated scenarios and conducted real-world experiments in public parking areas. The results were highly promising, as OCEAN was found to outperform a variety of methods for autonomous parking applications.

The OCEAN planner could be further improved and tested in additional real-world trials. In the future, it could be deployed by automotive companies, contributing to the introduction of automated vehicle parking technologies. The success of OCEAN planner will pave the way for the widespread adoption of autonomous driving for parking.

This is where Space and Time's innovative solution comes in. As CTO and co-founder of Space and Time, Scott Dykstra believes that zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) are the key to solving this problem.

ZK proofs are cryptographic actions that can be used to prove something about a piece of information without revealing the origin data itself. This makes them ideal for verifying data and preventing manipulation, especially in industries where there is an incentive to manipulate records.

Space and Time is already indexing data on major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and more, but Dykstra sees the potential for this technology to expand beyond the blockchain industry. He believes that a decentralized, globally available database is needed to ensure the integrity of AI data and prevent manipulation.

One of Dykstra's biggest concerns is the lack of verifiability in AI data. He believes that there is a need for a decentralized database to ensure that AI models are executed correctly and that their outputs can be verified.

To achieve this, Dykstra is working on building ZK proofs for machine learning and large language models. However, he knows that this will take time, and it may be years before these proofs are widely available.

Dykstra believes that the future of AI and blockchain technology requires a decentralized and globally available database that can be created through blockchains. This database should be operated by the community and be readily available and uncensorable.

In conclusion, Space and Time's solution offers a promising solution to the growing need for transparency and verification of data in the world of AI. With ZK proofs, it is possible to ensure that data is correct and prevent manipulation, even in industries where there is an incentive to do so. As the world of AI continues to evolve, it is clear that decentralized databases will be an essential component of its future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1828490321.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 17:00:55,"Space and Time offers a solution to the growing need for transparency and verification of data in the world of AI through zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs).

https://www.engadget.com/how-uber-and-the-gig-economy-changed-the-way-we-live-and-work-164528738.html,How Uber and the gig economy changed the way we live and work, Gig economy and Uber impact on taxi industry and labor market: challenges and visions ,"The gig economy has exploded in recent years, fueled by advances in technology and financial anxiety. Companies like Uber have capitalized on this trend by offering ad-hoc services to anyone with a smartphone. However, Uber's success has come at a cost, as the company has faced numerous legal and ethical challenges, including allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

One of the casualties of the gig economy has been the traditional taxi industry. As ride-sharing services like Uber have gained popularity, the value of taxi medallions has plummeted, leaving many drivers struggling to pay off loans they took out to buy their medallions. In response, some jurisdictions have attempted to offset the decline in medallion value by compensating cab drivers, while others have applied a per-ride fee to ride-sharing services.

Compensation for ride-sharing drivers has also dried up. In 2017, Uber settled allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it used false promises about potential earnings to entice drivers to join its platform. Late last year, Uber and Lyft agreed to pay $328 million to New York drivers after the state conducted a wage theft investigation. Many rideshare drivers have also sought recognition as employees rather than contractors, so they can have a consistent hourly wage, overtime pay, and benefits.

Despite these challenges, Uber's founder, Travis Kalanick, had a grand vision for the company. In 2014, he announced plans to replace human drivers with self-driving vehicles and flying taxis. ""The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car—you're paying for the other dude in the car,"" Kalanick said at the time. ""When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. So the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away.""

However, Uber's plans for a driverless future have faced numerous challenges, including technical difficulties and regulatory hurdles. The company has also faced criticism for its treatment of drivers, including allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-elastic-strain.html,A first-ever complete map for elastic strain engineering," ""Complete Map for Elastic Strain Engineering: Tune Crystalline Materials to Produce Specific Properties"" ","Title: The Power of Elastic Strain Engineering: Tune Crystalline Materials to Produce Specific Properties

Are you tired of feeling like you're wandering through the world of materials properties without a clear sense of direction? Do you want to know where you're headed and how to get there? The answer lies in the map, a graphical representation that plots the stability regions of a crystal as a function of strain. With this map, scientists and engineers can determine the conditions under which a material can exist in a particular phase and when it might fail or transition to another phase.

For decades, we've known that while bulk materials behave in certain ways, those rules can break down for materials at the micro- and nano-scales, and often in surprising ways. One of those surprises was the finding that, for some materials, applying even modest strains on materials can dramatically improve certain properties, provided those strains stay elastic and do not relax away by plasticity, fracture, or phase transformations. Micro- and nano-scale materials are especially good at holding applied strains in the elastic form.

The question has always been, how can we apply these elastic strains (or equivalently, residual stress) to achieve certain material properties? Recently, a team of MIT researchers has developed the first-ever map of how to tune crystalline materials to produce specific thermal and electronic properties. This map was created using a combination of first principles calculations and machine learning, and it delineates the complete six-dimensional boundary of ideal strength, which is the upper limit to elastic strain engineering.

Using this approach, we can now explore many other materials. Traditionally, people create new materials by changing the chemistry. However, with a ternary alloy, you can change the percentage of two elements, so you have two degrees of freedom. What our work shows is that diamond, with just one element, is equivalent to a six-component alloy, because you have six degrees of elastic strain freedom you can tune independently.

This research builds on a foundation laid as far back as the 1980s, when researchers first discovered that the performance of semiconductor materials doubled when a small—just 1 percent—elastic strain was applied to the material.

And while the applications for elastic strain engineering are numerous, one of the most promising is in high-temperature applications.

Are you curious about Grok, X's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT? Let's dive into the world of Grok and find out what it's all about.

What is Grok?

Grok is a chatbot developed by xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup. It's a cutting-edge AI system that goes beyond what other chatbots can do, thanks to its ability to access real-time X data. This allows Grok to provide up-to-date information about current events, pop culture, and more.

How does Grok work?

Grok is powered by a generative AI model called Grok-1. This model was developed over months on a cluster of ""tens of thousands"" of GPUs, according to an xAI blog post. To train it, xAI sourced data from the web (dated up to Q3 2023) and from feedback from human assistants that xAI refers to as ""AI tutors.""

Grok-1 is capable of performing about as well as Meta's open source Llama 2 chatbot model and surpasses OpenAI's GPT-3.5, xAI claims. While most AI-powered chatbots are fine-tuned using ""reinforcement learning from human feedback"" (RLHF), Grok's internet-browsing capabilities allow it to search the web for up-to-date information about topics.

Grok's biggest selling point is its ability to access real-time X data, which no other chatbots can do. This allows it to provide highly accurate and up-to-date information about current events, pop culture, and more.

How do I access Grok?

To access Grok, you need to have an X account. You'll also need to fork over $16 per month or $168 per year for an X Premium+ plan. X Premium+ is the highest-priced subscription on X, as it removes all the ads in the For You and Following feeds. In addition, Premium+ introduces a hub where users can get paid to post and offer fans subscriptions, and Premium+ users have their replies boosted the most in X'","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1771536851.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-29 13:00:44,"Meta Description: Discover Elon Musk's Grok, the cutting-edge chatbot that accesses real-time X data for up-to-date information.

Navigating the Intersection of AI and Government Security

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) has become a staple in various sectors, its integration into government operations has raised significant security concerns. Recent developments have seen the US Congress take decisive action to mitigate potential risks associated with AI tools on government-issued devices.

The Prohibition of AI Tools on Congressional Devices

A memo from Catherine Szpindor, the House Chief Administrative Officer, has officially prohibited the use of Microsoft's AI chatbot, Copilot, on Congressional devices. This decision stems from concerns raised by the Office of Cybersecurity regarding the potential for sensitive House data to be compromised through non-approved cloud services. While Congressional staff may continue to use Copilot on personal devices, its use on government-issued Windows devices is now blocked.

The ChatGPT Precedent and White House Regulations

This move echoes a similar restriction placed nearly a year prior on the use of ChatGPT, another AI tool powered by OpenAI's language models. The free version of ChatGPT was banned from House computers, though the paid version, ChatGPT Plus, was permitted for continued use under the premise of enhanced privacy controls.

In alignment with these precautions, the White House has introduced guidelines for federal agencies regarding the use of generative AI. These rules are designed to ensure that AI tools do not compromise the rights and safety of American citizens.

Microsoft's Response and Future Roadmap

In response to these security concerns, Microsoft has acknowledged the need for heightened security measures for government users. The tech giant has unveiled a suite of tools and services tailored for government applications, including an Azure OpenAI service for classified workloads and an updated version of the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant. These offerings promise enhanced security features, aiming to make them more suitable for managing sensitive information.

As the government version of Copilot awaits release, Szpindor's office plans to conduct a thorough evaluation to determine its suitability for use on House devices.

Conclusion

The balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and ensuring national security is delicate. As AI continues to evolve, so too must the measures to protect the integrity of government operations. The steps taken by the US Congress and the proactive approach of Microsoft highlight the ongoing efforts to navigate this complex landscape.
