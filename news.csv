In our modern world, electronic devices are becoming increasingly complex, boasting an array of functions that make our lives more convenient. However, this growing complexity can lead to performance and safety issues, such as overheating and the emission of microwaves that may affect human health and hinder a device's performance.

Researchers from Beijing Normal University have developed a groundbreaking solution to these challenges by creating a shield for electronic devices using multifunctional composite phase change materials (PCMs). These man-made materials are engineered by combining various elements to produce a new material with specific characteristics tailored to improve thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption in electronic devices.

The researchers drew inspiration from biological systems to build a neural network-like aerogel, significantly enhancing thermal management and microwave emission absorption. This innovative material provides a promising application for highly integrated and miniaturized electronic devices in complex and ever-changing outdoor environments.

To create the ideal PCM shield, the team carefully selected the elements that would yield the necessary properties for improved thermal management, solar-thermal conversion, and microwave absorption. They chose thermally enhanced PCMs, which can store and release massive amounts of energy as latent heat, ensuring precise temperature control. As the temperature rises, these composites undergo phase change from solid to liquid, increasing the available heat storage. When the temperature cools, the liquid reverts to solid.

Bacterial cellulose (BC) was another essential element in the new aerogel shield. This natural biomass is highly desirable due to its numerous advantages, including biodegradability, low cost, high purity, renewability, easy modification, and functionalization. BC-derived carbon nanofiber, obtained through high-temperature carbonization, is a promising solar-thermal material.

To address the issue of microwave emissions, the researchers turned to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have exceptional porosity, adjustable pore structure, and high specific surface area. MOFs can efficiently absorb microwaves through scattering or multiple reflection. The researchers then encased the material in paraffin wax, which can undergo phase change, for thermal storage.

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Princeton University are paving the way for a new era of immersive displays that seamlessly merge the real and virtual worlds. By utilizing high-definition 3D holographic images, we are one step closer to experiencing truly immersive virtual and augmented reality without the need for bulky headsets or intrusive screens.

Holographic images significantly differ from traditional monitor-based displays, which merely simulate depth on a two-dimensional screen. Since we naturally perceive the world in three dimensions, holographic images can be integrated effortlessly into our everyday view, creating a unique and immersive experience.

Imagine donning a regular pair of glasses equipped with these ultra-thin holographic displays. You would be able to move your head freely without losing sight of the holographic images. Conventional virtual reality displays rely on monitors, which require users to wear bulky headsets and sit close to a large screen for an immersive experience. Holographic displays, however, could revolutionize how we interact with our environment, offering countless applications from driving directions to surgical monitoring and home repair instructions.

The primary challenge in creating high-quality holographic images lies in the spatial light modulator, a small chip-like device responsible for generating these images. Until now, modulators could only create small, clear images or large, fuzzy ones, presenting a tradeoff between image size and clarity. This limitation has resulted in a narrow field of view, insufficient for delivering an immersive experience.

To tackle this challenge, Felix Heide, Nathan Matsuda, and Ethan Tseng have developed a device that enhances image quality and expands the field of view. By building a secondary optical element that works in conjunction with the spatial light modulator, they have created a system that filters light, expanding the field of view while preserving image stability and fidelity. This innovation leads to a larger image with minimal quality reduction, bringing us one step closer to resolving image quality issues that have hindered holographic display practicality.

The global circular economy market is set to more than double, from $338 billion in 2022 to approximately $712 billion in 2026. This growth is partly driven by the increasing adoption of recycling technologies in the semiconductor industry. As resource depletion and rising raw material prices continue to impact metal imports, companies like SK hynix and Samsung Electronics are investing in recycling programs and eco-friendly initiatives.

In this context, a team of researchers from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), led by Dr. Jae-Woo Choi, has developed a groundbreaking technology to selectively recover high-purity gold from complex electronic waste. This new method utilizes textile materials as adsorbents, providing a more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional adsorbents.

Traditional adsorbents for metal recovery are typically granular, with a focus on maximizing specific surface area for increased adsorption efficiency. However, these materials can be difficult to control underwater, resulting in low recovery rates and potential secondary environmental pollution. To address this challenge, KIST researchers turned to fiber-like materials, which are easier to control and can be woven into various shapes.

The team chemically immobilized alkaline molecules on polyacrylonitrile (PANF) fibers to create a high-performance amine-containing polymer fiber (ALPF). This innovative material not only enhances molecular gold recovery performance but also improves structural stability, making it ideal for industrial applications.

The amine-containing polymer fiber exhibits a dramatically larger surface area, which, in turn, significantly improves the adsorption performance of gold ions (Au) in waste by up to 2.5 times (from 576 mg/g to 1,462 mg/g) compared to the team's previously developed granular gold adsorption material. Furthermore, the ALPF's gold recovery performance remains strong under various conditions, such as pH levels and initial concentrations.

Microsoft's compact Phi-3 Mini, offering GPT-3.5 level performance, is now available on Azure. Trained on 3.8B parameters, it's perfect for on-device AI.","Title: The Power of Small but Mighty: Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini Language Model

In the realm of artificial intelligence, tech giants are in constant competition to create increasingly larger and more sophisticated models. However, Microsoft has taken a different approach by focusing on the potential of smaller AI models. Recently, the company introduced Phi-3 Mini, the first in a series of three compact models set to launch in the upcoming months.

Phi-3 Mini was trained on 3.8 billion parameters, making it the smallest model in Microsoft's new lineup. The company plans to release Phi-3 Small, trained on 7 billion parameters, and Phi-3 Medium, trained on 14 billion parameters, in the near future. To put this into perspective, OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo is rumored to have been trained on more than a trillion parameters, while Meta's final Llama 3 model, launching in 2024, will have been trained on 700 billion parameters.

The number of parameters in an AI model directly impacts its capabilities. Larger models can deliver better results for complex queries and mission-critical AI implementations, such as those in healthcare. However, smaller models consume less power and energy, making them more suitable for lower-powered devices like smartphones. Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini could significantly enhance on-device AI performance on mobile devices, where chipset power and battery life can be limiting factors.

Phi-3 Mini may have fewer parameters than its larger counterparts, but Microsoft claims it still offers impressive performance. According to the company, Phi-3 Mini delivers results comparable to models trained on more than 10 times the number of parameters. Although it may not match the capabilities of GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo, it is as powerful as GPT-3.5.

Microsoft achieved this level of performance by training Phi-3 Mini on a ""curriculum"" that included children's books. The company also used a larger model to generate AI-crafted children's books to supplement its real-world material. This approach allowed Phi-3 Mini to learn from a diverse range of sources, contributing to its impressive capabilities.

Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, with systems demonstrating human-like abilities in various tasks. However, unlike the human mind, these AI systems typically maintain consistent performance or even improve over time. A study by researchers at the University of California, Irvine aimed to emulate aging and neurodegeneration in AI agents, introducing the concept of 'neural erosion' to better understand complex systems and enhance their interpretability and security (Alexos et al., 2024).

The Study

The researchers conducted their study using IQ tests performed by large language models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA 2 model. They introduced 'neural erosion' by deliberately ablating synapses or neurons or adding Gaussian noise during or after training. This controlled decline in performance led to the discovery of a distinct pattern in the LLaMA 2 model's performance on IQ tests when artificial synapses and neurons were removed.

Key Observations

The researchers found that AI systems, similar to humans, lose their ability to think abstractly, followed by mathematical degradation, and finally, a loss in linguistic skills when their underlying structure is compromised. This 'neuro-erosion' pattern aligns with neurodegeneration patterns observed in humans.

Implications and Future Directions

This study marks the beginning of a series of investigations into AI neurodegeneration, with potential applications in AI security, interpretability, and dedicated neurodegeneration research in AI agents. The findings could pave the way for new techniques that leverage AI neuro-erosion patterns to address real-world problems.

The research team plans to extend their emulation to other neural diseases and neurodiversity, develop specific tests of AI systems, and apply their methods to improve AI security and interpretability. Collaborations with neuroscientists and a focus on exploring new frontiers in AI studies, rather than replicating human brain diseases, will remain a priority.

Title: Harnessing the Power of AI's ""Hallucinations"" to Combat Antibiotic Resistance

Introduction:
In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), hallucinations are typically considered a weakness. However, researchers from Stanford Medicine and McMaster University have discovered a unique application for this AI behavior in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Through the development of an AI model named SyntheMol, they have generated six novel drug candidates to target deadly, drug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii.

The Hallucinatory Power of AI:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health concern, resulting in an estimated 4.95 million deaths annually. To address this issue, researchers harnessed AI's ability to hallucinate and invent new information, which led to the creation of SyntheMol. This generative model designed 25,000 possible antibiotics and their corresponding synthesis recipes in under nine hours, enabling researchers to explore novel solutions to AMR more efficiently than ever before.

Designing New Molecules:
SyntheMol was trained on a library of molecular building blocks and chemical reactions, using data on effective chemicals against Acinetobacter baumannii as a guide. Researchers added constraints to ensure the feasibility of the generated compounds and filtered out those similar to existing antibiotics to prevent resistance. The result was a set of unique, viable molecules with explicit synthesis instructions.

Promising Results:
Of the 58 compounds synthesized in a lab by chemical company Enamine, six successfully killed a resistant strain of the bacteria. Two of these have progressed to testing stages in mice and have shown potential against other antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including E. coli, MRSA, and those causing meningitis and pneumonia.

Conclusion:
The innovative application of AI's hallucinatory capabilities in the development of SyntheMol has opened up new possibilities for combating antibiotic resistance. As researchers continue to refine and explore the potential of this model, there is hope for the discovery of new drugs to tackle AMR and other medical challenges.
