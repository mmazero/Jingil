Introduction

In the face of climate change and the need for cleaner energy sources, nuclear power has emerged as a viable carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. However, the recent cancellation of a next-generation nuclear plant in the United States has raised questions about the viability of small modular reactors (SMRs). This article explores the potential of SMRs, their benefits, and the challenges they face in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.

The Demise of NuScale's SMR Project

Last year, NuScale, a US energy company, announced the termination of its SMR project in Idaho due to soaring costs. Initially estimated at $5.3 billion, the project's price tag ballooned to $9.3 billion, leading to its demise. This collapse, according to MV Ramana, a professor at the University of British Columbia, should signal the end of SMRs. However, proponents of nuclear power remain optimistic, citing recent positive developments in the sector.

Positive Trends in the US Nuclear Landscape

Mason Lester, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, highlighted several positive trends for US nuclear prospects. For instance, GE Hitachi's new SMR design, the BWRX-300, is expected to begin producing power in Darlington, Ontario, Canada, in 2029. Additionally, the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned US power company, has invested in the BWRX-300, signaling a promising future for SMRs.

Managing Risks and Costs

The primary challenge facing SMRs is managing risks and costs. The NuScale project's failure was not solely due to high initial costs but also potential upside risks, according to John Kotek of the Nuclear Energy Institute. To address this issue, the industry needs to improve risk sharing across the first new models before building them with greater repeatability.

Innovation and Standardization

TerraPower, another US nuclear company, is focusing on molten chloride technology, which enables higher operating temperatures and greater efficiency. The company is also working on standardizing its projects to lower costs.

The main story
Y Combinator's Winter 2024 cohort held demo days this week, and the TC team was all over it. One interesting observation was the dramatic decline in fintech representation in their cohorts over the years. Of the 260 companies in the latest cohort, only 8% were classified as fintech, compared to 24% in the winter of 2022. This represents a one-third reduction in the percentage of fintech companies compared to two years ago. However, there were some promising developments in cross-border fintech.

Analysis of the week
According to CB Insights' Q1 2024 State of Venture Report, fintech funding slid by 16% quarter-over-quarter during the three-month period ended March 31. But what's even more concerning is that the $7.3 billion raised globally by fintech startups in the three-month period was the lowest level the sector has seen since early 2017. On a positive note, there was a 15% uptick in equity deal-making last quarter, with 904 investments made into fintech startups, which was higher than 786 in the previous quarter, indicating smaller deal sizes.

Dollars and cents
Manish Singh reports that Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal is in talks to raise capital for his new startup, Indian fintech Navi. Bansal is seeking to raise between $200 million and $400 million at a valuation of around $2 billion, according to three sources familiar with the matter. This would be Navi's first large outside fundraise since its founding in 2018.

What else we're writing
Advocates have been pushing for a green bank to underwrite smaller renewable energy projects, such as installing heat pumps in homes or retrofitting affordable housing. And now, that's a reality. The EPA has awarded $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations that will use the money to make loans to fund these projects.

High-interest headlines
Hapax, a fintech company, has launched a new tool powered by generative artificial intelligence for financial services. Houston-based tech platform Xoom raised a Series C round of funding backed by Mastercard. Brim Financial closed an $85 million Series C funding round led by EDC to fund its US expansion. Advent is set to buy Ryan Reynolds-backed fintech Nuvei in a $6.3 billion deal.

Blog Post:

Imagine a world where robots can autonomously climb towering structures, completing maintenance tasks or delivering essential supplies to hard-to-reach locations. While this scenario may seem like science fiction, researchers are actively working on making it a reality. A significant challenge in this field is enabling climbing robots to accurately sense and map their surroundings while determining their location within these environments. 

A team of researchers from Guangdong University of Technology has recently developed a new method to improve a bipedal climbing robot's ability to estimate its state and map its surroundings while climbing a truss structure. Their proposed solution, introduced in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, utilizes a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm tailored to a specific biped climbing robot, the BiCR, developed by their lab, the Biomimetic and Intelligent Robotics Lab.

Biped Climbing Robot (BiCR)
The BiCR is an electromechanical system that moves via grippers at both ends and rotates with multiple joints. This robot can be employed for installation, maintenance, and inspection in high-altitude and high-risk environments such as construction site scaffolding and power towers.

The researchers' primary objective was to allow the BiCR to autonomously localize itself and create a map of its surroundings while navigating truss structures. To accomplish this, they developed BiCR-SLAM, a SLAM-based approach specifically designed for the BiCR robot.

BiCR-SLAM
BiCR-SLAM is a simultaneous localization and mapping system that combines information about the BiCR robot's configuration, a LiDAR sensing system, and visual data collected by cameras. This framework can determine the pose of the robotic gripper and create a map of poles surrounding the gripper, allowing the robot to plan its actions more effectively while climbing a truss.

The system consists of four components:
1. Encoder dead reckoning
2. LiDAR odometry estimation tool
3. Pole landmark mapping model
4. Global optimization technique

In the global optimization, a multi-source fusion factor graph is used to simultaneously optimize the robot localization and",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-fusion-slam-system-t-1.jpg,2024-04-08 07:50:01,"Meta Description:

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-durability-technique-solar-variability-advancing.html,New durability evaluation technique protects against solar variability for advancing green hydrogen production, Revolutionary 1-Second Solar Irradiance Technique Boosts Green Hydrogen Production Durability Evaluation ,"Title: A Revolutionary Solar-Based Durability Evaluation Technique for Green Hydrogen Production

Introduction

The advent of green hydrogen as a promising clean energy carrier has sparked considerable interest. Among the various renewable energy sources available, solar energy holds a unique advantage: it can be harnessed everywhere on Earth, with minimal dependence on natural topography. However, the intermittent nature of solar energy output, which fluctuates due to factors such as season and weather, can lead to repetitive increases and decreases in power. This, in turn, may damage the components of production devices, making precise evaluation of the durability of these devices under power fluctuations crucial for determining the optimal timing for component replacement and developing new materials.

A Breakthrough in Durability Evaluation

Dr. Bora Seo's research team from the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has achieved a significant breakthrough. They have developed a durability evaluation technique for green hydrogen production devices with step durations as short as one second, utilizing actual solar irradiance data. This technique represents the application of the shortest step duration among developed techniques, enabling the most accurate simulation of fluctuations in actual solar energy output (Voronova et al., 2023).

The Inadequacy of Existing Evaluation Methods

Existing durability evaluation methods have not accurately reflected solar output variability, relying solely on simple methods such as periodic cycling or constant maintenance of current and voltage. Moreover, there have been no standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the durability of core materials for water electrolysis under power fluctuation conditions.

The New Simulation Method

To increase the applicability of solar energy to green hydrogen production devices, a reliable durability evaluation technique is required. The research team has developed a simulation method that converts irradiance values into current densities using actual solar irradiance data obtained from solar panels and water electrolysis stack data. This has dramatically shortened the step duration from 10 seconds to 1 second, allowing fluctuations in solar output to be accurately reflected.

Standardized Analysis Methods and Indicators

Based on the newly developed durability evaluation technique, the team has proposed key indicators for the material development of green hydrogen production devices.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/magnets-are-switching-up-the-keyboard-game/,Magnets are switching up the keyboard game, Magnetic Switches Revolutionize Mechanical Keyboards: Wooting's Hall Effect Sensor Technology ,"The Future of Mechanical Keyboards: Magnetic Switches

Mechanical keyboards have experienced a surge in popularity, evolving from a niche product to a mainstream favorite during the pandemic. Brands like Akko, Drop, Ducky, Epomaker, and Keychron have become household names, offering a wide variety of layouts and components. However, as high-end features have become standard, the market has become somewhat stale. Enter magnetic switches, a game-changing technology that allows for quick and easy customization of the actuation point, or the point during the keypress where the switch registers your downstroke.

How Do Mechanical Keyboard Switches Work?

Standard mechanical keyboard switches work by physically closing an electrical circuit when you press down on the key. The stem, the part that the keycap is attached to, has two legs that push against two metal leaves, closing the circuit. The shape of the stem and its legs are what differentiate linear switches, which have smooth stems, from tactile switches, which have a bump that provides resistance. The overall design of the stem, its legs, the spring, and the switch housing all contribute to the switch's feel and sound, as well as when the keypress is registered.

How Do Magnetic Switches Work?

Magnetic switches, on the other hand, use magnets and springs and activate by sensing changes in the magnetic field. This is achieved through the Hall Effect, which was popularized by Dutch keyboard startup Wooting and has been around since the 1960s. Magnetic switches still have stems and springs, but since there's no electrical circuit to close, there are no legs on the stem. Instead, a permanent magnet is located in the stem, and as you press down, the sensor on the keyboard's PCB precisely registers the switch's position.

The Benefits of Magnetic Switches

TSMC's first fab unit is expected to begin producing chips under the 4nm process in the first half of 2025, with the second factory producing 3nm and 2nm chips from 2028. The third plant is expected to start manufacturing 2nm and more advanced chips near the end of the decade. TSMC is investing more than $65 billion via these projects in the U.S., making it the largest ever direct investment by a foreign entity in a greenfield project in the U.S.

TSMC Arizona will sell its chips to its U.S. customers, including AMD, Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The three fab units are expected to create approximately 6,000 direct high-tech, high-wage jobs, and more than 20,000 construction jobs. This news comes on the heels of the White House's recent announcement that it had signed an agreement with the Department of Commerce to grant Intel up to $8.5 billion to shore up U.S.-based production. Additionally, Samsung, which announced a $17 billion additional investment in Taylor, Texas, is expected to receive more than $6 billion in grants for its chip facility in Texas.

The CHIPS Act is a vital step in ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the global semiconductor market. The U.S. government's investment in domestic semiconductor production and research aims to diversify the production of semiconductors and bring more electronics production to the West. By investing in companies like TSMC, the U.S. is taking steps to reshore manufacturing of critical technologies and build a more resilient and secure supply chain.

In conclusion, the U.S. Commerce Department's decision to grant TSMC $6.6 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act is a significant step in strengthening the U.S. domestic supply of semiconductors. This investment will help TSMC expand its fabrication plants in Arizona and produce more advanced chips. The CHIPS Act is a crucial component of the Biden administration's efforts to diversify the production of semiconductors and bring more electronics production to the West. By investing in domestic semiconductor production and research, the U.S. is taking steps to ensure its technological independence and national security.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tmsc-getty-ransomware-lockbit.jpg?resize=1200,863",2024-04-08 13:07:15,"""TSMC to Manufacture Advanced Chips in Arizona with $6.6B Funding from CHIPS Act - 20,000 Jobs Created.""

Welcome to this week's edition of our future of transportation newsletter. As we journey through the rapidly evolving world of mobility, we've got the latest updates on electric vehicle (EV) pricing, Tesla's strategies, and the latest tie-ups in the autonomous vehicle space.

EV Pricing: The Reality Check

Automakers recently reported their Q1 auto sales, revealing a significant mismatch between consumer preferences and market realities. A recent Edmunds survey indicates that 47% of American consumers seek EVs priced below $40,000, while 22% aim for models below $30,000. However, there are currently no new EVs priced below $30,000 and only four under $40,000. The average price of an EV in 2023 is $61,702, compared to $47,450 for all other vehicles.

With the average EV price being much higher than consumer expectations, automakers face pressure to sell inventory and are delaying future EV launches to invest in hybrids. Even Tesla, a bellwether in the EV world, has experienced a 20% decline in deliveries from Q4 2023, while EV upstart Rivian has posted tepid results.

Rewriting the Script: Tesla's Two-Pronged Strategy

In response to the EV pricing challenge, Tesla has adopted a two-pronged strategy of slashing prices and generating revenue through its Full Self-Driving software, currently offered as a free one-month trial to all customers.

Autonomous Vehicles: Partnerships and Developments

Waymo and Uber Eats have expanded their partnership in the metro Phoenix area. Customers can now have their Uber Eats orders delivered by Waymo vehicles in select Chandler, Tempe, and Mesa locations.

Meanwhile, Ghost Autonomy, which had raised over $220 million, has recently closed its doors, affecting around 100 employees.

Earlier this year, Apple introduced the Journal app with the release of iOS 17.2, allowing iPhone users to capture and reflect on their daily experiences. This innovative tool offers personalized suggestions with the help of machine learning. However, one default setting might raise some privacy concerns. Let's dive into the details and learn how to maintain your privacy while using the Journal app.

The Catch: 'Discoverable by Others' Setting

By default, the Journal app enables the ""Discoverable by Others"" setting, which uses Bluetooth to detect the number of devices and contacts around you. This feature is designed to improve or prioritize your suggestions when you're out with friends and family. However, some users might be uncomfortable with this level of tracking and data collection.

How to Disable the 'Discoverable by Others' Setting

To protect your privacy, follow these steps to disable the ""Discoverable by Others"" setting:

1. Open your iPhone Settings app.
2. Scroll down and open Privacy & Security.
3. Tap on Journaling Suggestions.
4. Turn off the ""Discoverable by Others"" setting.

Frequently Asked Questions

The Journal app was added automatically to your iPhone's home screen with the iOS 17.2 update. If you can't find it, search for the app through your list of installed apps or redownload it from the App Store if you've deleted it.
2. What is the problem with the iPhone Journal app?
While the Journal app offers a unique way to curate memories and jot down experiences, its ""Discoverable by Others"" setting might raise privacy concerns. This default setting tracks who you've been messaging, your music preferences, and suggests new entries when you're out with friends. Although Apple insists that this information is saved on the device and not shared with the company, some users might still feel uncomfortable.
3. What if I've never used the Journal app?
Even if you've never used the iPhone Journal app, the ""Discoverable by Others"" setting is still enabled by default. This allows other iPhones nearby to potentially detect your device via Bluetooth and receive suggestions for shared moments together.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/5f17488c6103ebeca33f1ed5cfd1b1ebf2741999/2024/04/05/ca836ca2-489f-4333-9b63-1e09daf1dc4a/journal.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-08 00:17:00,"Capture & Reflect with Apple's Journal App: Maintain Your Privacy
