https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/tesla-abandons-low-cost-ev-robotaxi/,Tesla reportedly drops plan to build $25K EV," Tesla Scraps $25K EV Plan, Focuses on Robotaxi ","

Tesla has recently made a significant shift in its plans for a lower-cost EV, which was supposed to be priced around $25,000. Despite this vehicle being a crucial component of the company's growth strategy, Tesla has chosen to abandon the project and instead focus on a planned robotaxi that will be built on the same small EV platform.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has denied any involvement in the decision to scrap the project, claiming that Reuters is ""lying"" in a social media post. However, he has also confirmed that the company has been working on both the robotaxi and the lower-cost car for a few years, and that Musk has wavered on whether to prioritize a traditional car or a futuristic vehicle without steering wheel or pedals.

In fact, according to Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, the CEO has been pushing back against his engineers' insistence on referencing a car with a steering wheel and pedals. Musk has argued that the vehicle must be designed as a clean robotaxi, and has expressed confidence that it will transform everything and make Tesla a ""ten-trillion dollar company.""

However, despite this, the project has faced significant challenges, including a lack of funding and internal strife between different teams within the company. In addition, Tesla has been facing intense competition from other automakers, particularly in the EV market, and has been forced to slash prices on its best-selling models in order to stay competitive.

Today, the fate of the lower-cost car project remains uncertain, as Reuters reports that work has stopped on the traditional car project in favor of the robotaxi approach. Tesla has not yet confirmed this information, but it is clear that the company is facing a significant challenge in balancing its growth strategies with the realities of the market.

Moving forward, Tesla will need to carefully consider its priorities and develop a strategy that takes into account the needs and preferences of its customers, as well as the competitive landscape. While the robotaxi may be an exciting and futuristic concept, it will ultimately be the lower-cost car that has the potential to make Tesla accessible to a wider audience and drive its growth in the years to come.

In conclusion, Tesla's decision to abandon its plan for a lower-cost EV is a significant shift in the company's growth strategy. While the robotaxi may be an exciting concept, the traditional car project remains uncertain, and Tesla will need to carefully consider its priorities moving forward. Ultimately, it is the lower-cost car that has the potential to make Tesla accessible to a wider audience and drive its growth in the years to come.

Tesla's reported U-turn on its plan to build a $25,000 electric vehicle (EV) has raised questions about the company's growth strategy. Despite CEO Elon Musk's denial of involvement in the decision, Reuters asserts that work on the project has stopped, with the company shifting its focus towards a planned robotaxi.

The lower-cost car was a crucial part of Tesla's expansion plans, as it aimed to make EVs more accessible to a broader market. However, the project has encountered several hurdles, including a lack of funding, internal strife, and intense competition from other automakers.

Although the robotaxi is an intriguing concept, the affordable Tesla EV remains uncertain. Balancing growth strategies with market realities will be essential for Tesla, as the robotaxi may not have the same potential to attract a wider audience as the lower-cost car.

Making Tesla vehicles more affordable is key to driving growth in the years to come. While the company navigates its priorities, an accessible and reasonably priced EV offering could significantly enhance Tesla's market presence and reach.",Technology,"Formicoders,News,AI,Technology,Innovation,Programmering,Coding,Wordpress,Python"

Introduction

In recent years, hardware manufacturers have developed confidential computing technologies, a method that ensures sensitive data remains secure while being processed through shared cloud computing resources. This approach isolates sensitive data in a restricted area, inaccessible to other users and even the cloud provider. However, researchers from ETH Zurich have discovered security gaps in this system, which could potentially allow hackers to infiltrate these systems and access the data stored within.

The Research and Attack Scenarios

The team, led by Prof. Shweta Shinde, discovered these vulnerabilities while examining confidential computing technologies in AMD and Intel processors. The researchers aimed to understand the processors' functionality, as they are working on an eavesdrop-proof smartphone based on confidential computing. The research revealed security gaps in the server hardware of two leading chip manufacturers, AMD and Intel.

Confidential computing relies on a trusted execution environment (TEE), a hardware-based component that isolates applications during processing. Accessing the application memory is only possible with an authorized code, protecting the data from unauthorized access during storage in working memory. This protection was previously achievable only through encryption on the hard drive and during transmission.

Hypervisors: A Key Instability Factor

In a public cloud, applications are isolated using a TEE, specifically from what's known as a hypervisor. Cloud providers use hypervisor software to manage resources, including hardware components and virtual servers. Hypervisors are essential for cloud services because they create flexibility, efficiency, and security. However, they also introduce instability, as administrative functions may open up various attacks, allowing unauthorized access to data stored in the memories of other active cloud users.

Limitations of User System Isolation

Although user systems can be isolated and protected, there are fundamental limitations to this protection. Communication between the hypervisor and the TEE is necessary, and the hypervisor must still perform its core tasks, such as allocating cloud resources and managing the virtual server running the secured system.

The Ahoi Attack: Exploiting Hypervisor Vulnerabilities

The ETH team launched Ahoi attacks, exploiting the hypervisor as a means of sending coordinated interrupts to the secured system at any time. This",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2020/computerchips.jpg,2024-04-04 17:06:03,"Meta Description:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, reveals plans to label AI-generated content across its platforms, promoting transparency and informed decisions. The new policy expands to videos, images, and audio, addressing concerns over manipulated media and fake news. Meta collaborates with industry peers and governments for continuous improvement.","Title: Meta's New Era of Transparency: Labeling AI-Generated Content

Introduction

In an effort to promote transparency and enable users to make informed decisions, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced plans to label AI-generated content across its platforms. This move comes after the company received feedback from its Oversight Board, public opinion surveys, and consultations with academics and experts. By introducing these labels, Meta aims to help users better assess the content they engage with and provide context if they encounter the same material elsewhere.

The Evolution of Meta's AI Labeling Policy

Originally, Meta announced the addition of ""Made with AI"" labels to images in February 2023. The company has now decided to extend this policy to videos, images, and audio clips generated by AI. This shift is primarily due to the rapid advancements in generative AI technology, which has made the creation and manipulation of digital content more prevalent and sophisticated.

Meta's existing AI moderation approach was deemed too narrow by its Oversight Board, which was established in 2020 to review the company's content moderation policies. Initially, the policy only addressed videos created or modified by AI to make it seem like a person said something they didn't. However, the board recommended that the policy should also cover any type of manipulation showing someone doing something they didn't do, given the recent advances in generative AI.

The board also argued that removing AI-manipulated media that doesn't otherwise violate Meta's Community Standards could restrict freedom of expression. Instead, they suggested a less restrictive approach where Meta would label the media as AI-generated but still allow users to view it.

Addressing the Concerns of Fake News

Meta and other tech companies have faced criticism for not doing enough to curb the spread of fake news. With the 2024 elections approaching in the US and many other countries, the use of manipulated media, such as deepfakes, poses a significant threat to the democratic process. By labeling AI-generated content, Meta hopes to help users identify and assess the authenticity of the content they engage with, promoting a healthier information ecosystem.

Just recently, I found myself in the midst of a surreal moment - an earthquake in New York City. As I sat at my table, observing a vase of wilted flowers from Trader Joe's, my world suddenly began to tremble. It took me a few moments to grasp the situation, but once I did, I turned to social media to see if others had felt it too.

""DID WE JUST HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE IN NEW YORK?""
""was that an earthquake???????""
""did everyone just feel that?""

The internet was abuzz with speculation and excitement. People from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and beyond shared their experiences, creating a unique sense of unity across a vast geographic region. It felt like the early days of Twitter, where raw authenticity was celebrated, and users could post about their mundane activities without fear of judgment. In those moments, we were all just people trying to make sense of something unexpected, together.

As I continued to scroll, I felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me. I remembered the time when Twitter was the primary hub for microblogging, before the dawn of Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and even platforms that have since vanished, like Pebble. Moments like these serve as a reminder of the value of a public town square - a place where people can come together in real-time, seeking reassurance that they aren't alone in their experiences, and that their world isn't falling apart.

However, the current landscape of the most popular town square has become increasingly hostile to those who don't fit the mold of crypto bros and Tesla stockholders. The sense of community has faded, and alternative platforms have emerged, offering a breath of fresh air. Threads, for instance, is a haven where individuals engage in thoughtful conversations about topics such as cherry blossoms. Meanwhile, on Facebook, I discovered that a new grocery store is opening in my neighborhood, yet there's no mention of the earthquake.

Yet, in those moments of uncertainty, I found solace in the connections formed through social media.

Introduction

Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce company, has unveiled an exclusive shopping destination called ""Bazaar"" in India. This new store focuses on affordable and stylish fashion and lifestyle products, aiming to strengthen Amazon's position in the Indian fast-fashion market against competitors like Walmart-owned Flipkart and Reliance's Ajio.

The Inception of Bazaar

Amazon quietly introduced Bazaar on its India Android app, following a recruitment drive for sellers that began in February. The company promises sellers a hassle-free delivery experience, zero referral fees, and access to an extensive customer base. Bazaar's offerings include clothing, accessories, jewelry, handbags, shoes, traditional and western wear, and home goods such as kitchenware, towels, bed linens, and decor items.

The Growing Popularity of Fast-Fashion in India

The rising popularity of affordable fast-fashion is increasingly driving purchases on various Indian shopping apps. As a result, it is crucial for Amazon to have a robust presence in a category where it has traditionally struggled in India. According to Bernstein analysts, the share of mobile phones and consumer electronics in India's e-commerce market is decreasing, while fashion has seen the strongest growth since FY19 and now holds the highest category share.

Bazaar's Offerings

Bazaar features trendy t-shirts starting at 129 Indian rupees ($1.55) and sneakers priced under $3. These competitive prices are designed to attract price-conscious Indian consumers who are increasingly embracing fast-fashion.

Amazon's Commitment to India

India is a vital overseas market for Amazon, which has invested more than $11 billion in the country to date. Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, maintains its market-leading position in India, while the e-commerce arm holds the second spot behind Flipkart. In 2021, CEO Andy Jassy announced plans to invest $12.7 billion in AWS in India by 2030 and committed over $2 billion to the e-commerce division","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1169388446.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 18:49:01,"Meta Description: Discover Amazon's Bazaar store in India, offering affordable fashion & lifestyle products.

Instagram Threads, Meta's response to Twitter, has yet to find its place in the world of social media. When the New York/New Jersey area experienced an earthquake on a recent Friday, users flocked to Twitter to discuss the event, pushing the term earthquake to the top of Twitter's trends. Meanwhile, Threads users also talked about the earthquake, but the term didn't appear in Threads' trends section until much later in the day.

The reason for this delay is that Threads does not use hashtags, unlike Twitter. Instead, users on Threads have adopted the convention of ""[term] Threads"" to tag topics, making it more challenging to track conversations. Additionally, Threads' trends are based on national conversations, whereas the earthquake was a regional event, which may have contributed to the delay.

When asked about the earthquake's absence from Threads' trends, the platform explained that trends are based on various signals, including how many people are talking about a given topic and how many people have engaged with related posts. However, the earthquake became the No. 1 trend on Threads shortly after TechCrunch inquired about its absence, highlighting the platform's inability to keep up with real-time trends.

Furthermore, Meta's plan to distance itself from political discussions may limit Threads' ability to compete with Twitter fully. Twitter became the home to breaking news and active topical discussions, especially after the San Francisco earthquake, which allowed both the founders and users to grasp the platform's potential. Former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey described this shared experience as a ""comforting"" sensation that brought people together.

Threads has 130 million monthly active users, making it the largest player in the ""fediverse,"" a social network of interconnected servers and services. However, despite usage declines, Twitter has remained ""stickier"" than some would have believed, especially given the wide crop of competitors that have emerged to challenge Musk's Twitter.

Moreover, Threads has already shown signs of failing to deliver a true Twitter-like experience. Max Read described Threads as the ""gas-leak social network"" in a recent newsletter, highlighting the randomness of the posts that fill users' For You feeds.

Introduction

Social network X has recently announced that they are expanding access to their xAI-powered Grok chatbot to Premium tier subscribers. This move comes after Elon Musk announced the expansion to more paid users last month. Previously, only Premium+ users had the opportunity to interact with the chatbot, but now, users paying $8 per month can also enjoy the benefits of this sophisticated language model.

Grok Chatbot: Features and Functionality

Grok, a Large Language Model (LLM) product, is now available in ""Regular mode"" and ""Fun mode"" for Premium and Premium+ users in select regions. Users can chat with Grok, ask questions, and even request summaries of trending news stories. However, it is essential to note that, like any other LLM product, Grok may occasionally return inaccurate answers, as seen in a recent example where the chatbot generated a fake headline about Iran striking Tel Aviv with heavy missiles.

Musk's Goals and Competition

Elon Musk's intention behind expanding access to Grok is likely to encourage more users to engage with the chatbot and rival competing products such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Anthropic's Claude. Over the past few months, Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI's operations, even going as far as suing the company in March over the ""betrayal"" of its non-profit goal.

Open-Sourcing Grok: Questions Remain

In addition to expanding access to Grok, xAI recently open-sourced the chatbot without providing any details about the training data. This decision raises questions about the latest version of the model and whether the company will be more transparent about its development approach and training data information.

Conclusion

Social network X's expansion of Grok chatbot access to Premium tier subscribers is an exciting development for users who are interested in exploring advanced language models. While there are concerns about the occasional inaccuracies and the recent open-sourcing of the chatbot without training data details, Grok's potential to summarize trending news stories and engage in conversations with users makes it an intriguing tool","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-06 05:55:24,"Meta Description:

In our digital age, resources like Google Books and Google Scholar have become invaluable tools for accessing a vast array of literature. These platforms allow users to search the world's most comprehensive index of full-text books and delve into academic research across various disciplines. However, a recent discovery has uncovered a troubling trend: the appearance of low-quality, AI-generated books masquerading as human-authored works.

A simple search for the phrase ""As of my last knowledge update"" in Google Books reveals a plethora of titles across multiple genres, including historical events, biographies, and scientific research. This phrase is often used by AI models like ChatGPT to indicate their limited access to current information. Unfortunately, many of these books attempt to pass off AI-generated content as human-written, undermining the credibility and trustworthiness of these platforms.

For instance, one book about the Boston Marathon bombing includes the phrase ""As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the case continued to be subject to legal proceedings, and the ultimate outcome was still uncertain"" when discussing the attackers. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that this author has published 50 other works in 2023, all between 50 and 100 pages long, covering various topics such as the Cold War, 9/11, America's founding fathers, ancient Rome, famous boxers, and famous Native Americans.

Upon closer examination, these books appear to offer superficial narratives that resemble little more than a Wikipedia entry or a ChatGPT fact-spouting session. Even more alarmingly, these AI-generated books are being sold on Amazon and other retailers, further blurring the lines between human and machine-generated content.

When the same phrase was entered into Google Scholar, a repository intended for human research, 19 pages of results appeared, including papers on topics such as at-risk youth, diabetes, autism, COVID-19, and airline pilot fatigue. While it is unclear whether these papers are also AI-generated, their presence raises concerns about the integrity of academic research and the potential for AI-powered misinformation to spread.

Introduction

I recently had the opportunity to speak with Eric Liaw, a general partner at the growth-stage firm IVP, which has backed successful companies such as Figma and Robinhood. With the recent closing of its 18th fund, amassing $1.6 billion in capital commitments, I was eager to discuss the fundraising process, succession at IVP, and dive into some of the firm's portfolio companies. Here are the highlights of our conversation, edited for clarity and brevity.

Fundraising in a Choppy Market

The fundraising process for IVP's 18th fund took place during a turbulent market period. Liaw mentioned that they were careful not to raise an excessive amount of capital and deploy it quickly, which some other firms in the industry did. By maintaining consistency in their strategy, IVP has been able to successfully navigate the challenging market conditions.

No Capital from Saudi Arabia

When asked if IVP took any money from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Liaw stated that the firm typically does not comment on its LP base. However, he did mention that they did not have capital from that region.

Moving to London and IVP's European Presence

Liaw, a longtime Bay Area resident with two degrees from Stanford, recently moved to London about eight months ago. This move was an organic extension of IVP's strategy, as the firm made its first investment in Europe back in 2006. Today, the European portfolio consists of approximately 20 companies, accounting for 20% of IVP's active portfolio, spread across ten different countries.

Drama Surrounding Klarna

There has been a lot of discussion around Klarna, a portfolio company that recently experienced a public disagreement over board representation. As a smaller investor in Klarna, IVP is not actively involved in board discussions. Liaw expressed his excitement about Klarna's business performance and looked forward to its eventual public listing.

Investment Opportunities in Social Networks

A significant milestone has been achieved in the realm of climate technology financing. For years, while banks have been funneling substantial capital into large-scale renewable power projects, smaller-scale ventures, such as residential heat pump installations and affordable housing retrofits, have been mostly overlooked due to their lower profitability. However, the demand for these projects is undeniable, leading advocates to push for a federally-backed 'green bank' to support such initiatives. This dream has now become a reality.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced the allocation of $20 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act to eight organizations. These groups will use the funds to provide loans for projects that promote energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A particular focus will be on communities that have been historically underserved, including tribal, rural, low-income, and disadvantaged areas, with over $14 billion of the funding earmarked for these groups.

Green bank loans have an impressive track record, as demonstrated by the Connecticut Green Bank's delinquency rate, which is comparable to other commercial lenders across both residential and commercial portfolios. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the official name of this new green bank, aims to attract $7 in private capital for every dollar it disperses, potentially even more. McKinsey estimates that the new green bank could draw over $12 of private investment per dollar on its balance sheet.

The U.S. is projected to require $27 trillion by 2050 to reach net-zero carbon emissions, according to McKinsey's estimates. Although the green bank's $20 billion endowment may seem modest in comparison, its capacity to stimulate private investment and serve as a recurring funding source, rather than a one-time grant, will enable it to generate an impact greater than its initial financial contribution.

Founders and investors are also expected to reap benefits from this new initiative. While the funding primarily targets consumers and small businesses, equity investments are a possibility. Moreover, the funding is expected to boost demand for market-ready climate technologies and signal to founders and investors that consumer-level climate tech tailored for low-income and disadvantaged communities has a viable market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1163558463.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-04-05 20:17:07,"""New U.S. Green Bank: Unleashing $160B in Climate Tech Investments.

Introduction

In the world of open-source software, a startling discovery was made by Andres Freund, a Microsoft principal software engineer. A backdoor was found in the SSH remote security code of the Debian Linux beta. The mastermind behind this malicious act was Jia Tan, the chief programmer and maintainer of the xz data compression library. This incident sheds light on the growing issue of malicious code infiltration and the importance of open-source security.

The Infiltration Attempt

The Linux community has been fortunate enough to avoid malware hidden within its core system—until now. Although the corrupt xz code did not make its way into production Linux distros, the consequences would have been dire had it infiltrated the systems we use daily. This incident emphasizes the significance of addressing security vulnerabilities and the potential dangers lurking within the open-source ecosystem.

The Role of Open Source in Uncovering the Threat

Contrary to popular belief, open-source software played a crucial role in uncovering the attack. Mark Atwood, Amazon's open-source program office principal engineer, highlighted the fact that open-source software allows for transparency and scrutiny, making it difficult for attackers to hide their malicious code. In a closed-source environment, the attacker could go undetected for years.

The Motivation Behind the Attack

While the identity of the attacker remains unknown, speculations suggest international politics or crypto mining as potential motives. With Bitcoin values soaring, the latter seems a plausible explanation. However, the true intention behind the attack remains a mystery.

Preventive Measures and Recommendations

Before the discovery of the trapdoor-equipped malware, the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) had already proposed policies for secure and responsible open-source software use. Post-incident, Dan Lorenc, co-founder and CEO of open-source software supply chain company Chainguard, emphasized the need to build up more in-depth defense across the entire open-source supply chain. Raising the bar for persistent threats is crucial in making it harder for attackers to succeed.
